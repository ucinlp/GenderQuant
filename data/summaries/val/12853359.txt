Construction is underway for a new freeway. The vibrations wake Bugs and cover him with dirt. Bugs confronts a beefy construction worker , and when he realises that a freeway going through his home, Bugs refuses to move. The construction worker tries to blow up Bugs' burrow, but only succeeds in creating a large narrow pillar with Bugs' home still intact. The construction worker continues to try to get Bugs out using a rock cutting saw, a bomb, a 60 ton weigh and a stick of dynamite, but Bugs always manages to outwit the worker. Finally the worker tries to pour a large amount of concrete on top of the hole, but when it dries, he finds out that Bugs diverted the concrete around his hole and defiantly placed a door and mailbox on top. A shot of local newspaper with a picture of Bugs on the front page with a head line that reads "CITY REACHES COMPROMISE WITH RABBIT!!", followed by a scene that reveals that the freeway is ultimately abruptly diverted around the hole . Bugs pops out to declare: "The sanctity of the American home must be presoived!".
