During the Great Patriotic War , two Soviet partisans go to a Belarusian village in search of food. After taking a farm animal from the collaborationist headman , they head back to their unit, but are spotted by a German patrol. Though the two men get away, Sotnikov  is shot in the leg. Rybak  has to take him to the nearest shelter, the home of Demchikha , the mother of three young children. However, they are discovered and captured. The two men and a sobbing Demchikha are taken to the German camp. Sotnikov is questioned first by the traitor Portnov . When he refuses to answer Portnov's questions, Sotnikov is brutally tortured by members of the Belarusian Auxiliary Police, loyal to the Germans, but gives up no information. However, Rybak is a different story. He tells as much as he thinks the police already know, hoping to live so he can escape later. The headman, now suspected of supporting the partisans, and a young girl are imprisoned in the same cellar for the night. The next morning, all are led out to be hanged. Rybak persuades Portnov and the Germans to let him join the police. The others are executed. As he heads back to the camp with his new comrades, Rybak is vilified by the villagers. Finally realizing what he has done, he tries to hang himself with his belt in the outhouse, but the belt becomes unfastened. He ties it more securely, but cannot summon the courage to go through with it a second time. Exiting the outhouse, he sees the door to the camp open, but breaks down in tears as he realizes he does not dare to try and escape.
