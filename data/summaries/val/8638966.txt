Linda  and her lover Carlo  committed a horrible crime: eight years ago they murdered the woman's husband, while she was pregnant with his son. They hid the corpse and since then they are running a small hotel near a popular fishing lake. One rainy night a drifter named Marco  arrives to the hotel, but he seems to know too many details about Linda's dead husband.
