A Man  awakens one morning with a hangover to discover that he has been taken hostage aboard his old, run down trailer which is being towed down the highway by a mysterious black truck; he desperately tries to find a way out of the sealed vehicle before he burns inside. Colin Cunningham describes the movie as follows: "Centigrade, in a nutshell, is about a guy who lives in an old dilapidated, busted-up trailer. There's no wheels on it. It's just laying dead in the weeds. [The owner] does a bad thing, and he wakes up in the morning and [the trailer is] rolling down the highway. It's being towed by a big, black pickup truck. The doors won't open and the windows won't break and he can't get out. That's essentially what it's about. It's about a man trapped."GateWorld - August 29, 2008
