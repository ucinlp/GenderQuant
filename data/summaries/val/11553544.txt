Everyone notices how different Andrew  and Gillian  look from their respective sets of parents but no one really makes a fuss about it. What is even more surprising is that the two have never felt close with the families growing up. Instead, Gillian becomes more closely attached to Andrew's parents  while Andrew feels more drawn to Gillian's parents, Bernardo  and Patria . Little do they suspect that this is because Andrew and Gillian had been switched at birth. Andrew's real father, Bernardo, a poor private driver, decides that Andrew will have a better life growing up with his rich bosses. So he makes sure that only he and his wife Patria know that he has switched the two babies when the mothers both gave birth at a provincial hospital. No amount of pleading from Patria can make him change his mind. Out of frustration, Patria resorts to maltreating Gillian. The latter finds comfort with Andrew's mother, Rose , and later with Mark,  a rich suitor. Jealous of Gillian's new found attention, Andrew decides to force himself on Gillian, an act which leads to the revelation of the secret of their parentage.
