Howard Rollins stars as assassinated civil rights activist Medgar Evers, while Irene Cara co-stars as his wife  Myrlie. The film concentrates on Evers, an ex-insurance agent turned activist, in the final years of his life as the first NAACP field secretary in Mississippi. In 1954, he is involved in a boycott against white merchants and was instrumental in eventually desegragating the University of Mississippi in 1962. His home in Jackson, Mississippi is besieged by bigots and he and his family are threatened with dire consequences, but Evers continues to work towards the goal of integrating his racially-polarized state. On June 12, 1963, however, the 37-year-old Evers is shot to death in front of his home by white supremacist Byron De La Beckwith.
