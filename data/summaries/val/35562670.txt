The framing story has young film student, Won-ju  and her mother Park Sook  hiding from their debtors in Mohang, a seaside town in Buan, North Jeolla. The bored younger woman sets out to write a script whose plot will use the place theyâ€™re staying in for the location, but eventually comes up with three variants, using the same basic idea in all of them. In each case, Won-ju's protagonist is a "charming French visitor" named Anne : in the first section, she's a famous filmmaker visiting a fellow Korean director Jong-soo  and his very pregnant and jealous wife Geum-hee ; in the second, she's the wife of a French motor-executive who comes to the same guesthouse to meet her lover, a Korean filmmaker, Moon-soo ; in the third, she's a divorced housewife who arrives with her university lecturer friend Park Soon  for some peace and quiet, after her husband left her for his young Korean secretary. Issues of infidelity are present in each story, as is a dim but muscular lifeguard  whom Anne meets while strolling on the beach and looking  for a mini-lighthouse. As each "Anne" interacts with the locals, including Won-ju, who works at Anne's lodging and helps show her around, certain faces, situations and lines of dialogue recur, their effect and implications changing depending on context and delivery.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}{{cite web}}
