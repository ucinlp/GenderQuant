A brash American movie producer, Steve Canfield , wants Russian composer Peter Illyich Boroff  to write music for his next picture, which is being made in Paris. But when the composer expresses his wish to stay in Paris, three comically bumbling operatives, Comrades Brankov , Bibinski  and Ivanov , are sent from Moscow to take Boroff back. Canfield manages to corrupt them with decadent western luxuries  and talks them into allowing Boroff to stay. He also arranges for his leading lady, Peggy Dayton , to ‘convince’ Boroff to cooperate. Fearful of his own precarious position, a commissar at the Ministry in Moscow summons a dedicated and humourless workaholic operative, Nina ‘Ninotchka’ Yoschenko , to bring all four men back home. Canfield succeeds in romancing her, despite her determination not to fall prey to the decadent attractions of Paris. He even proposes marriage. She and Boroff are horrified when they realise what changes have been made to Boroff’s music. They decide to return to Moscow. Canfield does not give up, arranging for the pliable Brankov, Bibinski and Ivanov to be sent back to Paris, knowing that they will be seduced again by the city's charms. Ninotchka is sent after them, giving Canfield time to convince her to give in to her love for him.
