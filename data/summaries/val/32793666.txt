 During the Java War, when Prince Diponegoro led a general uprising against the Dutch colonial government, the Dutch military occupy a small town in Central Java owing to concerns that they have been collaborating with Sentot Prawirodjo, one of the leaders of the Javanese forces. The village chief, Jayengnegoro, accuses elder Kromoludiro of aiding Diponegoro's forces; Kromoludiro is arrested and tortured by Dutch leader Captain de Borst. In response, village kyai Karto Sarjan sends one of his students to find Sentot. During Kromoludiro's torture, de Borst's second-in-command Lieutenant van Aaken admits that it was he who had informed Diponegoro's forces of the Dutch movements. Enraged, de Borst kills Kromoludiro and arrests van Aaken. Not long afterwards, Sentot's forces enter under the guise of dancers and attack the village from within, confusing the Dutch forces; Sentot himself arrives not long afterwards, defeating the Dutch forces before they can respond effectively. De Borst is slowly killed, while van Aaken dies in the crossfire.
