In Dorff's adaptation of the facts, Laren Sims is a single mother living in Destin, North Carolina with her parents and young daughter Haylei. Unable to afford Christmas presents, she pays with a stolen credit card, eventually is caught, and is sentenced to 90 days in a maximum security prison. Rather than return to prison when she is found stealing a second time, she goes on the lam with her daughter in a car she steals when she leaves a stolen credit card as security with the dealer while allegedly taking it for a test drive. They work their way across the country, supporting themselves by passing bad checks and using stolen credit cards while frequently stealing license plates in order to escape detection. Laren adopts the identity of a waitress she meets in rural Texas by stealing her driver's license. She and Haylei ultimately arrive in Las Vegas, where Laren applies for a job with Lucas McKenzie, a wealthy alcoholic attorney and ranch owner under the name of Allison. The two fall into a toxic co-dependent relationship and eventually marry. Laren embezzles $90,000 from her husband's business account and he subsequently is disbarred for reasons not made clear. In an uncharacteristic moment of honesty, Laren reveals to him that she is actually from Destin, North Carolina and has had problems in her past. Lucas uses this information to find out Laren's actual name and her sordid past. From this point on, Lucas threatens to turn her in to the authorities. In a state of fear Laren sends Haylei away to school and hires college student Kristin to help her with the horses on the ranch. The two become very close , to the dismay of both Lucas and Haylei. As their relationship disintegrates and the possibility of discovery grows, Laren decides to poison her spouse with Kristin's assistance. She buries his body under a bridge spanning a shallow creek, and it eventually is found. Laren escapes with Haylei and leaves Kristin to shoulder the blame. Returning to Destin, she encourages her daughter to contact her grandparents and return to them, then surrenders to the police and eventually commits suicide, by hanging herself in her cell.
