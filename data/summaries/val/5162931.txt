While walking her guard rounds in the country, 17 year old Doris Lang, daughter of a deceased werewolf hunter, is attacked by Count Magnus Lee, the 10,000 year old, long-lost vampire lord. Magnus intends to make Doris his new zombie vampire bride. Doris later encounters a mysterious horseman, D , whom she hires to protect her from the vampires. The young hunter becomes a pawn in a conflict between Count Lee, his daughter Lamica and the mutant servant Rei Ginsei. Greco Rohman, the mayor's son, also wants the feisty Doris for himself. When Doris is kidnapped by Count Lee, D battles his way into the vampire's gigantic fortress to rescue her. Lamica's loyalties are torn when she becomes disgusted with her father's lack of "nobility." There is a long rescue attempt, with numerous running battles, as D tries to defeat the count and prevent Doris from transforming into a vampire. Once D defeats the count, the castle crumbles and D escapes with Doris and her brother Dan. D sets off under a now clear blue sky. Doris and her little brother wave him off as D looks back briefly and smiles. He then rides off into the sunset.
