Daigoro is a monster who became orphaned after the military used Intercontinental missiles to kill his mother who did what she could to protect him. Only one man stood against that decision. He pitied the infant, and took it as his own to Japan and raised him there. But Daigoro grew too large and expensive to feed. The man made Daigoro an icon for a business. Elsewhere Goliath, a monster who has been trapped in an asteroid for a long time, went to Earth and battled Daigoro. Goliath eventually defeated Daigoro by striking him with lightning from his horn. Goliath then left to pillage the world, leaving Daigoro to die. Daigoro recovered and practiced daily for his next battle against Goliath. After an intense fight Daigoro breathed his fire ray and managed to defeat Goliath. The humans then grabbed Goliath while he was still weak and strap him to a rocket so they can blast him into space.
