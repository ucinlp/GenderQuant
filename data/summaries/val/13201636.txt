In a small Florida tourist town named Ticlaw, the Mayor/Preacher Kirby T. Calo  also operates a hotel and tiny wildlife safari park. The town's major draw is a water-skiing elephant named Bubbles. When the state highway commission builds a freeway adjacent to the town, Calo slips an official $10,000 to assure an off ramp. The ramp doesn't come, so the townsfolk literally paint the town pink to attract visitors. Meanwhile, tourists from various parts of the United States, shown in a series of concurrent, ongonig vigenettes, are heading to Florida and will all end up in Ticlaw, one way or another, including a pair of bank robbers from New York  who pick up a cocaine-dealing hitchhiker ; a Chicago copy machine repairman and wannabe children's author, Duane Hansen , who picks up a waitress, Carmen Odessa Shelby , who is carrying her deceased mother's ashes to Florida; a dentist and his dysfunctonal family , vacationing cross-country in their RV; an elderly woman, Carol , with a drinking problem and her loving husband Sherm , who are heading to Florida to retire; two nuns ; and a wannabe country songwriter hauling a playful rhino and other wild animals to Ticlaw, and more.
