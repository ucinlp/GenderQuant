Chris Martin  is a bachelor who wants to take the plunge and marry his long-time girlfriend. Wanting to enjoy his last few days as a bachelor, Chris spends several nights hanging out with his old friends, as they drink, swap stories, and chase women. What began as a send-off, however, might be something more serious when Martin starts having second thoughts about matrimony. Written, produced and directed by David Michael O'Neill.
