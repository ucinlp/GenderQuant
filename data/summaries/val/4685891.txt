Irene Vail decides to divorce to her husband, the rich ship owner Bruce Vail, after he falsely accuses her of having an affair. Bitterly jealous and possessive of Irene, Vail learns that he can prevent the divorce from being finalized if he can provide evidence that she has been involved with another man within six months of filing for divorce. Vail pays his driver, Michael, to go to Irene's hotel room in Paris and pretend to be her lover, with the intention of having a private detective catch them in a compromising position. However, an unknown man overhears Irene's startled cry upon finding Michael in her room. A struggle ensues when the man defends Irene against Michael's unwanted advances, and ends with Michael on the floor, unconscious. When Vail and the detective burst into the room, the man threatens them with a gun, demands Irene's jewelry, and takes Irene hostage. Once they are away, the intruder, Paul Dumond, returns Irene's jewelry and invites her to dine with him at the Château Bleu restaurant. They dance the night away and Irene falls madly in love with the charming and handsome Paul. In the morning, Irene returns to find Vail and the police in her room, for Michael is dead. Vail leads her to believe that Paul is responsible for his death, and blackmails her into coming back to America with him in exchange for Paul's freedom. Distraught that he is unable to find Irene, Paul reads in the newspaper that Irene has reunited with her husband and left for America. Sensing something is wrong, he embarks for the United States to find her, accompanied by Cesare, his good friend and head chef of Château Bleu. In Manhattan, Paul and Cesare rehabilitate a restaurant, with the hope that the its notoriety will cause Irene to come to dine. The reunion takes place at last, but the happiness is short-lived when Paul learns that a man has been arrested in Paris for Michael's murder. Unwilling to let an innocent man pay for his crime, Paul and Irene embark for Paris on Bruce Vail's ship the Princes Irene. Because of Vail's demands to break a speed record despite poor weather conditions, the ship strikes an iceberg. Vail commits suicide upon learning of the catastrophe, and confesses to killing Michael in his suicide note. Remaining on the wreck, Paul and Irene will be saved by a passage vessel.
