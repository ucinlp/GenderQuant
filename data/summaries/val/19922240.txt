Two condemned soldiers  and their overseeing West Point officer survive a Nazi ambush on their way to execution. They make their way to a desolate Italian village which happens to be in the path of a German advance. While there they learn the meaning of self sacrifice and courage when they become emotionally involved in the people and fortunes of the town and must defend the village from the invading Nazi force.Charles Ambler, Wild East DVD Case, 2007.
