{{Plot}} high wire by his feet. Tom slicks across the wire and stomps on it repeatedly to bounce Jerry into his hands. He then walks over the wire back to the ramp, only to run into the irate elephant. It uses its weight to pull both of them all the way down to the ground with the high wire, pulls the mouse into its trunk via suction, then releases the cat, launching him out of the circus tent. Later, Tom chases Jerry into a ladder that leads to a diving board. Jerry sees the bowl of water {{convert}} down and holds back until Tom approaches and he can see no alternative. Tom barely misses the mouse and ends up diving himself. Jerry makes a successful dive, and the elephant happens to come by and drink all the water, taking Jerry away with it. Tom, still in midair, sees the empty bowl and points down in dismay before impact. Tom crashes through the ground with such force he falls all the way into hell. A devil takes him back up to the surface and throws him out, as if to say that it is not yet Tom's time. The elephant is now back in its stable playing with Jerry, throwing him up into the air and then sucking him back to its trunk. Tom sticks out a stick with a pepper shaker on one end and shakes pepper into the elephant's snout. It elicits a gigantic sneeze which throws Jerry miles and miles from the circus. Tom runs backwards with a baseball glove to catch the mouse, but somehow the elephant has come near Tom. He runs up the elephant's leg and perches himself to catch the mouse, but the elephant rolls up its trunk and throws the cat off him. It then catches the glove and also catches Jerry, and proceeds to hug the mouse again. Jerry and the elephant are now leading the circus parade, with Jerry playing the bugle and the elephant playing a very loud drum which causes the cymbals to rise and then crash together. Tom hides in a manhole to create violence at the parade by putting a dynamite on the road so it will explode when the elephant stomps on the switch. However, the crashing pushes the dynamite stick back with Tom as he closes the manhole, without knowing it. The elephant steps on the switch and Tom meets exploding defeat and waves a "The End" flag.
