The Stooges are children and Ted Healy is the father. Unable to sleep, the Stooges ask Healy to tell them a bedtime story. He proceeds to tell them of the "Ride of Paul Revere" as well as the "The Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe". Briefly veering away from the slapstick, there are two musical interludes pertaining to the stories.
