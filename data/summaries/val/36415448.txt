Droopy is presented here as a manservant working for an unseen master, who is going away for a few days with the head butler, Mr. Theeves. As they are packing the master's clothes, Mr. Theeves requests that Droopy acquire someone to help him around the house while they are away, and the first person to come to Droopy's mind is his identical twin brother, Drippy. Droopy contacts Drippy at O'Brien's Gymnasium and explains the situation to him. Drippy arrives later on and displays his superhuman strength by punching his way through the front door before greeting Droopy. Droopy introduces Drippy to Mr. Theeves, who is briefly astonished by Drippy's uncanny resemblance to Droopy, thinking he was seeing double, and is also on the receiving end of Drippy's immense strength while shaking his hand. Mr. Theeves then explains Drippy's duties to him, and tells him that no matter what, no strangers are allowed on the premises. However, while Droopy loads the master's suitcase into his limousine, his old enemy, Spike the Irish bulldog, asks if Droopy can put him up for a little while, since he has had little to no good luck recently. Droopy reluctantly agrees and has Spike go to the back door. As Spike snidely muses about taking advantage of Droopy, the back door opens, but what Spike is unaware of is that it is Drippy who has answered. Spike promptly demands, "Let me have it, pal," and Drippy responds by punching Spike across the terrace. Spike gets caught in a veranda which swings him back into the door as Drippy closes it. Droopy then appears and lets a bewildered Spike inside, but as Droopy fetches some food, Drippy comes back into the kitchen and hits Spike outside with the kitchen table. Droopy, unaware, takes Spike's food outside, assuming Spike wanted to eat in the patio. As Droopy goes back for mustard, Drippy appears again and throws Spike into the swimming pool, leaving him dazed. Droopy then rescues Spike, assuming he wanted to go for a swim, and takes him inside the house. Droopy puts some dry clothes on Spike, but while he goes for some shoes, Drippy appears again and knocks Spike out cold. Droopy, assuming Spike was sleepy, tucks him in bed. Spike wakes up and begins to enjoy the comfort, but when he tries to call Droopy, Drippy responds instead and punches Spike into the bathroom, where Droopy is shaving. Spike accuses Droopy of assaulting him, but Droopy responds by recommending a cold shower for Spike. Expectedly, Drippy goes for a shower as well and hits Spike out, stark naked. Droopy offers to get Spike some clothes, but this time, Spike demands that he accompany Droopy. As Droopy enters a corridor, Drippy appears through another and hits Spike with a shillelagh. Spike angrily demands that Droopy hand it over, but Droopy denies having one. Each time Spike puts Droopy in the corridor, Drippy appears through the other and hits Spike. Assuming it is Droopy hurting him, Spike demands that he stop, but Droopy denies having touched Spike all day. Now believing that Droopy may be going crazy, Spike discreetly calls an ambulance. When the ambulance arrives, Spike calls Droopy, but this time, both Droopy and a surprisingly-friendly Drippy answer. Shocked at the sight of two Droopys, Spike goes berserk and he himself is taken away by the ambulance.
