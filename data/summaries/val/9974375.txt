In a rich-boy/poor-girl story (along the lines of "[[Love Story , college students Michael Hillyard  and Nancy McAllister  are in love, much to the chagrin of Hillyard's disapproving mother, Marion . Michael and Nancy, visiting a park overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, hide a costume jewelry necklace under a large rock, promising that they will love each other as long as it remains undisturbed . Marion — whose relationship with her son is so tense that Michael calls his mother by her first name — is convinced that Nancy is below Michael's class, so she tries to intervene. Michael, making it clear that he isn't going to choose her over Nancy, storms out of the matriarch's home. Sensing the urgency of the moment and the matter, Michael calls Nancy with plans to elope. On the way to the ceremony, with Michael's best friend Ben Avery  in attendance, the three are involved in a horrible car crash. All three survive, but Michael is comatose. Marion makes a deal with Nancy, who is heavily bandaged in the hospital with severe facial damage. Marion will send her to California and pay for the best plastic surgeons to restore her face and finish her education  there. The catch is that Nancy must not return to Boston or contact Michael again unless he contacts her, with the implication being that he will decide if he wants the relationship to continue after the trauma of the accident. Believing that Michael will find her once he wakes up, Nancy agrees. Marion then tells Michael, when he has come out of his coma, that Nancy died in the car wreck. Time passes and, once healed, Nancy changes her name to Marie Adamson and becomes a successful photographer. Michael becomes a successful architect, designing multimillion-dollar business skyscrapers. His company takes a contract to design a building in San Francisco. Seeing a photograph that he admires, he tracks down the artist to ask her to paint a mural for the building's lobby. He doesn't recognize Nancy but she knows him on sight. Believing that he had discarded her, "Marie" refuses the offer. When he is persistent, she eventually gives Michael a photo and tells him to do what he likes with it. He has it put on a billboard on the side of a large truck, part of his campaign to break down her resistance. They develop a working relationship, Michael finding himself drawn to "Marie" in a way he cannot understand. He is puzzled by her strange behavior towards him. When she asks him about the scar above his eyebrow , Michael becomes terse and Marie takes it as a signal that he has forgotten all about her. Eventually, unable to contain her feelings of abandonment, she flees to the East Coast. After being assaulted by "Marie's" boyfriend when he shows up at their apartment demanding to see her, Michael looks up at the wall to recognize a completed painting which Nancy had only partially finished during their romance. He finally realizes "Marie" is actually Nancy. Told that she has gone to Boston, he returns there. In the climactic scene, Nancy reaches the rock. After a struggle, she dislodges it — to discover that the necklace is not there. While she tries to understand, Michael appears with the necklace in hand, having gotten there first. He poignantly informs her that she can't have it, because it belonged to a friend of his, whom he had been told had died in a car crash. This sets the stage for a romantic embrace.
