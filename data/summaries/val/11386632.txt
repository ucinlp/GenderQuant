Shot on digital video, Boat features closeup shots of a man  taking a speedboat onto a lake, while a young woman  provides a dreamy, confused description of what is happening. Halfway through, Lynch turns to the camera and announces "we're going to try to go fast enough to go into the night". He speeds up the boat, which does indeed travel into the night.
