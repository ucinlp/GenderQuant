The Duncan family plans to go to Amy's parents in Palm Springs, California for Christmas. However, they are separated on route when Teddy  makes a snap decision to give up her airline seat for a free ticket for her spring-break trip to Florida with her best friend Ivy. Unwilling to let her daughter travel alone, Amy  also disembarks the plane, only to discover that the next flight to Palm Springs departs after Christmas. Meanwhile, the rest of the family arrives in Palm Springs, but things aren’t any easier as Bob  tries to care for Charlie  under the watchful eye of Amy’s mother Petunia , who strongly dislikes Bob; PJ  learns the pros and cons of his grandparents’ pool after getting a sunburn; and Gabe  quickly realizes the downfalls of teaching Grandpa Hank  how to play his favorite video game after Grandpa becomes addicted to it. Stranded and in desperation, Teddy and Amy find unconventional ways to get to Palm Springs before Christmas, while keeping in contact with Bob via cellphone. On their journey, Amy reveals that she is pregnant again when they hitch hike with two strangers who turn out to be part of an alien abduction survivors network. When the two arrive in Las Vegas, they get into an argument, where Amy promptly blames Teddy for them getting them lost in the first place; they later make up. Hungry, they sing and perform Christmas carols to get money for food, arguing and making people laugh, as someone has stolen their luggage. Amy then wants to turn their arguments into a Broadway Musical. Later, they find the girl named Jordan who had stolen their luggage and confront her. She apologizes for stealing it, breaking down in tears and explaining her situation. Teddy then gives her free plane ticket to Jordan, saying that she doesn't mind losing it if it means getting Jordan home to her family for Christmas. This gesture helps Teddy and Amy bond from their previous arguments, and shows Amy that Teddy is responsible. PJ, Bob, and Gabe travel to Las Vegas to get Amy and Teddy, but are mistakenly kidnapped on the way and participate in a paintball match based on Gabe's video game so that they can return to their car. Gabe wins the match by taking the "Stone of Mitrios", which he was already planning to do. In return, they get a free helicopter ride to save Teddy and Amy. Grandpa and Grandma then arrive with Charlie by car, and the entire family is finally reunited. Amy admits not only that they finally got the Christmas vacation they wanted, but also that this was the best Christmas they've ever had. She then reveals that she is having another baby, much to the happiness of the Duncans. In the epilogue, on the way back to Denver from their Christmas trip, Gabe attempts to take the "Stone of Mitrios" on the plane ride back, but it is taken away by a flight attendant. Another flight attendant then announces the offering of a free plane ticket, which Teddy quickly accepts once again. Amy says to Bob, "Your turn", as in it is his turn to go along with Teddy in leaving the plane. Bob obediently goes after Teddy, jokingly reminding Amy that they will be back by New Year's. Amy smiles in response and says that she knows they won't. A short blooper roll follows the epilogue.
