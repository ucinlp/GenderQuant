In the early 1960s, Geraldine Cummins was walking home alone from the movies when she was jumped and raped by a black man. Stunned, she returned home to her husband Bob, stating she had been raped. Sometime later, she finds she is pregnant. In the beginning she hates the thought of her unborn baby, not wanting a constant reminder of her rapist, but keeps it for a few reasons: she is Catholic and she harbors a small hope that it could be her husband's baby. Her husband is supportive during the pregnancy. As the months pass, Gerry comes to be attached to the baby, later stating "8 months is too long to close your heart to a piece of yourself." She becomes fearful of what will happen if her baby is black, the social isolation it would receive and what people would think of her. After going into labor and confiding in a doctor her situation, she becomes convinced that it would be best if she gave it up. The baby is a black girl. She names her newborn daughter Barbra Anne Cummins and gives her to foster mother Corrine Burrel, a black woman in a black neighborhood. Gerry is heartbroken to give up her daughter. Seven years later, Barbra is a happy little girl, but wonders about her birth parents. Corrine assures her that she is her mother, though not her birth mother. A few months later, a social worker comes into their home and informs Corrine that Barbra will be adopted by white people living in Wisconsin. Corrine seeks legal action, looking to adopt Barbra for herself, but as she is divorced with no job and many children, she is turned down. Barbra is taken kicking from Corrine and the family she has come to know. Later, Corrine reports that the social worker sent her a letter saying that Barbra was happy, but Corrine knew that they emotionally "killed" Barbra when they took her. Annalise's husband Paul is not very happy to be adopting a colored seven-and-a-half year old, but Annalise is thrilled. After a while, Annalise becomes worried about Barbra's very detached nature and suggests to Paul they move to a suburban neighborhood where Barbra could be around other black kids. Paul is angry that they have to change everything for a child he did not want, but agrees, only to leave them after moving. Annalise opts to go to work during the day and to school at night to support them. Barbra has once again receded into herself after the neighborhood children make fun of her for being black with a white mother, calling her 'Oreo' and 'nigger'. Over the years until she is 16, she is alone without her mother or friends. At 16 she meets Don, a football playing choirboy. She falls in love with him and ultimately gets pregnant. Annalise comes home one day to learn that Barbra has a boyfriend and has been in the house alone with her when she was not there. After a mild argument, Barbra leaves. Barbra does not come home that night and Annalise calls the school. She is told her daughter is 4 months pregnant. Barbra then moves in with Don and his family. Years later, in the middle of Barbra's third pregnancy, the doctor suggests she look into her birth family history for medical reasons. This leads her in search for her mother. She visits Corrine and is told the truth about her real mother. Barbra is emotionally conflicted; whether to believe her father's a rapist or her mother's a liar. Barbra now has 5 children and has been married to Don for 17 years but still displays sadness over her family history. After a night of contemplation, she decides to seek her birth mother out. Geraldine's husband Bob has died and her own children have left home, so she now lives alone. Barbra finds her though marriage records and contacts Geraldine's twin brother, Gerald. She reveals that she is looking for her mother and leaves her name and number for him to relay to Geraldine. However, he goes on vacation and does not get to tell Gerry for a week. She tells her brother that the woman who called is her daughter. He is visibly disappointed that she could just give up her own child like that  but she explains she was raped by a black man. He warns her that everyone will know she was raped by admitting Barbara is her daughter, but Gerry says she does not care. Gerald gives her his blessing. Gerry calls Barbra and tearfully/happily admits to be her mother. Revitalized by the happiness of knowing she was wanted by both her birth mother and foster mother, Barbra reconciles with Annalise. Anxiously, Gerry and her 3 grown children wait at the airport for Barbra's arrival. Then finally, after 34 years, mother and daughter meet. After a nice dinner with her new-found family, Gerry and Barbra have a bit of a tense conversation about Barbra's paternity. Barbra reveals she hates her father, but Gerry replies that she forgave him the minute she saw Barbra. She also says that the day she gave her up was the worst day of her life. Barbra is angry as to why Gerry gave her up if she loves her, asking if it would have made a difference if she had been born white. Gerry shamefully replies that she probably would have, because she was afraid every time she looked at her she'd see her rapist. But now, she only sees her daughter. Gerry says she only wanted the best for Barbra, to be with people who could teach her courage, which she could not, because Gerry felt ashamed for being raped and having a black daughter, though she loved her. Gerry apologizes to Barbra and the two reconcile as mother and daughter. Later, at a family reunion, Corrine, Gerry and Annalise meet again for the first time. The film ends with a picture of the entire side of Barbra's family, her mothers, her uncles, her brothers and sisters, her children, and her nieces and nephews, black and white together, and Barbra no longer feels like one person alone without a family.
