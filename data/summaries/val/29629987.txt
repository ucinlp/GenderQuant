Maxine Noelle Westray  is a beautiful and wealthy girl, yet she is incredibly spoiled and bratty. Born on Christmas, she only sees that day as a time for lavish and expensive gifts. Her overworked executive mother  is struggling to provide "suitable" gifts for her young children. A disillusioned young minister  does not see Christmas as a minister should. Then one day a drifter  comes into town and changes these three people's lives forever by teaching them the true meaning of Christmas and that the best gift of all doesn't come in wrapping.
