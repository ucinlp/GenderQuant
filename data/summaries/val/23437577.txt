During an emergency medical mission to a distant star system, the starship USS Challenger, is attacked by the Specks, a tiny alien ship less than an inch long. The Specks, prideful and convinced of their superiority, ruthlessly blast the starship's hull confident they'll succeed, but they're so small their weapons merely scratch the paint! The Challenger must get away from the Specks to continue its mission before time runs out and millions start dying, but the Speck ship is so close that it lies inside the hyperwarp envelope, and any attempt by the Challenger to leave will destroy the diminutive warriors. Captain Ryan doesn't want to harm the Specks , but even a warning shot could vaporize the little ship. If Ryan leaves, he kills the Specks, if he doesn't leave soon, millions of people will die. Captain Ryan is joined by Andy, the outdated android who sucks up to the Captain so he won't be replaced, Katie, the telepath who becomes sexually aroused by the telepathic drug, Sara, the beautiful but hard-nosed helmsman, Tuk, a fierce warrior from a double gravity planet, and Max, the best First Officer in the fleet.https://reelwomen08.withoutabox.com/films/SpaceSpecks
