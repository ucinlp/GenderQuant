The film begins with a dead donkey being dumped in a lake by McCabe and his son. It later transpires that Tadgh killed the donkey after discovering it had broken into their field. The donkeys owner blames Bull McCabe for the death and demand "blood money". McCabe has a deep attachment to a rented field his family have cultivated from barren, to a very productive piece of land over a number of generations. The fields owner is a widow who, around the time of the 10th anniversary of the death of her husband, decides to sell the field. McCabe has been trying to buy the field from her for some time. She decides to sell the field by public auction rather than to McCabe directly. Unknown to McCabe his son, Tadgh, has been harassing the widow nightly for years. The widow believes McCabe is behind the harassment in order to force her into a sale. On hearing there will be an auction McCabe goes to the village pub and announces that nobody would dare bid against him for "my field". An American, Peter, whose ancestors are from the area, arrives in the village. He has plans to build a hydro-electric plant in the area and quarry stone for new "highways". Central to his plans is McCabe's field. At the auction Peter repeatedly out-bids McCabe, forcing the price up to 100 pounds, twice what McCabe can afford. Seeing the bidding war the widow stops the auction and insists there would be a new auction, with a reserve price of 100 pounds. Knowing he cannot out bid Peter and seeing his cattle thrown off the field, McCabe goes to the rectory to confront Peter, and the parish priest who has been supporting him. McCabe now discovers Tadgh's actions, expelling him from the meeting, and goes on to explain his deep attachment to the field. This includes the death of his mother while saving hay. Despite McCabe, Peter refuses to back down. In a desperate last attempt McCabe and Tadgh confront Peter at a waterfall he has just purchased, the night before the second auction. When Tadgh fails to defeat Peter in a fight, McCabe himself intervenes and beats both men in a rage. Peter is killed, and upon realising McCabe has a mental break. He confuses Peter with is dead son Seamie. Tadgh flees to the Travellers daughter he has fallen for. He tells her he has killed Peter. They plan to run off together. The Bird bids on behalf of McCabe and secures the field for 101 pounds at the second auction, unopposed. A Traveller boy spots the dead donkey floating in the lake and a crane is brought in to recover it. It inadvertently recovers the corpse of Peter. At the same time Tadgh comes home to tell his father he is leaving with the Travellers daughter and says he never wanted the field. The Parish priest arrives to confront McCabe about the discovery of Peter. Having lost his son and with the corpse discovered, McCabe insanely herds his cattle to the cliffs. The Bird follows Tadgh and tells him his father has gone mad. Tadgh rushes to stop his father but gets driven over the cliff by the heard of cattle and is killed. The film ends with McCabe attempting to drive back the waves from his dead son, and Tadgh's mother and the Travellers daughter sobbing on the cliff top. McCabe has constant doubts about the ability of Tadgh to safeguard the field. His older son, Seamie, committed suicide when he was 13. Toward the end of the film we discover McCabe blames himself for the death as McCabe told Seamie the field could only support one family, and Tadgh would have to emigrate when he grew up. Since the death McCabe and his wife have not spoken for 18 years. McCabe also revealed he inherited the field as he was the eldest son, and his siblings had no choice but to emigrate.
