Lin Vanner , is manager of an oil company. The payroll has been stolen in a hold-up. His fiancée urges him to pursue the suspect in hope that he will gain recognition. Deducing the road the robber may have taken over the border with Mexico, he goes along to intercept him. He shoots a man who shouts back at him and does not raise his hands when challenged by Lin. Too late Lin learns that the man could not raise one arm because it was injured and this was the reason for his shouting rather than complying with the demand he raise his hands; he was not guilty of the robbery. Troubled at his action and abandoned by his fiancée, Lin takes it on himself to tell the dead man's wife, Ellen  - but on arrival he is mistaken for an applicant for a helper to keep the dead man's farm going until his widow's son is old enough to take over. Lin believes that this opportunity has been given to him to make amends for his mistake and he gives up his position to labour as a man-of-all-work on the farm. The story is told in a flash-back when, with Father Gomez  by his side he tells the whole story, as he is being pursued by the police for another killing.
