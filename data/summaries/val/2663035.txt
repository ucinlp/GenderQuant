There are 666 portals on Earth that connect this world to the other side which are concealed from human beings. However, there are some who are aware of their existence and are willing to open the gates to obtain the power of darkness. Somewhere in Japan exists the 444th portal known as The Forest of Resurrection. In 10th century Japan, a lone samurai fends off a horde of zombie-like samurai creatures. Though successfully vanquishing the zombies, the samurai is confronted by a mysterious samurai and his league of warriors. In an attempt to take out the mysterious samurai, the lone samurai charges full scale but is easily killed and defeated. However, before dying, the lone samurai spots an ally behind him, arriving too late to save him. In present day Japan, two Prisoners escape through a forest and meet up with a gang of Yakuzas. There, they wait for the Yakuza's leader who coordinated their escape. However, when Prisoner KSC2-303  see's a girl  that they kidnapped, he immediately becomes suspicious of what they plan to do with her. After a heated argument, Prisoner KSC2-303 kills one of the Yakuza members who immediately comes back to life as a zombie. This results in the other prisoner being killed and resurrecting as a zombie too. The zombies are killed and Prisoner KSC2-303 escapes back into the forest with The Girl. The Yakuza decide to disobey their orders to wait for their leader and find and kill Prisoner KSC2-303 and The Girl. Prisoner KSC2-303 and The Girl come across a man crucified to a tree. Prisoner KSC2-303 steals the dead man's clothes and is confronted by one of the Yakuzas. They engage in hand to hand combat while the other Yakuzas begin facing problems of their own. The corpses of all the men they have killed and buried in the forest come back to life and attack them. Prisoner KSC2-303 and the other Yakuza disband their fight to battle the zombies. Though victorious, the Yakuza were only able to keep them down for a while. With the horde of zombies growing, the Yakuza call upon three assassins to aid them in their mission. However, their leader, The Man  finally arrives and confronts them. Angered that they lost Prisoner KSC2-303 and The Girl, The Man means to kill his posse. However, the Yakuza and Assassins take the upper hand and kill him first. But The Man easily jumps back to his feet and turns the Assassins and Yakuza into his own minions. One of the Assassins manages to survive and escape The Man's vicious attack and find Prisoner KSC2-303. She begins attacking him, initially emerging victorious but knocked out by The Girl with a log. However, another Assassin arrives to battle Prisoner KSC2-303. Though losing at first, Prisoner KSC2-303 makes his victory when The Girl distracts the Assassin. Having survived the fight, The Assassin is confronted by The Man and killed. Prisoner KSC2-303 attempts to force The Girl to tell him what is going on, believing she's been hiding secrets from him the whole time. She only tells him that his destiny is to defeat him. Before explaining thoroughly, The Man finds Prisoner KSC2-303 and The Girl. The Man begins explaining to Prisoner KSC2-303 that they both and The Girl are reincarnations of past lives. The Man plans to use The Girl as a sacrifice to open the portal hidden in The Forest of Resurrection to obtain the power of darkness. Unable to accept his explanations, Prisoner KSC2-303 attempts to kill The Man but is killed himself instead. The Girl manages to reach Prisoner KSC2-303's body and feed him a part of her blood before being taken by The Man's minions. During his unconscious state, Prisoner KSC2-303 has a flashback of his old pre-incarnated self from the 10th century. He is the ally that was too late to save the lone samurai. He and The Girl, who is revealed to be a Princess, are confronted by the mysterious samurai who turns out to be The Man. Unwilling to let him have her, Pre-Prisoner KSC2-303 kills The Girl to stop him from obtaining the power of darkness. Enraged, The Man viciously kills Pre-Prisoner KSC2-303 and Prisoner KSC2-303 is awakened in the present with the truth fully revealed to him. The following morning, Prisoner KSC2-303 confronts The Man and his minions for a final showdown. Prisoner KSC2-303 takes on the minions first and wins, leaving only The Man left. Prisoner KSC2-303 loses the battle at first but finds his strength in the middle of battle and decapitates The Man. Prisoner KSC2-303 rescues The Girl and both make their escape from The Forest of Resurrection. 99 years later, the world is destroyed. Apparently on Prisoner KSC2-303's behalf. A protagonist reincarnation of The Man travels through a ruined Tokyo and confronts an antagonistic reincarnation of Prisoner KSC2-303, holding another reincarnation of The Girl hostage. Having longed to obtain the power of darkness, Prisoner KSC2-303 and The Man engage in battle one last time.
