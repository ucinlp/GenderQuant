Jesse Stone still misses the Paradise, Massachusetts police chief position, which he lost because the current town council president, Carter Hansen , wanted his son-in-law, William Butler , to have the job. A suspicious police cruiser explosion kills chief Butler and officer DeAngelo . Curiously, the former town council president, Hastings "Hasty" Hathaway , appeared to know about the incident before the current town council president was officially notified. Jesse is reinstated as "temp chief" by Hansen and uncovers apparent  police corruption involving Butler. Jesse discovers a possible clue: the characters "2AH10" written on the April 24 page of Butler's desk calendar. Jesse attempts to reassemble his team, starting with his deputy Luther "Suitcase" Simpson  and then longtime assistant Rose Gammon , but both have moved on to other pursuits after choosing to not work with Jesse's replacement, thus Jesse is left to solve the case himself. State Homicide Commander Healy  also returns, along with Jesse's psychotherapist Dr. Dix . Thelma Gleffey  also remains in Jesse's life, and continues to work as a sales associate at Hasty's luxury car dealership. Gino Fish  is still in town as well, also still apparently in the illegal drug business while using his boxing business as a "front". Along the way, Jesse discovers that the most likely perpetrator of the cruiser explosion, a former associate of Gino, has apparently hanged himself. He learns from Amanda , Gino's executive assistant, that Gino "has a boss", whose identity is a mystery. An otherwise routine traffic stop adds an additional clue: there is an assassin, Arthur "Art" Gallery , who has been following Jesse. Despite finding a "deer rifle" in the car's trunk, Jesse lets the man go with a warning: "Don't follow me around!" The flashlight which was attached to the barrel of the "deer rifle" would have been illegal for hunting game, but would be quite helpful, if not mandatory, for the assassin's purpose, and Jesse made a mental note of that. To integrate all these seemingly disparate clues and to get to the truth, Jesse employs "carefully applied pressure" to former town council president and felon Hasty . After Jesse asks Hasty about the 2AH10 clue, Hasty panics and calls his people, telling them they have to "move it up" . The events are rescheduled for later that day, although a daylight murder/drug sale is risky for all involved.  At the shipyard, the assassin tries to murder Jesse, but Jesse tricks him into exposing himself and proceeds to take him out with five shots from his .45 ACP semiautomatic pistol, which is always at hand.  Hasty hastily escapes and is now "on the run" and wanted for drug distribution, money laundering and conspiracy to murder sworn officers and others. In the end, Simpson returns and it is implied that Rose may return as well. As Hansen's beloved son-in-law has been proved to be corruption-free, it is also assumed that Jesse's position as chief is permanent, and not "temp chief" as Hasty preferred to call him  The title "Benefit of the Doubt" refers to Jesse's  belief that police officers who appear to be corrupt must be accorded the benefit of the doubt, until proved otherwise.
