{{See}} Mildred Pierce depicts an overprotective, self-sacrificing mother during the Great Depression who finds herself separated from her husband, opening a restaurant of her own and falling in love with a new man, all the while trying to earn her spoiled, narcissistic daughter's love and respect. The miniseries follows Cain's original novel exactly, dramatizing nearly every scene and dispensing with the murder subplot which was added for the 1945 film. The dialogue is taken almost entirely word-for-word from the novel.
