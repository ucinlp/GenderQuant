A 38-year-old single man, Hong Man-Taek is a petty farmer still living with his mother. He still has wet dreams but is too naive to even catch a girl's eye. Man-Taek's best friend Hee-Chul always brags about his various sexual escapdes with women but actually he's also a pathetic single man. Seeing a neighbor married to an Uzbekistan bride and frightened by the fact that his own grandson will never get married, Man-Taek's grandfather decides to send Man-tek to Uzbekistan to find a bride. Man-Taek doesn't approve of the idea of buying a bride, but persuaded by Hee-chul, he decides to give it a chance.
