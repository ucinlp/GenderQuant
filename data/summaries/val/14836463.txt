Chandrakant is looking for job. Prabhudas mistakenly thinks that Chandrakant is son of a wealthy man. Prabhudas wants Chandrakant to marry his daughter Shanti. By the time Prabhudas learns the truth, Chandrakant and Shanti have fallen in love. They marry but go through a lot of troubles. Chandrakant builds a small empire by hard labour. Shanti gives birth to their son, Ravi. Shanti passes away after one year. Chandrakant always regrets that he could not give much time to Shanti. Ravi grows up and the same story of Chandrakant-Shanti is about to repeat between Ravi and Manorama.
