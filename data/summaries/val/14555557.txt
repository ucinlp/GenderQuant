Fuller Bull , the head of Daily News, an ailing newspaper company, confronts the reporters he hired for not getting him a story to keep up with a competing newspaper called the Daily Star Press. They tell him that the place was surrounded by rough guards and they're fired for it. Fuller Bull quickly catches three shirtmen outside thinking they're reporters from the Star Press and immediately hires them to get a picture of visiting Prince Shaam of Ubeedarn . Word has it that Shaam has plans to marry local wealthy socialite Mrs. Van Bustle . The trio disguise themselves as servants, and work their way into a party being held at Mrs. Van Bustle's home in the honor of the prince. Naturally, they all but sabotage the festivity. The inept trio serve hors d'Å“uvres consisting of peas and dog biscuits, and a turkey stuffed with a live parrot. The prince leaves in disgust, with the butler  following close behind. Undaunted, the Stooges manage to expose both the prince and butler as crooks who were planning to rob the house. The next day, the Stooges tells Fuller Bull that a man claiming to be Prince Shaam is not a prince and they had both him and the butler arrested. As a result of their findings, he is excited and tells the people to stop the presses for an extra. He gives the boys a large bonus and Mrs. Van Bustle thanks the boys for preventing her from a horrible fate.
