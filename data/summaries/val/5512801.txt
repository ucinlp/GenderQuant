The story involves a highly successful New York City family, each with its set of problems, and highlights the difficulties of the father-son relationship. Mitchell Gromberg is trying to deal with health problems resulting from a stroke.  His son, Alex, works as a lawyer in the firm that his father founded, but is questioning the usefulness of his work and his place in the family. Alex's son, Asher, does not take college seriously and seems lost. The youngest son Eli, while extremely intelligent, is entering a difficult pre-adolescent time, while being socially awkward. When Alex indulges in a thoughtless and careless brief romantic fling and his psychologist wife Rebecca discovers it, his marriage is threatened. Asher is discovered with illegal drugs. But major life crises, although devastating, bring the family together in a familial show of support, respect, and love.
