Harry Spikes is an aging bank robber of the fading "Old West." Injured and near death, he is found and mended back to health by three impressionable youths who are lifelong friends -- Wil, Tod, and Les. Later, encouraged by Spikes's reminiscences, they run away from home seeking excitement and easy living. Reunited with Spikes on several occasions, the boys follow his tutoring, ultimately resulting in the gravest of consequences.
