The film begins with the Munster family making a visit to the wax museum. They take a picture of themselves standing next to their wax replicas. When the family leaves, the statues in the museum mysteriously come to life and begin wreaking havoc across the city. Herman and Grandpa are then arrested for various crimes they did not commit and try to clear their names in time for the Halloween celebration at the Munster home. As The Munsters Today explains that the Munsters were asleep in a machine that did not age them from 1966-1988, it follows that "The Munsters' Revenge" is set in 1966. This would also explain why neither Marilyn or Eddie have aged in The Munsters' Revenge.
