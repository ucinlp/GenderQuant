Sylvester lives with his son in a city dump. Sylvester Jr. then decides to find a home for themselves. He finds one, but the lady who lives there only wants to adopt Sylvester Jr. and separates him from his father. When the lady puts milk in a bowl for Sylvester Jr., Sylvester starts drinking it but gets bopped on the head with a broom by the lady, who then takes Junior inside. Then Sylvester gets angry and starts knocking on the door and screaming: "Alright, you catnapper, come back with my son! Come on now, open up", but the lady hits him with the broom again, telling him to stay out. For Sylvester's next attempt, he takes Junior's can of "Pussy Kins Cat Food" and hides in the television. When the lady turns on the TV, Sylvester is shown eating the food, then he holds up a sign: "Ask for it by name", and starts ad-libbing a jingle for it: "Pussy Kins Cat Food tastes real good, satisfies cats like cat food should, hardens their muscles, softens their fur, Pussy Kins Cat Food makes them purr", but the lady gets wise and throws him out of the house and the can after him. Then Sylvester continues the "commercial": "Are youï»¿ getting more cat food lately...but enjoying it less?" Junior lets Sylvester back in the house, but when he hears the lady coming  Sylvester hides in the shower, but that is exactly where the lady goes. She absent-mindedly uses the cat to scrub her back, but he escapes and hides in her bathrobe which the lady puts on right after leaving the shower. With Sylvester unknowingly still in the bathrobe, the lady starts inserting rollers in her hair, but a few end up in Sylvester's head. When the cat pops up from behind the lady, she screams and he makes a break for it. Sylvester finally brings out the heavy artillery by placing cheese in strategic spots throughout the house, then filling the house with hordes of mice. Upon the lady's screams, Sylvester comes in wearing a super hero's cape and suit and announces: "This is a job for Superpuss!" He enters the house but is immediately thrown out by the mice who also eject Sylvester Jr. and the lady. The lady is infuriated with Sylvester and pounds him on the head for having her evicted from her house. The cartoon ends with Sylvester Jr., Sylvester, and the lady living at the dump. He is dividing up the chicken bones as in the beginning, but the lady orders him to git up here with that grub, before I turn ya wrong side out! Ya silly cat!!!" Junior refers to them as being "one big happy family...I guess."
