Eddie Serrano  is a widower with a teenage daughter Naomi . A classic workaholic, Eddie has not been there for most of Naomi's big moments. Naomi doesn't appreciate it and is always upset because her father embarrasses Naomi in front of her friends.  Initially, Eddie never expected the original "Team Mom" would go into labor so early. Subsequently Eddie substitutes her place for being "Team Mom" for the "Killer Bees", which is Naomi's team in the Spring Action Classic at Camp Hulka's Rock. His business sort-of way of doing things doesn't qualify the standards for his job as the leader for her daughter's team, which doesn't please the camp's director Ms. Hulka . Eventually Eddie begins to learn how to lighten up and go with the flow a little bit more that helps him succeed, not only with his daughter, but also the standards he needs to do to be part of the team. At the end, The Naked Brothers Band perform a concert with their song "If You Can Make It Through The Rain", followed by a fireworks display.
