Scientist Jean Karl Michael invents a death ray which, according to him, is for peaceful purposes. He arranges to demonstrate the ray to a group of European NATO representatives. As he is demonstrating it, a group of enemy agents disguised as NATO officials steals the death ray, kidnap the scientist, and escape by car under the cover of night. Following a pursuit and gun battle, they escape by helicopter which lands on a submarine and is discarded as the submarine submerges. About to go on vacation, Agent Bart Fargo is given the assignment, by his boss, of retrieving the death ray and saving the scientist. He travels to Madrid on a lead to find an evil organization that may be behind this. Rooting out a nest of spies in an ever-enclosing trail, Bart Fargo meets a lady when he hides in her house from the opposition and befriends an enemy agent who later helps him to stop the evil organization.
