Meanwhile, Tony is to be married the next day to childish heiress Vera Barton . She reveals to Tony's friend Lord Rufus Paul  that she plans to change Tony's lifestyle completely - no more smoking or drinking, among other things.

Later, Mary crashes Tony's bachelor party, dressed in drag in his younger brother's clothes. The next day, Vera and her father find Tony, Mary and his friends passed out on the floor. As a result, Vera breaks off the wedding. With only £300 and deeply in debt, Tony proposes a suicide pact to Mary. They will fly to Monte Carlo to try to win a fortune at the casino.

On their second chance, they split up to gamble. Tony loses, but Mary has an incredible lucky streak and wins a large amount of money. Meanwhile, Vera decides she wants to marry Tony after all. Rufus brings news about Tony's whereabouts and they go to Monte Carlo. Vera embraces Tony before Mary can tell him the good news. Heartbroken, Mary climbs out on the hotel ledge, but Tony finds her and tells her he loves her.
