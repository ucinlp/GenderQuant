Arjun Singh  and the Srivastav brothers, Raghu  and Shekhar , are neighbors in a gangster-prone area in Bombay. When Arjun's union leader father is killed, the brothers urge him to avenge his death. They get a sword and find the killers - and kill them. Arjun is the prime suspect in this homicide and the brothers get him to run to Delhi, where he begins a new life as a Real Estate Agent, Mohan Kumar Sharma. Years later, Arjun returns to Bombay and is welcomed with open arms by Raghu and Shekhar, who are now leading gangsters by their own right. Arjun also renews his romance with the estranged Srivastavs' sister, Sanjana . Sanjana would like Arjun and her brothers to go straight, and Arjun agrees with her and he starts to work on Raghu - the more flexible of the two - and partially succeeds - especially since Raghu is romantically involved with a school-teacher, who will have nothing to do with him unless he gives up all criminal activity. Raghu is seriously considering going straight when Shekhar gives him the devastating news - that Arjun is not who he claims to be - but a plainclothes police officer - who is out to get them by hook or by crook.
