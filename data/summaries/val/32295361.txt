Shiva  is a small-time thief in Mumbai who falls in love with Paro  from Patna, who is in Mumbai to attend a marriage. Shiva makes his way into Paro's heart and she also starts loving him. Shiva tells her the truth about him being a thief and resolves to give up crime forever. But before that, he decides to swindle one last person for a large sum of money along with his con-friend 2G . He tricks a woman on a railway station and flees with a trunk. This leads Shiva to Chinki, a young girl who was in the trunk instead of the wealth he thought was in the trunk, who thinks that Shiva is her father. Flummoxed by what is happening, but forced to keep Chinki with her as a police officer ([[Yashpal Sharma  keeps his eye on him. Although he tries keeping Chinki away from Paro's eyes, the latter finds out about Chinki. Angry and hurt, Paro leaves for Patna leaving Shiva heartbroken. Soon, unknown goons attack him, taking him to be a latter named ASP Vikram Rathore , Chinki's real father. Rathore looks exactly like Shiva which had caused all the confusion. While many unknown persons help Shiva run to safety with Chinki in his arms, he is soon surrounded by the goons. It is then that Rathore makes an appearance and saves the day killing every goon by himself. But Rathore soon dies suffering from injuries. The other policemen who had assisted the ASP then inform Shiva of the whole incident. In a village Devgarh, a MLA, Baabji  used to trouble and torture people and also annex money from them. One night Vikram Rathore tricks Baapji's son into killing himself by hanging himself from a tree by the belt of a humiliated inspector. Rathore was attacked by Baabji's brother on Dusshehra where he was stabbed from the back as well as shot in the head while trying to save a village child and was assumed to be dead. But he survived with a brain injury although the goons assumed that he was dead. Effects of this brain injury are later visible and these effects are diminished by water falling on his head. Shiva then adopts Chinki, who does not know that her father is dead. Then Shiva returns to Devgarh posing as ASP Vikram Rathore and heads to settle the scores with Baabji. 2G tells Paro the truth and she forgives Shiva. Shiva, being a goon handles Baabji well with tricks. He sets the MLA's wine factory on fire and makes the villagers rob his food store. A fight ensues in which he defeats all Baabji's men alone. In the end, he fights with Baabji and his brother on a rope bridge. Shiva ties the two to a rope and cuts the rope and both of them fall to their death. Shiva gets married to Paro and they leave for a new life with Chinki and 2G.
