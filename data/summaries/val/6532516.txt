Roger Marsh  and Frank Stewart , with their wives Kelly and Alice , leave San Antonio in a recreational vehicle for a ski vacation in Colorado. They decide to camp en route in a desolate area of central Texas, where they witness a Satanic ritual human sacrifice. After barely escaping with their lives, they report the incident to the local sheriff , who investigates their report but attempts to convince the men that they probably only saw hippies killing an animal. When the men refuse to accept the sheriff's explanation, it becomes clear that he is a part of the Satanic cult. The couples agree to leave peacefully, but Roger steals a sample of dirt stained with the murder victim's blood, intent on delivering it to the authorities in Amarillo. As the couples head towards Amarillo, they are pursued by a steadily increasing number of cultists, who are networked throughout numerous small Texas towns. Eventually, Roger and Frank purchase a shotgun and stage a showdown with the cult members during a high speed chase that pits their RV against a convoy of trucks. Frank and Roger kill or wound all of the attackers and escape, stopping to celebrate when they pick up a radio signal coming from Amarillo. In the middle of their celebration, the couples hear chanting outside their RV and find themselves surrounded by cult members. The film ends as the cult lights a ring of fire around the vehicle, trapping the couples inside.
