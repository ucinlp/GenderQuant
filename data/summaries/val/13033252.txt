Randall Thomasson is gunned down while attempting to talk his way out of a carjacking. His brother, Carl, attends his funeral and attempts to make amends with his niece, who is angry that Carl never contacted her or her father. Carl decides to investigate his brother's death, and goes undercover as a teacher, facing cynical and reluctant faculty, violent and disruptive students, and a system that -- to Carl's eyes -- has become broken from the inside, all while attempting to protect his teenage niece. Recruiting Joey Six, and a rather unorthodox janitor, Thomasson turns the school into an after-hours battleground, fighting against well-armed gang members, and -- eventually -- the school's auto-repair teacher , who is also involved in the gang's 'chop-shop' operation.
