Melissa  is a shy 15-year-old virgin who feels increasingly distant from her family. Her father works on a foreign oil rig and her mother  is too preoccupied with her housewife persona to notice that something is wrong with her daughter. The only person that senses Melissa's discomfort is her grandmother, Elvira . However, Melissa feels completely isolated when Elvira is carted off to a retirement home. Melissa's sexual education moves beyond her masturbation to a humiliating oral sex encounter behind the swimming pool with Daniele , the most attractive and wealthy local boy. Despite the less-than-romantic encounter, Melissa's crush on Daniele only increases. She fantasizes about Daniele to encourage an orgasm during gym class. She later loses her virginity, which again is not an idyllic encounter. Later she engages in a threesome with Daniele and his friend Arnaldo , fully realizing her sexual power and taking control of her sex life.
