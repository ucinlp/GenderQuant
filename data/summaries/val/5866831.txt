An attack on the sacred city of Alamut is planned by Dastan , an orphan in the Persian Empire adopted by King Sharaman ; his royal-blooded adoptive brothers, Tus  and Garsiv ; and his uncle, Nizam , after Alamut is believed to be selling weapons to Persia's enemies. Dastan leads a surprise attack to open the city's gates to allow the army in; during the ensuing battle, Dastan comes into possession of a unique dagger. Alamut's princess, Tamina , is arrested and agrees to marry Tus in order to achieve peace after noticing Dastan's dagger. Dastan unknowingly presents a poisoned robe, given to him by Tus, to his father, who dies upon donning it. After being blamed for the murder, Dastan flees Alamut with Tamina. When Tamina attempts to kill the prince, Dastan discovers the dagger can reverse time and only the one who activates it is aware of what happened. After an encounter with shady ostrich racing-organizer Sheik and his men, Dastan and Tamina head to Avrat for Sharaman's funeral. Dastan attempts to convince Nizam that he did not kill his father but Garsiv and the city guards appear and attack Dastan and he is forced to escape. Dastan catches up with Tamina and explains that Nizam was behind the murder because his hands were burned. Once Tamina finally explains everything about the Dagger, Dastan realizes why Nizam wants the Dagger of Time: to use it with the massive Sandglass to go back in time and undo saving Sharaman from a lion so he could become king. He fabricated the false allegations that Alamut had been dealing weapons to Persia's enemies so that he would have the opportunity to search the city for the Sandglass. However, Tamina warns that opening the Sandglass would release the sands, triggering an apocalyptic sandstorm that would destroy the entire world. Meanwhile, Nizam hires the lethal Hassansins to slay Dastan. Dastan and Tamina are again captured by Sheik Amar , seeking to rebuild his ruined business by turning them in for bounty. But that night, the Hassansin leader, Zolm  attacks the group with vipers, which are killed by Dastan with the dagger. Amar decides to go along with Dastan and Tamina to a secret sanctuary near India. They run into Garsiv's men. Dastan manages to persuade his brother that he is innocent, only for Garsiv to be fatally wounded by a Hassansin. The Hassansins attack, while Dastan and Tamina sneak away to the secret cave where they can hide the Dagger. After Dastan prevents Tamina from giving up her life to protect the Dagger, they are found and Zolm manages to snatch the Dagger of Time from Tamina. Garsiv saves Dastan from a Hassansin just before he dies. The group returns to Alamut to reveal the truth about Nizam and the Dagger to Tus. Seso  manages to take back the Dagger after a battle with Setam, the Hassansin who killed Garsiv, that ends up killing both men. Dastan confronts Tus and explains the dagger's mechanics to him and then stabs the dagger into his heart, killing himself. Tus brings Dastan back to life by rewinding time and realizes his brother has been innocent all along. But Nizam arrives, kills Tus, and takes the Dagger, leaving a Hassansin, Ghazab, to kill Dastan. Tamina arrives to help Dastan defeat Ghazab as Nizam goes to the Sandglass caves beneath Alamut. Dastan and Tamina go behind, and on the way Tamina kills Zolm with the Hassansin's own snake, while preventing him from killing Dastan. The pair share a kiss. They reach Nizam before he can pierce the Sandglass with the Dagger, but he knocks Tamina and Dastan over the edge. Dastan grabs hold of Tamina. Admitting that she loves him, Tamina asks Dastan to stop Nizam, saying it's been his destiny all along. She lets go of his hand, leaving Dastan devastated. Dastan pulls himself up just as Nizam stabs the Sandglass with the Dagger. Dastan grabs hold and activates the dagger. This causes Dastan to go back to the immediate aftermath of the invasion of Alamut. Dastan reveals Nizam's treachery. Nizam, realizing the allegation will be confirmed by an investigation ordered by Tus, attacks Dastan, but is eventually stabbed in the chest by Tus's blade and dies. After apologizing for the ransacking of her city, Tus suggests that perhaps Tamina should become Dastan's wife as a sign of good will since he is the "conqueror and savior of her city". Prince Dastan returns the Dagger of Time to Tamina and the two take a walk together. During their conversation, Dastan hints at his knowledge of the dagger's power and tells Tamina that he looks forward to a future with her.
