After a comet passes near the earth, most of the population becomes zombies, of the shambling cannibalistic Night of the Living Dead variety. A motley group of survivors holed up in an abandoned military compound includes a young  couple, a former porn star and her sheltered teenage daughter, a born again fundamentalist preacher, a gay man, an alpha male movie producer/rancher, a couple of soldiers, one male and one female, a high roller, and the preacher's infected zombified brother, chained up in the basement. Luckily for the boyfriend of the couple, who has been bitten by a zombie, the zombies in this movie differ from those in most movies in that their bite is not infective. While their food, water, and ammunition dwindle, internal strife hampers the group's events to come up with a plan to defeat the zombies pressing in on the chain-link fence surrounding the site; one by one they begin to fall victim, both to the zombies and to each other. The survivors theorize that the zombies have actually become infected in some way by alien organisms shed by the thawing comet. The plot takes an even more horrifying turn when vivisecting a couple of male zombies reveals the eventual end of the infection; after their genitals drop off, they become host to rapidly developing alien embryos, with the capability of regenerating whole new bodies if chopped up. Further revelations in the same vein occur when two of the female survivors, the teenage daughter of the porn star and the girlfriend, begin to display symptoms of pregnancy, despite claiming to still be virgins. After a long period of anger, the young boyfriend finally realizes that his girlfriend is telling the truth when she claims to still be a virgin; it becomes clear that is the form infection takes in human females. The teenage daughter, under the influence of the alien embryo, seduces the preacher so that the alien fetus can kill him; she dies herself. The rancher abandons the group to hole up in his well equipped and secure ranch. The young couple remain at the compound while the rest of the remaining survivors decide to make a break for it to forage for supplies, only to stall their vehicle just outside the gate and be torn to pieces by the zombies. The rancher returns unexpectedly with a load of supplies, realizing he needs companions to join him in his refuge. Under the influence of her alien fetus, the girlfriend shoots and kills the rancher. The young boyfriend attempts to operate on his girlfriend to deliver the alien, and anesthetizes her with some of the ample whiskey supply the rancher brought back; the alien abruptly leaves the girl's body, causing the boy to realize that all the uninfected survivors had described one common factor; all had been drunk at the time of the comet's appearance. Theorizing that the aliens were hypersensitive to ethanol, he doses the dead preacher's zombie brother, still chained in the basement, with whiskey with mixed results; the alien parasite cannot stand the alcohol, but this causes the zombie's head to explode. The boy and the girl, now cured of the alien parasite, leave the compound to try to survive in the outside world, now that they have a weapon against the aliens.
