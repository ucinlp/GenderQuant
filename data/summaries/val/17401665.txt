The film follows the true story of Dr. Dennis Slamon , who helped develop the breast cancer drug Herceptin, over the course of 8 years from 1988 to 1996. Dr. Slamon is a research doctor at UCLA Medical Center , where he has developed the experimental drug Herceptin, which he believes will become a treatment for breast cancer. However, when the drug company stops funding for research, philanthropists, including Lilly Tartikoff  and Ronald Perelman help him continue tests of the drug. Funding was done with an initial donation from Perelman's Revlon charity, and continued over the years with the "Fire and Ice Ball" organized by Tartikoff. Eventually the drug company funds the research and the drug goes through three trials before gaining approval from the FDA . Prior to the trials, the drug has a "mouse trial", with Nicole , a young mother with stage 4 cancer, receiving the drug first. Although her mother Elizabeth  pleads with Dr. Slamon, Nicole is not included in the subsequent trials as she does not meet the protocols. The women in the trials, particularly the first trial, band together. They handle their disease and drug trial, with humor—Tish , or with alternative therapy—Tina . The stories of Barbara  and Ellie  are followed throughout, as they go through the trials and eventual recovery. Some patients involved in the tests die, but ultimately Slamon's work with the drug changes the course of breast cancer treatment.
