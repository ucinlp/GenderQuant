This is a film documentary on Serbia, and the horns and brass. In Serbia trumpets play in the popular feasts where people dance and sing, but they also play in funerals: trumpet music accompanies the deceased also in his last trip. Not surprisingly, the trumpet became an emotional part of the life of Serbian people.
