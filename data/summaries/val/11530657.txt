Eddie , the owner of a sports shop, is single and indecisive about starting a relationship. While walking down the street he witnesses a purse snatcher victimizing Lila . After failing to retrieve the purse, they exchange pleasantries and eventually date. They quickly become serious, as they seem perfect for each other. Their relationship becomes threatened, however, when Lila is offered a job in Holland. When Eddie probes further, it is revealed that it is company policy not to relocate unmarried employees. Pushed by the urging of his father  and best friend , Eddie proposes to Lila and they get married. However, during their honeymoon, it becomes increasingly apparent to Eddie how mismatched the couple is. While driving down to Cabo Mexico, Lila continuously sings songs while listening to a blasting radio, much to the irritation of Eddie. In the scene that follows, Lila and Eddie have sex so violently it actually causes Eddie physical pain. Then the following morning she insists they hold hands during breakfast, by the end of which she spits the drinks through her nose and reveals she suffers from deviated septum . Upon their arrival at Espezanza Auberge Resorts, it comes to light that Lila's job is actually a volunteer position and that the purse snatcher was actually her ex-boyfriend. As Eddie realizes the mistake he has made, he meets Miranda , a vacationer from Mississippi there with her family. It's immediately obvious that Eddie and Miranda are a perfect match. With Lila stuck in their hotel room due to severe sunburn, Eddie devotes large amounts of his honeymoon time to Miranda. Eddie also connects with her family, except for her cousin ([[Danny McBride , who suspects Eddie of hiding something. To cover his long absences from his bride, Eddie makes up a story about a business with a major supplier to his store, who he is trying to butter up for 'better credit terms'. Eddie decides to break up with Lila. In the chaos that ensues, she and Miranda both abandon him. Eddie's passport is destroyed by Lila in the mayhem. He is forced to cross the U.S. border illegally with help provided from his friend Uncle Tito , but is repeatedly caught by border patrols while others escape by the hundreds. After an extensive effort to get into the country, he goes to Oxford, Mississippi only to find out that Miranda already married her previous boyfriend. He promises her aunt to leave Miranda alone, only to sneak into Miranda's house late at night. He wakes her up and talks to her without waking up her husband. Alas, her cousin breaks into the house with a baseball bat and beats Eddie up until Eddie's father makes his presence known too. Eddie agrees to leave if Miranda just says if she really loves her new husband. Miranda says yes. Eddie gives up on her although he doesn't know she looks at him from her balcony when he walks away. Eighteen months later, Eddie has moved to Mexico. Miranda comes there on vacation, informing him that she made a mistake, has split with her husband and wants to be with him. Eddie is very pleased, except he once again hides the fact that he has a new wife, Consuela , and he is thrust right back into the same situation.
