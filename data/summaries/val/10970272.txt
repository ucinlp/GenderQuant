An ancient Chinese scroll is stolen from a museum in Los Angeles and teenage Don Pringle  arrives on Catalina Island simultaneously. Although approximately half of the film involves swimsuit-clad adolescents dancing on yachts in several different dance montages, Pringle and his friends investigate the scroll's theft and discover that the parents of one of the boys is responsible â€” also while attempting to woo a mysteriously depressed young woman Katrina Corelli  from her vaguely threatening boyfriend Angelo . After wrestling the scroll away from Angelo and his cohorts, bent on more dangerous results , the boys secretly return the scroll to the museum to the relief of the repentant parents.
