Abel Plenkov , a man who suffers from multiple personality disorder and schizophrenia and whose alter ego is 'The Riverton Ripper' murders his pregnant wife and counselor Dr. Blake. When he dies later that night, his multiple personalities are transferred to the souls of seven children who were born prematurely that same night. 16 years later, Adam 'Bug' Hellerman  and six other children celebrate their 16th birthday. Throughout the day, 5 of the 7 children are brutally killed by the Riverton Ripper including : Jay , Penelope , Brandon , Brittany , and Jerome . Bug's adoptive mother  is also killed, as well as the police officer, Detective Paterson , who had been investigating the murders 16 years earlier. Bug's older sister Leah 'Fang' Hellerman  is wounded but survives. Bug finds out he is the son of the Ripper, Abel Plenkov. After the Ripper kills people throughout the Hellerman house, Bug's best friend Alex  crawls through the window and Bug realizes that the Ripper's soul transferred to Alex's body. Alex also reveals he murdered his abusive stepfather. After a brief struggle, Bug manages to stab Alex and free the Ripper's soul into Hell. Thinking he will be arrested  he walks out of the house and is instead celebrated as a hero after Leah tells the police exactly what happened. Although he doesn't feel like a hero, Bug decides to "fake it..." and act like a hero, just like Alex had taught him to act like a man.
