Dr. Phibes awakens in 1928, three years after the events of the previous movie. His primary goal is the awakening of his dead wife, Victoria. He finds that his house has been demolished, and that the papyrus scrolls he needs to find the Pharaoh's tomb, where the River of Life flows, have been stolen. With the source of the papyrus theft identified, he and his assistant, Vulnavia, leave for Egypt. Vulnavia's face displays no effects from the acid shower she received at the end of the previous film, although she is played by a different actress, Australian model Valli Kemp. The thieves die off as Inspectors Trout and Waverly chase Phibes across the world. The theiving party is led by the several-hundred-years-old Biederbeck , who wants to find the River of Life in order that he and his lover Diana  can live forever. Phibes' murders now have an Egyptian theme; one character is sand-blasted to death, another is stung to death by scorpions. At the climax, Beiderbeck sacrifices his life in order to save Diana. The film ends as Phibes rafts down the River of Life with Victoria, while singing "Over the Rainbow". It is left ambiguous whether Victoria is resurrected.
