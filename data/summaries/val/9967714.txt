The film tells of an ambitious business man  who wants to sell train 33, affectionately known as "Coraz√≥n de fuego," to a company in Hollywood. A group of elderly men known as "The Friends of the Rails" think that to do so would be to sell an important part of the country's history and so devise to steal the train. The group of hijackers is led by "El Professor"  and the train itself is driven by Pepe who says he learned how to do so during the Spanish civil war. The group is also accompanied by Dante Minetti , who suffers from Alzheimer's, and Guito, Pepe's neighbor/friend's nine year old great-nephew. The escapade takes the train all across the small country, exhibiting Uruguay's vibrant landscape and varied climate, also revealing many abandoned towns and train stops.
