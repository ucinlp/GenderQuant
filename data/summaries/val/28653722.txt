A dark fairytale combining the drama of modern horror with classic elements of Gothic imagery inspired by the German Expressionist films of the 1920s. A young artist, Lucy Snow, struggles bravely to cope with more than one grief; the plight of her seriously ill mother, and her own faltering talents as a painter. Her dreams become haunted by a shadowy figure, the mythical Travelling Artist. This lonely wanderer, itâ€™s whispered, has roamed the world for over a century in pursuit of his creative visions. Can such a man exist? And if he does, will his powers be able to rescue Lucy from sadness and what form will salvation take?
