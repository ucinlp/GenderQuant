The 44-years-old family man Frank Lange  has a proper job and lives with his wife Simone  and their children Lilly  and Mika  in a modern serial house when he learns he suffers with an inoperable brain tumour and has only but a short time left. Supported by his family he uses an iPod to keep daily records of his decline. Radiation therapy and chemical treatment take their toll on him. Eventually he grows too weak to leave the house and has hallucinations during which his tumour seems to appear as a vain actor in a late-night talk show hosted by Germany's established TV presenter Harald Schmidt. His children are increasingly overstrained and so is his wife Simone. The tumour deprives Frank from memory, orientational ability and even control of basic body functions. Fighting the pain with always stronger doses of morphium he loses his true personality and finally his speech. Having become a nursing case of the highest degree he dies at last in his home amidst his family. When actually everybody is lost for words, his daughter Lilly, an ambitious diver, utters: "I have to attend training".
