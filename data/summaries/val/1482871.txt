Set in early 20th century New England, the film is about a serial killer who is murdering disabled young women in the community. His next victim apparently is Helen; she is a mute girl working as a live-in companion for the wealthy, bedridden Mrs. Warren, who urges her to leave the house, as does Dr. Parry, who knows the reason for Helen's loss of speech and hopes to help her get her voice back. Rounding out the household are Mrs. Warren's son and stepson, her verbally-abused nurse, a secretary, a handyman and his wife, a housekeeper with a taste for brandy.
