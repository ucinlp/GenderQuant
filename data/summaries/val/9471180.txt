Janusz marries Kasia. The father of the bride, Wieslaw Wojnar, gives Janusz a brand-new-looking Audi. Wojnar has to pay several people off so that the wedding celebration can proceed smoothly. This includes securing a plot of land from his father-in-law, who is spending a lot of time in the men's room. One of Kasia's old lovers shows up, but he's not interested in getting money out of Wojnar, as the others are.
