Solo  is an android designed as a military killing machine. He is sent to Central America by General Haynes  to battle guerrilla insurgents, but a flaw develops in his programming and he develops a conscience and compassion. His developers try to take him back for deprogramming, but he flees to the jungle in a helicopter. His main energy supply was damaged during the first mission, forcing him to switch to his much less powerful secondary power. He joins a small village community that is under constant threat from guerilla attackers, and he protects them in exchange for use of their electric generator . There he learns to 'bluff' which eventually saves Solo's life. A more powerful version of the android  is developed and is sent into the jungle to destroy him.
