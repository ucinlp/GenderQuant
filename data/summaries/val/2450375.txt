Maggie Sheridan , a washed-up blues vocalist from the 1960s who had long since stopped performing, had settled into a comfortable life on the Dublin estate of the father of her childhood friend, Sir Charles Stafford . When Sir Charles is murdered in what appears to be a bungled robbery , Maggie is drawn into the world of illegal art trade in an effort to solve the mystery and avenge her friend's murder, donning the persona of Polish Countess Magdelena Kreschinska√°. The story centers around Judith Beheading Holofernes, the masterwork of Artemisia Gentileschi, who was a 17th century female Italian painter who survived a rape. The painting fictionally travels to Dublin and New York City, and Gentileschi's tragic story eventually figures into the plot. There are other visual references to paintings in the film.
