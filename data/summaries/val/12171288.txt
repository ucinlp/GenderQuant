Set in 1910, it is based on the 1923 London and Broadway hit play by Leon Gordon, which was in turn adapted from the novel Hell's Playground by Ida Vera Simonton. The play had already been made into a British part-talkie with Maurice Evans in 1929. The story centers around two white colonizers who are both interested in Tondelayo, a half Egyptian, half Arab native. In the original play, the character Tondelayo was black, but her ethnic background was changed for the movie to avoid violating the production codeThomas F. Brady.

The 1942 film, unlike the play, begins in what was then the present day, and uses a flashback technique.
