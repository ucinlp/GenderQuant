Sophie's parents own a cottage in the country and invited the four girls over for a week-end to celebrate their last few days all together as teenagers. As soon as Sophie's parents leave the girls for the week-end, the girls come up with the idea of a party. With that in mind, two of them, Sophie and Manon  go hitchhiking for a ride to the store to buy beer. A man named Thibodeau picks them up in his car.

But as hard as they try, nothing can be forgotten, especially not when they discover that Thibodeau is said to be released from prison. A story for every person that has been scarred in the past!
