His comic timing was excellent and his acting flawless. He truly does carry this film entirely with his bravura performance & Amjad Khan was praised for his portrayal of a doting friend. The film is still appealing thirty odd years later, primarily due to Amitabh and the late Amjad Khan. This movie also marks a breakthrough in the musical career of Rajesh Roshan... An eminent composer for Hindi Movies - primarily collaborating on projects with his brother Rakesh Roshan & nephew - Superstar Hrithik Roshan.
