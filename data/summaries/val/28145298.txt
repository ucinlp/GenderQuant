Thirteen years after the original series, Timmy Turner has grown into a twenty-three-year-old man, but through maintaining a lifestyle considered immature for someone of his age he has managed to keep his fairy godparents. However, Timmy's refusal to mature greatly irritates his parents, who seem desperate to encourage him to finally leave home, and Jorgen von Strangle, who is constantly scheming up plans that will entice Timmy into giving up his fairies. However, one day Timmy winds up reuniting with a girl from his childhood named Tootie who once possessed an infatuation on him and sees that she has grown into a beautiful activist. Soon, Timmy starts to fall in love with Tootie and begins to date her, much to the chagrin of his fairy godparents, Cosmo and Wanda, who continuously scheme to repel Tootie. Meanwhile, Timmy's schoolteacher , Denzel Crocker, teams up with an oil tycoon by the name of Hugh Magnate in order to kidnap Timmy's fairies and use their magic for their own delights. At the same time, a romantic relationship develops between Tootie and Timmy, who is torn between keeping his fairies and dating Tootie. However, one day Magnate deceives and kidnaps Tootie while Crocker captures Cosmo, Wanda, and their baby son Poof, imprisoning them in a device programmed to use their magic to grant anybody's wishes. After betraying Crocker, Magnate tortures the fairies by fooling around with the wish-granting invention, which electrocutes them each time somebody makes a wish, but fortunately soon Timmy comes to the rescue of both the fairies and Tootie  and battles with both his enemy and the toy robot that Magnate used the fairies' magic to anthropomorphize, successfully freeing Tootie. However, now Timmy is forced to give up his fairy godparents, who vanish forever. Although Timmy is saddened deeply by the departure of Cosmo, Wanda, and Poof, he is happy to be free to latch on to more mature behaviors as he longed to do, but soon learns from Jorgen von Strangle that because of his courage a new law was passed in Fairy World that will now permit him to keep his fairy godparents forever as long as he makes only charitable wishes. Because of this, Tootie and Timmy plan to start a charity organization in which they will make wishes that will mend all of the world's problems or travesties, flying away in a magical van.
