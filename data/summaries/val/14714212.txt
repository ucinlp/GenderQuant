Cameraman Johnny and mercenary Major Bull Weed escape from a Japanese jail with help from the latterâ€™s girlfriend Fifi. They steal a plane and land at a Flying Tiger base in Mandalay. Instead of joining the Tigers, Johnny makes a deal with Bull and Fifi to obtain a camera for him, offering them half-interest in whatever he films. Johnny tries to strike up a romance with Haoli, a Chinese woman. She initially rejects him, but later warns him that Bull and Fifi are Japanese agents.Harrison's Reports film review; December 5, 1942, page 196.
