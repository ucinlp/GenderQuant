Steve Nichols is a struggling actor in New York City who takes the job posing as comic-book hero Captain Avenger at comics stores and conventions. He finds his life unexpectedly complicated when he stops a robbery while wearing the costume of Captain Avenger. The costume is for a film he is hired to promote, but Nichols decides to continue being a superhero and discovers that the superhero life is more complex than he initially thought. Nichols is hired by the mayor's staff, who hope that Captain Avenger's tie-in will help the mayor win an upcoming election. The plan is discovered and revealed by the media, and Captain Avenger finds himself on the outs with the public. Prodded by his girlfriend Jolene to be himself and not rely on a costume and mask to gain adulation, Nichols becomes a bonafide hero when he rescues a young child from a fire at an apartment building.
