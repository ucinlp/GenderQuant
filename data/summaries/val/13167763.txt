Glauco, an industrial designer, returns home from work. His wife is in bed with a headache but has left him dinner, which has become cold. He is dissatisfied with the food and begins preparing himself a gourmet meal. While collecting ingredients he discovers an old revolver wrapped in a 1934 newspaper with the headline "Dillinger is dead" and an account of the famous American gangster's death. Glauco cleans and restores the gun, then paints it red with white polka dots. He also eats his meal, watches some television and film, listens to music and seduces their maid. With the gun he enacts suicide a number of times. At dawn he shoots his wife thrice in the head. Then he drives to the seaside where he gets a job as a chef on a yacht bound for Tahiti.
