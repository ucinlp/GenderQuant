Marjorie Turner has been married for eight years and is tired of her husband Harry's neglect and his snooty relatives, most of them doctors. One day her sister, Jeanine, urges her to break out of her rut and have a fling. At a grocery store, Marjorie allows herself to be picked up for a quick sexual tryst. Unfortunately, her lover dies during the act. Even more unfortunately, the dead man turns out to be Harry's long-absent brother. Complications ensue, some of them involving a blinds salesman -- not a blind one, but a man who sells vertical blinds -- named Meany who feels responsible for the man's death, as well as Meany's brother, a police officer investigating the case.
