Michael Richards is a rapist and murderer, but in his mind he’s a victim out to get retribution against the women who have wronged him. The film uses the sequence approach and follows each of the five female leads as opposed to a time-line. The film shifts back and forth to follow the point of view of each of the women as they are stalked and haunted by the blood hunger psychopath. Each sequence shows the women engage in graphic drug use and sex, that both come off very real to the naked eye, and reveals a little bit more of the story before each woman is ultimately “judged” by Michael.Plot Synopsis by Jason Buchanan AllRovi.comAmazon.com movie page
