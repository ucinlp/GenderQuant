Strawberry rids Strawberryland of a strange, horrible smelling purple cloud with the help of her new friends, the Berry Princess and her helpers, the Berrykins. "Strawberry Shortcake Meets The Berrykins" featured the first  animated appearance of new friend Banana Twirl, and the Berry Princess, mystical guardian of the sprite-like Berrykins. Strawberry's friends Blueberry Muffin, Raspberry Tart, Lemon Meringue and Lime Chiffon were all featured in this special, but were not merchandised as part of 1985's "Berrykins" line of Dolls by Kenner. Furthermore, Mint Tulip, who WAS produced as a "Berrykins" Doll, did NOT appear in this special.
