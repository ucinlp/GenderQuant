Through a sequence in the film we learn that the first of Petrovic, Savo, came to Sweden and that his call came to Peter and Braco. Initially, their work provided the Savo and they paid him a commission, of course, reduced, however, because the brothers, but as the years passed, each started their work. Peter Mara opened the pizzeria, bakery Braco, while Savo left the shady dealings and often borrowed money from Peter to bring back the debts.
