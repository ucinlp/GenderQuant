While traveling in London, Jeffrey Buckenham , a Canadian Second World War veteran, sees Sir Mark Sebastian Loddon  on television leading a tour of his grand family home. Buckenham was held in a German POW camp with Loddon, and while watching him, becomes convinced that he is in fact another former POW, Frank Wellney, an actor . Buckenham publicly announces his suspicion that Wellney murdered Loddon during an escape from the POW camp, and has taken the young nobleman's place. Loddon sues Buckenham for libel, but his mind is still battered by some terrible incident that occurred during his escape fifteen years before, and in time even his loyal wife  begins to doubt him.
