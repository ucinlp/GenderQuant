Several years after the events of 1990: The Bronx Warriors and Trash , former leader of the Riders gang is now a cynical loner, remaining in the impoverished, lawless wasteland of the Bronx and trading in stolen ammunition. The General Construction  Corporation, led by President Clark , wish to tear down the Bronx to turn it into “the city of the future”. To do this they need to clear the current population from the area and have employed expelled prison warden Floyd Wangler  and a private squad of Disinfestors to burn, shoot and gas those that will not leave willingly. While the bums, vagrants and elderly are easy prey, the warrior gangs of the Bronx will not go quietly and a rebel army of all surviving Bronx gangs led by Dablone  is holed up underground. When Trash’s parents are burned alive by Disinfestors he begins to take revenge by leading ruthless guerrilla attacks on the clean up squads which in turn leads to the GC Corporation and Floyd Wangler trying ever nastier means of subverting the rebellion . Trash, Dablone and a crusading reporter named Moon Gray  then team up with psychotic mercenary Strike  and his equally crazy son  to kidnap President Clark and put the Bronx back in the hands of the gangs.
