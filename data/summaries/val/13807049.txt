Tariq Ali , a Muslim police commander of Scotland Yard, is asked to hunt down suspected suicide-bombers against the backdrop of the 7 July bombings in London. Ali's task becomes more complicated as an innocent Muslim is killed by armed police on the Underground. Ali, a Lahore-born British citizen married to an English woman with two children, is himself distrusted by his colleagues, despite his long service in the Metropolitan Police.
