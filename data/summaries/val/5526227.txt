The films opens with a series of unsuccessful assassination attempts by an unknown organisation with their target being Melvin Byrd . Byrd is a janitor in a NASA laboratory headed by Major General Smithburn  with his security officer the bumbling Lt. Porter  who is captured and impersonated by an enemy double from the same organisation attempting to kill Byrd. The head scientist Professor Waid  has employed Byrd due to his excellent janitorial skills as Waid blames American space program failures on dust that caused disasters. Byrd parodies the Ajax "stronger than dirt" white knight commercial when cleaning the base. Waid's secret project is developing an ionisation process initially to be tested on a chimpanzee  that would make the subject capable of anti-gravity with a side effect that not only gives him the ability to fly, but makes him "the most attractive man" on earth! When General Smithburn leads a Congressional delegation who are in Florida due to European junkets being cancelled, Byrd hides in the ionisation machine leading him to be ionised. In addition to the being unable to stay in the ground Byrd must fight off the attentions of a Congresswoman  and Waid's daughter Claudine  as well as the assassins.
