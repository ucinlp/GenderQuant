The film revolves around the fate of five people - singer Carolyn Crosson, her boyfriend Gilbert London, child actress Sally Shine ,Abigail Gregory: "I.... I couldn't sing. And I couldn't dance." Sally says that the whole party was a surprise birthday for her older sister. Abby, Buzzy, Jill, Q and Sally then board the service elevator, catching up with the others. Anna manages to escape from an emergency escape hatch, rejoining Buzzy and the others in their elevator. The lightning strikes again, and both groups plunge downward. Sally forgives her sister, and they both turn into a shower of gold dust, breaking the curse and slowing both elevators to a stop. The groups are saved, and they all go to the Tip-Top Club on the top floor, restored to its former glory. One by one, the ghosts then ascend to Heaven, along with the other partygoers. Abigail, young once more, appears, meeting up once more with her sister, who gives her a surprise birthday present, a bracelet. The Gregory sisters then join hands and vanish into the night, breaking the curse on the hotel. With the spell broken, the Tower is re-opened, with Q taking charge. Cha-Ching.
