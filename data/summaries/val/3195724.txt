The film begins with the following disclaimer:  The following dramatization includes time compression and composite and fictionalized characters and incidents.  In 1980, ABC development executive Vince Peterson ([[John Terry  meets with producer Aaron Spelling , looking for a series featuring &#34;greed and manipulation and sex and power and vanity&#34; to battle against CBS&#39; hit nighttime serial Dallas and make it &#34;look like Sesame Street.&#34; Writers Richard and Esther Shapiro  are already developing their own modern take on I, Claudius, and Dynasty is conceived. From the beginning, Esther&#39;s intent to explore &#34;real social issues&#34; and not have the show be an &#34;inane soap with beautiful people and beautiful clothes&#34; clashes with the network and advertisers&#39; squeamishness with homosexual character Steven, &#34;the first openly gay character on a prime time drama series.&#34; John Forsythe  — the voice of Charlie's Angels{{&#39;}} Charlie — and Linda Evans  are cast as Blake and Krystle Carrington. With the new series at #40 in the ratings, ABC pushes for Steven to be &#34;cured,&#34; and Richard conceives a female J. R. Ewing: Blake&#39;s bitter ex-wife Alexis. Soon Dynasty welcomes Heather Locklear  as sexpot Sammy Jo, and Joan Collins  as villainess Alexis. Wanting to give the fans a proper ending, Esther, Richard and Aaron approach ABC about a reunion movie. The network is reluctant, but Aaron&#39;s influence prevails. The cast happily return at reduced salaries; when asked if she wants a stunt double for Alexis&#39; final catfight with Krystle, Joan quips, &#34;What the hell — for a few shots I&#39;d like to get in this time!&#34; All depart smiling, knowing they have made history.
