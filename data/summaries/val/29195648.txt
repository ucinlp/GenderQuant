Paul Gregory  is a blind but very successful pop music composer, married to the beautiful Anne . Anne is having a secret affair with struggling artist Rickie Seldon , and persuades Paul to commission Rickie to paint her portrait as a pretext to enable them to spend time together. Paul agrees, but after a recording session with Ronnie Carroll he is told by his business partner Mike Williams  that Anne and Rickie have been seen about town together in circumstances which leave no doubt that they are more than friends. Paul knows that Mike has always disliked Anne and suspects he may be trouble-causing, but is finally persuaded of the validity of his allegations. Paul makes it clear to Anne that he has found out about the affair and threatens to leave her. Fearing her meal-ticket is about to disappear, she tells Rickie that they will have to arrange an "accident" to Paul by getting him drunk and pushing him off the balcony of their home. If Rickie does not agree, she suggests, their affair must end. The plan is attempted, but is botched by Rickie, whose heart is not really in it. After a struggle, he and Paul start to talk and Paul tells him to open his eyes to Anne's true nature, suggesting that she may well be double-crossing him too. Rickie, having no personal antipathy towards Paul, comes to the conclusion that he may be right. The pair end up forming an unlikely alliance, unknown to Anne, to try to entrap her into revealing her true motives. Between them they manage to set her up, and discover that the serious romance is between Anne and Mike, who have managed to hide it for so long by the public pretence of mutual antagonism and loathing. In fact the whole scheme had been concocted with Rickie in mind as a convenient fall-guy, there to take the rap if suspicions were aroused about Paul's death. Paul and Rickie then set about meting out appropriate justice on the perfidious pair.
