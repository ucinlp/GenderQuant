Clay and Marjorie, an estranged married couple, take a vacation together while Clay recuperates from a serious auto accident. They end up in a sleepy little town which seems to be normal, except at night when the townspeople  turn into zombies, file into trucks and head out of town. They always return by morning, and no one has any memories of the night before. Only Clay is unaffected, and no one believes his story.
