Los Angeles scriptwriter David Sumner  and his wife, TV actress Amy Sumner , move to Blackwater, Mississippi, where Amy grew up, to rebuild Amy's recently deceased father's house, and so that David can finish a script. David meets Amy's ex-boyfriend Charlie Venner  and his friends Norman , Chris  and Bic , whom he hires to fix the barn's roof, which was recently badly damaged by a hurricane. David also meets former football coach Tom Heddon , whose 15-year-old daughter Janice  is attracted to a local mentally handicapped man, Jeremy Niles , who lives with his brother Daniel . Heddon often bullies Jeremy, who may have committed a crime in the past, and believes Jeremy is stalking his daughter. Charlie and his friends begin taunting David, who is initially condescending to their customs. The taunting escalates into harassment as they make crude remarks towards Amy and play loud music to annoy David and prevent him from working on his screenplay. They break into the house and strangle the couple's cat while they are at a social gathering. David is hesitant to confront the men about the cat's death without evidence of their involvement, so Amy does it. Shortly thereafter, while David is away hunting with the men, Charlie forces his way into the house and overpowers Amy, raping her on the couch as she tries to fight him off. While she is recovering, Norman appears and violently rapes her across the back of the couch while Charlie watches from the other side of the room. David returns, having been abandoned in the woods by the men, but Amy doesn't tell him about the rape. David fires the men the following day. At Amy's insistence, they go to a local football game, where Amy and Charlie meet. Meanwhile, Janice takes Jeremy to an empty locker area and attempts to give him oral sex. Heddon notices her absence and begins looking for her. Jeremy, scared of Heddon, puts his hand over Janice's mouth to silence her, accidentally smothering her to death. He runs away just as Heddon informs Charlie and his friends of Janice's disappearance and deduces that Jeremy has done something to her. Amy becomes uncomfortable with Charlie and asks David to take her home. On the way, she tells him she wants to return to Los Angeles, surprising him and causing him to accidentally run over Jeremy. David and Amy take him to their home and call Sheriff John Burke . Heddon finds out and goes to David and Amy's house with Charlie, Norman, Chris and Bic. Heddon confronts David, but David says he will only turn Jeremy over to the state authorities. Frustrated, Heddon kills the Sheriff at the front door as David watches through the peephole, and Heddon attempts to enter the house. David takes Amy and Jeremy upstairs to the bedroom and prepares to fight off the men. Chris attempts to break into the house through a window, so David nails his hand to the wall with a nail gun, then tells him he hopes the glass slits his throat. When Heddon tries to follow, David burns his face with boiling vegetable oil. Heddon and Charlie decide to ram one of the house's walls with Charlie's pick-up truck. They succeed, but Charlie is momentarily knocked unconscious. Meanwhile, David overpowers Heddon, causing Heddon to accidentally shoot his own foot. David then takes the opportunity to shoot Heddon in the chest, killing him. He then beats Bic to death with a fireplace poker. Upstairs, Amy and Jeremy are attacked by Norman who has climbed through a window with a ladder. Norman is preparing to rape Amy again when David and Charlie appear. Charlie and Norman draw on each other when Norman threatens to kill Amy. Focusing on each other, they don't see Amy retrieve a shotgun. She shoots Norman to death. David and Charlie fight, and Charlie overpowers David downstairs. As Charlie puts his pistol to David's forehead, Amy aims the shotgun at Charlie. Charlie reminds Amy that the gun is empty, but the distraction gives David the opportunity to kill him by ensnaring his head with a bear trap. David and Amy watch as Charlie is strangled by the trap and dies on the floor. As sirens approach, David walks outside and looks at the burning barn, announcing that he "got them all".
