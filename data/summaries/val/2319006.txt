Patricia Porker  is a shy New Jersey high school girl whose life is changed forever when she is bitten by a genetically-engineered spider and turns into a wall-climbing beauty with superhuman strength. Calling herself SpiderBabe, she uses her newfound powers to enter a wrestling contest and win enough money to move out of her Uncle Flem and Aunt Maybe's home and into her own apartment with Lisa Knox . However, a robber interferes and inspires Patricia to fight crime in New York City. Meanwhile, Lisa's ambitious sister, Lucinda Knox , uses the same genetic engineering techniques that Patricia's science teacher, Dr. Dowell , had used on a spider on herself, and gains a villainous alter-ego, the sexy and evil genius Femtilian. Like Norman Osborn  in the original movie which this one spoofs, Femtilian sets out on a quest for world domination which brings her into conflict with the heroic SpiderBabe.
