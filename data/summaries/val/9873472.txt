The story begins with the Cassini Saturn space craft releasing the Huygens Titan probe. We then transition to earth, where a 12-year-old girl, Jeana , places a sun filter over a telescope to view sun spots. She asks her mentor, a Professor "Why is the Sun so bright?" This leads the professor to launch into a scientific explanation about fusion. The little girl laughs, having played this trick on her mentor many times, she says "No I meant bright, bright like happy. In most drawings the sun has a big smile. Is he good, like the man in the moon." Knowing this means she wants a story, the mentor begins to spin a tale, but as a mentor, this one, while entertaining, is also educational.<ref name | title  inbaseline website | date  http://www.inbaseline.com/project.aspx?project_id2008-11-01 }}  As he speaks, we transition to the Sun, and watching a Sun Spot spin into view, we dive into and pass through the chromosphere, and head toward the center. The mentor lays down the basis of our story as we travel through the sun. He explains that the "man in the sun is called the Core " and spins a story how he is good and that his children "photons" are sent out to chase away the darkness, and bring life, warmth, and knowledge to Earth. He adds that the only being who does not like the Core is a creature called the "Void"  who is an ancient, malevolent, being who existed before the Big Bang, and who sits at the edge of the solar system, scheming to stop the Core. We cut to the Kuiper Belt where a large space battle rages between two fleets â€“ one composed of protons, and the opposing fleet of anti-protons. A character we call "The Ranger , who is a neutrino scout, makes it through the battle lines and heads to the sun. David's journey takes him through the solar system, to an exploration of the moons of Saturn. Eventually he finds Milton , an older photon character who is mining for free quarks. Milton teaches David introductory material about electrons, protons, quarks, etc. The two evade the evil/comical forces of the Void, until they get captured by the "Dark Side of the Moon". He gets inside the Cassini craft and encounters the ship's computer, GAL 2000 , who, in the course of determining the danger, teaches David about spectra, the mission of the space craft, different radiation bands used for remote sensing, etc. In the end, they save the antenna of the ship from a beam of anti-matter sent by the Void. They do this with the help of Jammer. David discovers that he is the Space Core Commander . He leads the transmission back to Earth, and through a system of antennas, is processed, and as Jeana accesses the Web page of JPL, he flies through the screen and enters Jeana's eye.
