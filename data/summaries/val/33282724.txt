The first half of the film has real-life AV director and company executive Shungo Kaji reminiscing about his days as a film student at the Nikkatsu studio, surreptitiously watching the filming of the studio's Roman Porno series and then discoursing on the mechanics and problems of making and producing adult videos. The second half is a fictional depiction of the discovery and grooming by Kaji of a young AV starlet Saki .
