The boys &mdash; Brad, Frank and Kevin &mdash; go from their bedroom suburb of Middletown to the city, with money  with hopes to see a naked woman. They find a bemused hooker named "V" that accepts showing her breasts for the amount. However when they head back home, their bikes have been stolen. They're now broke, and stuck in the city. Back in her apartment V speaks with a male friend Cash and fellow hooker Betty. Bag-man Cash has been skimming money that he sends to his mob boss Waltzer who in turn steals from his own boss, Jerry. After the conversation he leaves the apartment and V notices the boys across the street cowering from the rain and takes his car to give them a ride home. After arriving at Frank's house the car breaks down. With no other option, V accepts his offer to stay in his tree house. Tom, his father, is a little surprised to find her there, but offers to repair the car in a few days when he is more free from his science classes at school. Frank tells Tom that she is a math tutor and that she's giving lessons to his friend Brad. He doesn't realize she is staying in the tree house. Frank does his best to accommodate her and begins to romanticize her, hoping to get widowed Tom to become attracted to her. In conversations with her, he tells her Tom is accepting of her 'job', meaning the false tutoring cover-up, but she thinks he means her prostitution. This innocent deception leads to several misconceptions by both of them. V learns through the TV that Cash has been murdered by his mob boss Waltzer, and phones Betty only to discover that Waltzer is now looking for her - Cash told him that she stole the money from him. She realizes that he is overhearing the conversation and hangs up. With the car still broken down, she gets Tom's old bike from the garage and rushes to find him so that he can repair it. He is on a field trip to the town's wetlands, a piece of undeveloped natural land that he is attempting to save from development. He is unable to repair the car any sooner but V realizes that she is probably safer there in Middletown, since Waltzer doesn't know where she is. Meanwhile at school, Frank flunks a biology test about sex education, and must give the class an oral presentation. He decides to use V as a mannequin, and through a ruse manages to distract his teacher long enough to draw a relatively accurate female reproductive system on her skin-colored suit. This leads to much comic gossip among the adults, and soon enough, she and Tom find out the truth about her vocation. He is angry, confused, and hurt and turns to a box of memorabilia that was his wife's before she died. As both go through the things inside the box they start to heal their relationship and V reveals that her real name is Eve. She thought the name Eve was too biblical so she removed the “e”s. Meanwhile, Kevin's father learns the truth about her as well, and in an attempt to purchase her services, unwittingly calls her phone number. Waltzer learns from Betty about the trip to Middletown, thus finding out where V is hiding. Tom and V begin a relationship, attending a school dance, and enjoying a night on the town. Waltzer shows up to spoil their fun, and a chase scene ensues, with him finally being eliminated. Anxious about her status, and afraid to return to her old job, V goes to his boss and relates how he has been cheating him, and asks to be 'forgotten' by them - the older crime boss succumbs to her charms and tells her he'll take care of things, and she doesn't need to be afraid any more. Tom and V find the stolen money in Cash's car, , and everybody lives happily ever after.
