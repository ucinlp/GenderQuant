Speedy Gonzales, "the fastest mouse in all Mexico", is living in the "fine hacienda of José Álvaro Meléndez" in an unnamed "big city" in Mexico where fellow resident Sylvester the Cat  is "the most pooped cat in all Mexico" from his futile attempts to catch Speedy. The cat is shown trying pep pills to get the energy needed to catch the mouse, to no effect. Their pursuit is interrupted when Speedy's country cousin, Slowpoke Rodriguez, knocks on the door. Taller, thinner, and slower talking than Speedy, Slowpoke arrives carrying a bindle stick and singing "La Cucaracha". The cat, seeing easier prey, lets Slowpoke into the hacienda where he is quickly rescued by Speedy. Complaining of hunger, Slowpoke sets out for the kitchen to get food only to be rescued again by Speedy. Speedy successfully raids the kitchen for cheese but Slowpoke complains that his cousin forgot the Tabasco sauce. During this second raid, the cat paints the floor with glue and actually catches Speedy but winds up swallowing the hot sauce, not the mouse, and Speedy escapes. After a very large meal, Slowpoke announces that he's ready for dessert. An incredulous Speedy makes another raid on the pantry where the cat has put up a wire mesh to stop the mice. Speedy runs right through the large holes with Sylvero right behind, stretching the mesh but passing through apparently unharmed. As the chase continues, the cat falls to pieces one cube at a time. That night, as Slowpoke and Speedy go to sleep in bunk beds made from match boxes, Slowpoke protests that he's still hungry and gets up to stage his own kitchen raid over Speedy's objections. Slowpoke reassures him, "maybe Slowpoke is pretty slow downstairs in the feet, but he is pretty fast upstairs in the cabeza." The cat does swiftly capture Slowpoke but the mouse instantly mesmerizes the cat, making him an unwilling servant to bring them food and cool them with a fan.
