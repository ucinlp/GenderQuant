The movie opens with a young boy setting fire to newspapers in the basement. His name is Mikey and he has a younger sister, Beth, whom he blames for the fire when his mother admonishes Mikey. When Mikey is disciplined by his foster mother for starting the fire, he responds by causing Beth to drown in the pool, electrocuting his foster mother while she is in the bath, and killing his foster father with a baseball bat. Mikey avoids suspicion because he is only nine and he tells the police that an intruder killed the family. Detective Reynolds is assigned to the case and he does not suspect Mikey. A psychiatrist recommends that Mikey get fostered as soon as possible. His foster mother's sister is put forward as a prospective foster carer, but she does not want anything to do with Mikey. She states that he was adopted and that it was suspected that he was abused by members of his family. She does not present as somebody who is overly interested in taking care of a young child. He is then sent to a new family, Neil and Rachel Trenton, who do not know anything about Mikey's past. Mikey presents himself as an amiable and loving child. For example, when he first meets his foster parents he asks, 'Are you going to be my new mommy and daddy?' At first, he does not behave as if he is disturbed and he exhibits caring behaviour towards his new mother's fish. He also manifests behaviour which is not out of the ordinary in his desire to succeed in a game which his class at school plays. Mikey then falls in love with his best friend's older sister, Jessie. She, however, is not interested in him as she is 15 years older than Mikey and is dating a young man named David. In an attempt to make Jessie love him, he electrocutes David while he is in a jacuzzi. After this fails, Mikey kills his foster father, his foster mother, and his teacher with a slingshot and ball bearings, the school's principal and  Jessie. To avoid being blamed, Mikey fakes his own death using a skeleton of a boy the same age as him. The skeleton was located in one of Mikey's classrooms at school. Jessie is told by the authorities that Mikey is dead. By the end of the movie, Mikey goes under the name Josh and is adopted by another family.
