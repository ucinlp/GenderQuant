Yau became the proprietor and head chef of a successful restaurant/cafe since her mother died six months ago. Yau cooks according to the large collection of recipes her mother, who had tremendous talent as a culinary artist but never found success in the restaurant scene due to sexism, created over the years, but has no confidence in herself as a chef. When she visits Japan with her assistant Guo at the invitation of an Iron Chef style cooking show, she has a chance run-in with an old boyfriend, Chuen. Over the next weeks back in HongKong, Yau struggles with resurgent feelings for Chuen even as she discovers that one of her best friends has started seeing him. In the mean time, her steadfast supporter and assistant for the last three years, Guo, pushes her to be more bold in her art and experiment. Love and food intersects with surprising twists as she finally decides to leave the past behind and compete in the cooking challenge. In the end, love is the secret ingredient.
