Wallace  and Wilder Foudroyant  are brothers and pyrokinetics. Ever since a childhood tragedy where they accidentally killed a bum sleeping in a friend's "secret clubhouse," they've kept their firestarting abilities a secret. Now that they're grown up and estranged, Wallace  wants to debut his talents on The David Letterman Show. Wilder has a dull job in a minuscule Kwik Foto booth at a dying mall and is a volunteer fireman. When Wallace brings the carnival to Wilder's Florida hometown, the tension between the brothers over Wilder's oversexed wife, Vida , explodes. Unable to convince Wilder to forgo his Bingo-calling on her first day of freedom after a year of house arrest for inadvertent arson, Vida goes off with Wally. They share a kiss at a miniature golf course which bursts into the flames of their passion. Returning home after his fire unit has extinguished the flames at the golf course, Wilder discovers Vida and Wally about to make love on the roof of the house trailer. Wally and Wilder fight it out, with Wally setting the trailer ablaze. All three are jailed, but Wally and Vida are bailed out by Wally's friend and carnival partner, Rex . In a deep slump, Wilder goes back to the Kwik Foto  while Vida stays at the firehouse. Wally goads him into fighting for Vida, and their climactic fight sets half the carnival's rides ablaze. The denouement shows Vida and Wilder  watching Wallace on a successful Letterman reappearance as Dr. Napalm.
