In a small village in Lahat, South Sumatra, an 18-year-old boy named Dapunta  is almost ready to graduate from senior high school; he is known as the Wind Chaser locally because of his running capabilities. He and his mother Dakunta  want him to go to university, but his father&nbsp;– the leader of a gang of bandits&nbsp;– refuses to allow it. Dapunta decides to go to university no matter what. His crush Nyimas  and teacher Damar  help him, motivating him to practice his running so that he can use athletics to enter the university of his choice. However, his classmate Yusuf &nbsp;– who has similar running abilities&nbsp;– is also training; he sabotages some of Dapunta's practice sessions. Meanwhile, the headmaster attempts to limit Dapunta's training out of spite for his father. A month later, Damar's friend Ferdy , a trainer, comes to Lahat looking for talent to participate in the upcoming Southeast Asian Games . He takes on Dapunta and further trains him. After Dapunta is able to represent his country at the SEA Games in Palembang, his father relents and allows Dapunta to follow his dreams.
