Sorrowful Jones  is a gloomy, cantankerous bookie circa 1934, who is confronted by a gambler who cannot pay a $10 debt. He ultimately gives his 6-year-old daughter  to Sorrowful's gangster-run gambling operation as a "marker"  for a bet. When the desperate gambler loses his bet and commits suicide, the gangsters are left with the "Kid" on their hands. Sorrowful's nervous assistant, Regret , is concerned about the legalities of this, particularly the kidnapping statutes. In the interim, a crime boss named Blackie  coerces his longtime rival Sorrowful into financing a new gambling joint. The casino is opened in the stately home of Blackie's girlfriend, widowed Amanda Worthington , who needs money to buy back her family property. Amanda is also counting on a racehorse of hers called Sir Galahad to ride to her rescue. While the Kid's personal needs inconvenience Sorrowful, a father-daughter relationship develops between them and they become inseparable. Amanda also takes a liking to the Kid, and reluctantly, the icy Sorrowful, who eventually comes to love her as wellâ€”much to Blackie's chagrin.
