The story is about a young man “Tony”, a 25 year old agronomy graduate, who works in a coffee shop. He has a stunning girlfriend “Valerie” who works as a model. Carine, a 24 year old actress and scenarist, is engaged to “Jean-Pierre” who works in a bank. “Tony” and “Carine” are both complete strangers until they meet for the first time in a park, in a rather unusual situation. A close friendship fires up between them while her engagement falls apart. On the surface, the story is direct and funny. However, this simplicity combined with the two main characters “Tony” and “Carine” add a distinct freshness and originality to the film. “Amour d’Enfants” describes the metamorphosis of a great friendship into an exceptional love.amour d'enfants - website
