Detective Sgt. Walter Brown  is assigned to protect a mob boss's widow, Mrs. Frankie Neall , as she rides a train from Chicago to Los Angeles to testify before a grand jury. Brown, on the way to meet her, expresses his contempt for Mrs. Neall to his longtime partner and friend Gus Forbes : "She's the sixty cent special. Cheap. Flashy. Strictly poison under the gravy." As the detectives and Mrs. Neall leave her apartment, they are waylaid by a mob assassin named Densel. Forbes is shot to death, and the gunman escapes. At the train station, Brown discovers that he has been followed by gangsters Joseph Kemp  and the genteel Vincent Yost , who unsuccessfully tries to bribe him. Brown's relationship with Mrs. Neall is caustic. She is cynical and flashy, constantly flirting with him while doubting his integrity and commitment to protecting her. Brown makes friends with an attractive passenger he meets by chance, Ann Sinclair , and her too-observant young son Tommy . However, Kemp spots them together and thinks that Sinclair is the target. When he confronts Kemp and gets into a fight with him, Brown learns of the mistake. He turns Kemp over to overweight railroad agent Sam Jennings  and hurries to warn Mrs. Sinclair. However, she has a surprise for him - she is really Mrs. Neall. The other woman is a decoy named Sarah Meggs. Meanwhile, Jennings is knocked out by Kemp's more-dangerous associate Densel , the assassin who killed Brown's partner, and Kemp is freed. The gangsters enter Brown's compartment and kill Meggs. Then Densel goes for Mrs. Neall. He is cornered in a locked compartment with her, with Brown outside. Brown uses the reflection from the window of a train on the next track to shoot Densel through the door, then enters the compartment and finishes him off. Kemp jumps off the stopped train, but is quickly arrested.
