Satyam and Dharmaiah are friends and favorite students of Bhavani Prasad. Satyam is son of Bhushaiah, a rich landlord. Dharmaiah is son of Kotaiah, a laborer. The story starts with Bhavani Prasad teaching his students about the need of unity among people of all castes and creeds and the song "Gunna Mamidi Komma Meedha" that epitomizes his teachings and friendship. Nagaraju, unruly kid, is son of Papaiah, village president. Animosity between land lord politicians Papaiah and Bhushaiah reflects in the lives of their children. Nagaraju challenges Satyam about ability to buy tickets for a circus show. Satyam unsuccessfully tries to get money from his parents, Bhushaiah and Santhamma. As part of the plan to extract money, Dharmaiah tells lies that Satyam committed suicide. Santhamma loses her life in shock and Satyam and Dharmaiah decide to never lie in their life. Rest of the story is about how they stand with truth despite the hardships they face. Teacher Prasad files a case against Papaiah about mixing salt in ammonia fertilizer. His student Dharmaiah gives evidence before the collector and causes the loss of reputation to President Papaiah and loss of job for his father Kotaiah. Dharmaiah escapes from house and hides in Bhushaiah's farm house to avoid ire of his father. Kotaiah searches for his son and reaches the farm house. Bhushaiah's group catches Kotaiah and misunderstands that Papaiah sent him to steal his rival's herd. Satyam comes to rescue and gives evidence before the collector to save Kotaiah. None of the village elders, Papaiah, Bhushaiah and Kotaiah, can understand the intensity of the friendship between Dharmaiah and Satyam and their commitment to truth.
