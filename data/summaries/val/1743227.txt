Jean Valjean , a man arrested for stealing bread nineteen years previously, is released on parole. Since no one else is willing to allow a convict to stay the night, Valjean is kindly welcomed by Bishop Myriel to spend the night in his home. Valjean explains to Myriel that he is going to become a new man the following day. However, that night, Valjean steals Myriel's silverware and flees. Valjean is later arrested and brought back to Myriel, but Myriel tells the police that Valjean did not steal his silverware, but that he, in fact, actually gave it to him and also gives him his expensive candlesticks. Myriel then reminds Valjean of his promise that he was to become a new man that day. Nine years later, Valjean is now a wealthy industrialist and a mayor. He eventually befriends Fantine , a single mother-turned-prostitute, after he rescues her when she was nearly arrested by the police officer Javert , who previously served as a guard at the prison Valjean was held in. Javert starts to become suspicious that the Mayor and Valjean are the same person. Later, Valjean receives word that another man ([[John McGlynn  is mistaken as being him and is about to be rearrested. Valjean arrives at court where the man is being tried and reveals his identity that he is the real Valjean. Valjean then returns home and finds Fantine deathly ill. Before she dies, Valjean promises Fantine that he will raise her very young daughter, Cosette. Javert arrives at Valjean's home to arrest him, but Valjean escapes and flees the community. Valjean eventually finds and rescues Cosette at the Th√©nardiers, corrupt innkeepers who were supposed to care for her, but were actually abusing and enslaving her. Both Valjean and Cosette finally make it to Paris where they start a new life together. Ten years later, Cosette , now a teenager, falls in love with a revolutionist, Marius . Meanwhile Javert is now undercover as an insurrectionist trying to undermine the organization to which Marius belongs. In an attempt to finally arrest Valjean, Javert is captured by Marius and is brought to the barricades as a prisoner to be executed. Valjean journeys to the barricades himself when he learns how much Cosette and Marius love each other, intending to convince Marius to return to Cosette. When the soldiers shoot and kill Gavroche , a young boy allied with the revolutionists, Valjean uses his influence with Marius to have Javert turned over to him, so that he himself can execute him. Valjean takes Javert to a back alley, but instead of killing him, sets him free. Marius gets shot and Valjean takes him down a sewer. Javert catches them, but agrees to spare Marius. Valjean takes Marius back to his home, also saying goodbye to Cosette. When Valjean returns to Javert, Javert tells him that he is now unable to reconcile Valjean's criminal past with his current lawful existence and the goodness that Valjean has shown. Stating, "It's a pity the rules don't allow me to be merciful," Javert finally sets Valjean free, shackles himself, adding "I've tried to live my life without breaking a single rule," and throws himself into the Seine. Valjean walks down the empty street, finally a free man, with a smile on his face.
