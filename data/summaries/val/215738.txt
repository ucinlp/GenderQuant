Set in contemporary Paris, the movie is a variation of the classic Greek myth of Orpheus. At the Café des Poètes, a brawl is staged by acolytes of the Princess  and the young poet Cègeste , a rival of Orpheus, is killed. Cègeste's body is taken to the Princess's car by her associates, and Orpheus  is asked to accompany them as a witness. They drive to a chateau  accompanied by abstract poetry on the radio. This takes the form of seemingly meaningless messages, like those broadcast to the French Resistance from London during the Occupation. Orpheus becomes obsessed with Death . Heurtebise , her chauffeur, entertains analogous unrequited love for Orpheus's wife Eurydice . They fall in love. Eurydice is killed by the Princess's henchmen and Orpheus goes after her into the Underworld. Although they have become dangerously entangled, the Princess sends Orpheus back out of the Underworld, to carry on his life with Eurydice, but he cannot look at her or she will die. They believe it to have been a dream, Eurydice is revealed to be alive, and expecting a child.
