When it hatches, it thinks Leafie is its mother. Leafie cares for the duckling and names him "Chorok head" or "Greenie" . Leafie takes Greenie to a nearby glade, where Greenie learns to swim from Mr. Otter and to fly from a bat and an owl. However, Greenie still feels left out because the local Mandarin ducks do not approve of his mother, who they think is crazy. Eventually, a flock of wild ducks flies into the glade during autumn migration. Greenie initially is an outcast in the flock, even though his father was once a guard duck in the flock. Eventually, he is welcomed with open arms when he out-flies all other competitors in a contest to be the new guard duck. After the competition, Leafie discovers a nest of baby weasels, indicating that the weasel that killed Nagnae is also a mother, getting food for her babies. Later, after Greenie leaves Leafie as the guard duck of the flock, the weasel comes. Leafie, feeling that she's done everything and knowing that the weasel only kills for her babies, allows herself to be killed and subsequently eaten, so the baby weasels will not starve.
