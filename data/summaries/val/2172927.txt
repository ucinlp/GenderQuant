Three years after the death of his father, 16-year-old Jonathan Kelly  is still depressed and withdrawn. When he moves with his mother to the small New Hampshire town of Dunkirk, he is immediately drawn to David , a boy who shares his interest in the occult. But when the boys try to satisfy their curiosity about a local ghost story, they discover that somebody is digging up graves in the oldest part of the cemetery, collecting human remains for a dark ritual. The plot then revolves around the two boys' exploration of the town's surprisingly dark history while the ritual  approaches.
