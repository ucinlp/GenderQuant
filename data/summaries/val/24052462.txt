Charlotte, a popular girl on campus, goes to a wild party while her boyfriend Wesley is not in town. When she realizes she's become too drunk, she leaves the party. But Jim, who she danced with at the party soon joins her and she gets forced into a sexual encounter. Feeling shame and self-blame, it's hard for her to find the courage to speak her mind. When she does, many of her friends don't believe her. In the meantime, Jim honestly doesn't think what happened that night was rape. But as members of his own fraternity and campus feminist groups begin to unpiece the grey areas, the ensuing experience challenges the trust and friendship of college students who thought they would be friends forever.
