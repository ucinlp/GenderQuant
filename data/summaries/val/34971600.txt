Ijaloko, an ex-convict and a ghetto chief, abducts five kids from his neighborhood: Johnnie, Small, Konkolo, Fryo and Bobo. He brainwashes them and induces them into using hard-drugs, thereby destroying all their humanity and turning them into a menace to society in order to achieve his wishes. Four of the kids die, one after the other. Johnnie, the luckiest of them all, survives and decides to quit being a gangster and go back to school. Ijaloko will do everything in his power to stop him.
