The movie starts with Kamal getting released from prison after serving a sentence on a rape charge. Ambika and Radha are sisters and are heirs to a wealthy business. Ambika looks after the business after their parents died while Radha is a student. Kamal meets Radha and soon they fall in love with each other while Ambika has sworn off all men.Jaishankar is their uncle who is after their wealth. When Radha brings Kamal home to meet her sister, both Kamal and Ambika have a big fight which ends is Ambika forbidding Radha from seeing Kamal ever again. Ambika then reveals the reason behind the fight. Years earlier, Kamal and Ambika were classmates and Ambika had a crush on him which Kamal never reciprocated. While on a class trip, Ambika gives a note to Kamal that asks him to meet her in his room. Ambika claims that, that night, Kamal entered her room and both had consensual sex, but Kamal denied it and refused to marry her. So she bought up rape charges against him and sent him to prison. But soon the truth comes out. During the class trip, Kamal never received the note which fell on Jaishankar’s son, Raj kumar, who was also their classmate. Raj, lusting after Ambika, uses this opportunity to enter Ambika’s room on the pretext of being Kamal and has sex with her. Since Raj disconnected electricity in her room and the room was very dark, Ambika didn’t know the difference. Kamal, forgives Ambika and gets back with Radha while the bad guys are punished. The movie paired Ambika and her real-life sister Radha in roles of sisters on-screen. Nadia was first offered the role of the younger sister. She refused it and the role went to Radha. The two sisters delivered stunning performances that are fondly remembered by a generation of fans. Ambika played the role of a young and beautiful, yet strong and single woman with aplomb. In this role she plays a dominating business tycoon with a powerful personality. She portrays a controlling and protective older sister for younger Radha, while simultaneously demonstrating a highly glamorous and desirable personality herself. Very soon, in a flashback, she displays a totally different personality as a pretty and carefree college girl, switching between the two roles effortlessly. The director does a beautiful job of selecting scenes that portray all the varying aspects of Ambika's varied persona in the movie, such as a scene that puts her in a corporate boss role, a scene that has her questioning her sister protectively, a scene that shows her caring side in a poor children's home and a scene that underscores her youth and physical beauty in the dressing room. Radha also looks her best in the movie, an actress at the height of her commercial success, totally confident and comfortable about pairing up with her more experienced sister. She refuses to be overshadowed by her elder sister in the movie and comes across as a distinct and talented actress. This is surely one movie where Kamal's role and performance pales in comparison to the collective power of an outstanding performance by two of the greatest and most beautiful actresses in South.
