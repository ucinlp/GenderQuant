The story begins as Frankie Foster ([[Anne Shirley  leaves home for Manhattan after graduating high school. With little money and no prospects, Frankie is just about to move back home when she meets Stanley Benson  at a diner where Frankie has been washing dishes. Stanley asks Frankie out for dinner and a movie and convinces her to stay in Manhattan and take some classes at the local community college. Frankie tells Stanley that she is broke, and he suggests a way she can earn some extra money. She doesn't like the tone of Stanley's voice, but she is broke and has little choice, so she follows Stanley to his friend Johnny Pearson's place . Johnny calls himself a manager, but Frankie immediately knows he is truly a pimp. He offers her an opportunity to earn some money and even gives her a room she can live in. Frankie wants to tell him where to go, but she is broke so she moves in to Johnny's apartment building and begins sleeping with men, for money, during the nights, and working with Johnny's mother, Mrs. Pearson  during the day in the family's bakery, which is nothing more than a cover business for tax purposes. Stanley stays in touch with her and promises her that she can not do this all her life if she would just go to college. After much begging and pleading, Frankie enrolls at Harlem Community College where she meets Gladys . They are both in a creative writing course taught by Professor Carl Roberti . For their first assignment, they must write about their most troubling experience, and Frankie writes about how Johnny is pimping her out. Concerned for her safety, Professor Roberti talks Frankie into leaving Johnny's place and hiding out with him in his house in Brooklyn. Afraid Johnny will have her killed for leaving him, Frankie refuses to leave and eventually stops attending class. Frustrated but undeterred, Professor Roberti finds Frankie at Johnny's place and makes him a deal. He buys her from Johnny for $5000, freeing her from Johnny's control. Shortly afterwards, Professor Roberti dies after being attacked by a flock of seagulls while at Coney Island. Frankie is devastated, but lucky for her, at his funeral, she reunites with Stanley. He apologies for convincing her to become one of Johnny's ladies of the night. She forgives him and they leave Manhattan to start a new life together in Indiana Amish Country.
