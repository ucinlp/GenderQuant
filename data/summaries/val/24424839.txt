The film depicts events surrounding creation of the United States Constitution, focusing mainly on James Madison, the person who wrote most of that document.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0300212/ IMDB entry on A More Perfect Union, accessed 18 October 2009. The period immediately following the American Revolutionary War was marked by intense political unrest, owing to huge debts, the interruption of trade and business, shortages of labor, and personal turmoils, all created by the War. It soon became painfully evident that the Articles of Confederation were insufficient to address the country's needs. A movement was soon afoot to upgrade or replace the Articles, and Madison was foremost in the movement. However, he needed the support of George Washington; he needed to show that a new government would be sufficient to address such challenges as Shays' Rebellion and the growing trade problems between the independent States. Madison was strongly opposed by those who feared a strong central government, people known either as States Rights Advocates or as Anti-Federalists, such as Roger Sherman and John Dickinson. Madison was in favor of a bicameral congress, but envisioned both houses being elected according to proportional representation. In this he was strongly opposed by the States Rights Advocates, and he eventually accepted the compromises necessary to address their concerns. The film highlights the basis for these compromises.
