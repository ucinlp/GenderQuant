 {{Plot}} Medina  is awakened by a voice in her dreams. Reluctantly, she gets out of bed and gets ready to head on out. Before she leaves, she drinks her coffee then performs a breathing exercise to help her relax. In doing so, she addresses the voice from her dreams. Soon after, her friend, Sidonia , drops by to check on her and finds Medina sad and looking at herself in a mirror. Like a good friend, Sidonia tries to lighten the moment, and at the right time, reminds Medina that her friends and family are waiting for her at the wake for her fiancé. Medina gets herself together and she and Sidonia go to the service. Some time has passed since the wake and we now see Medina with her friend Tesla  who admits she's in love with Medina's brother, Enzo , and hints at a possible engagement to him. Medina, though surprised Tesla would be "in love", is happy for them both. Medina and Tesla then set off to see an art exhibit but are kicked out twice by the female security guard who apparently remembered them from the duo's wilder times. Medina, still affected by the tragedy weeks earlier is easily upset, but Tesla quickly decides they meet with Enzo for drinks. The three get together and Tesla and Enzo immediately get a light-hearted conversation going to cheer Medina up. Then we cut to Quinn  looking depressed as his friend Fera  meets him walking down the street. He tells Fera that Nilda left him and took everything including his own possessions. He shows her the "Dear John letter" written on bathroom tissue. Fera's husband, Camden , arrives and the situation is explained to him. Fera and Camden try to console Quinn, but he leaves to clear his mind with the "Dear John letter" still in hand. Fera and Camden follow Quinn to make sure he doesn't do anything anyone will regret. We see Medina and Tesla again as more time has passed. Tesla reminds Medina of an upcoming promotion test which Medina states she has to prepare on her own for. The next scene shows her doing so, with a few clips of her stretching, practicing footwork, spinning swords, staffs and spears. Fera expresses greater concern for Quinn. Camden indicates Fera and Quinn were like brother and sister but the best they can do is continue to look after Quinn. Fera accepts the plan. Camden realizes the show will start soon. He kisses Fera then they both walk toward Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.  The day of the promotion test has arrived and it is revealed that in order for Medina to become a "master", she has to fight and avoid getting knocked down three times, but also has to knock "Master" down once. Medina is quickly knocked down the first time by getting kicked in the thigh and losing her balance. She is knocked down a second time be receiving a palm strike to her chest, causing her to gasp for air. Tesla and Enzo are watching on the side and are concerned. Medina quickly plans a better offense and wins the next bout. As Master confirms her promotion, he provides a few words of wisdom. Enzo and Tesla see Medina in the distance and catch up to her. A few weeks have passed and Enzo and Tesla are engaged now. They express concern for the lack of contact but Medina ensures them she has to deal with things. Enzo reminds Medina about the gathering at the restaurant called Françoise's before he and Tesla leave in a cab. A couple of scenes follow with Camden and Fera looking after Quinn and Tesla and Enzo worrying about Medina before a montage of clips are presented with the song "There For Me" sung by Bonnie Piesse. Afterwards, Medina goes to Sidonia's house where it is revealed that Sidonia is a psychic and Medina was the most successful of her peers. Then, through a brief demonstration, Sidonia explains that she believes Medina will meet someone and be happy again, but in order to do so, she has to allow herself to fall in love again. Medina meets her ex-boyfriend, Jarrod, for the last time before he gets married to Lumina. He surprises Medina with pastries he made to show her teachings weren't wasted. He wishes her a happy 30th birthday by symbolically "toasting" with a couple of cannolis. Meanwhile, Quinn sniffs the "Dear John letter" one last time then drops it in a garbage can and walks away. Later on, Medina, after finished working out, opens the door to leave but senses a presence and stops. She turns around and addresses a voice that sounds like Master but he isn't seen. He reminds her of his advice at the promotion which she acknowledges and thanks him then exits. As she walks down a city sidewalk, she is surprised to see Sidonia sitting in a chair in meditation. Sidonia gives Medina a little reminder, just as Master did a little while ago. Knowing she will see Sidonia at her birthday party later, Medina thanks her and walks off. Quinn and Fera arrive a few minutes later and ask Sidonia for directions. She provides it and gives Quinn a pack of tissues to clean his camera lens. Medina talks to the voice and they both agree to part ways. Fera interrupts and recognizes Medina as her favorite fashion designer. Camden tries to calm Fera down by introducing himself, Fera and Quinn who is frozen in place upon seeing Medina. Camden and Fera see that Medina is frozen as well but step aside. After a few seconds, Medina's trance is broken. Quinn breaks from his too then realizes Medina has been distraught nearly to tears. He offers her a tissue from the pack Sidonia had given him. Medina takes one, Quinn apologizes for disturbing her and walks away. Medina feels an urge to smell the tissue and does so then expresses a look of joy. She quickly turns and requests another tissue from Quinn who eagerly gives her the whole pack. Camden and Fera come over and inform Quinn that their dinner reservations at Françoise's was denied because the space was reserved for a big surprise party. Medina realizes it's the same party that Enzo mentioned so it must be for her, then offers Quinn, Camden and Fera to "crash" the party. They all become excited and agree to go. As they begin to walk away, Medina looks to the sky and smiles. While holding the tissue in hand, she turns then joins Quinn and the others.
