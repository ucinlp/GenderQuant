Donna Trenton  is a frustrated housewife whose life is in turmoil after her husband Vic learns about her having an affair. Brett Camber  is a young boy and a son of a mechanic, Joe,  whose only companion is a St. Bernard named "Cujo." Cujo is bitten by a bat with rabies and his behavior begins to change. While the dog begins to succumb to the disease, Brett and his mother leave for Connecticut to visit his mother's sister. When Donna and her young son, Tad , drive out to the home where Cujo and the Cambers live, the gentle Cujo, now crazed by the disease, has killed Joe and the Cambers' neighbor Gary Pervier. Making matters worse, their Ford Pinto car's alternator dies at the Cambers' house. Donna and Tad are trapped inside the Pinto while the massive dog waits outside, attacking repeatedly, all while Vic is out of town on a business trip. The hot sun makes the conditions nearly unbearable, but Donna knows that certain death awaits them outside. Donna decides that she must do something before they both die from either heatstroke or dehydration, but the dog could be anywhere, however, and attempts at escape are foiled by repeated attacks by the mad dog, who tries to get into the car. The local Sheriff comes to the house, and, after a brief standoff, is himself killed by the massive dog. Donna decides that she must risk going outside to save Tad, but the dog jumps out from underneath the car and bites her in the leg, forcing her back into the car. Eventually, a badly wounded Donna makes an attempt to dash for the house but is attacked by Cujo, the only safety being the car. After a brutal struggle between the desperate mother and the relentless animal, Donna takes advantage of a momentary distraction and beats Cujo with a baseball bat several times until the bat breaks off, leaving only a jagged handle. The dog jumps at her, only to land on the broken handle, impaling him. Donna pushes the dog off and uses the sheriff's revolver to break open the windshield and retrieve Tad, as Cujo had broken all of the handles. Donna revives her son, who had passed out due to the extreme heat and dehydration. Cujo tears through the kitchen window and uses the last of his strength to try and kill the two. Before he can attack, Donna pulls out the Sheriff's pistol and shoots and kills Cujo. She joins her husband outside who has just arrived as the carnage ends and the credits roll.
