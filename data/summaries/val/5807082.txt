In 1938, at Los Angeles, California, a rocket pack designed by Howard Hughes is stolen from his factory by members of mobster Eddie Valentine's gang, hotly pursued by FBI agents to an airfield, where they are caught. Stunt pilot Cliff Secord and mechanic A. "Peevy" Peabody, whose Gee Bee racer was fatally damaged by the mobsters, find the mysterious rocket inside a biplane of their employer's hangar, where the getaway driver hid it. Cliff experiments with it, but Peevy cautions him about the dangers involved. Meanwhile, Valentine argues with movie star Neville Sinclair, a Nazi secret agent, who had hired Valentine's gang to obtain the rocket from Hughes. Sinclair negotiates a new deal and dispatches the mobsters to search for the missing device. Shortly afterward, at an airshow, Cliff uses the rocket  to heroically rescue his elderly friend Malcolm piloting a malfunctioned aircraft. Having been seen by the audience, "the Rocketeer" becomes a media sensation. However, Cliff and his aspiring actress girlfriend, Jenny Blake, begin to have relationship issues after he visits her on a film set, inadvertently causing an accident. Jenny is fired over Cliff's accident; however, Sinclair overhears Cliff's attempt to tell Jenny about the rocket pack. After Cliff leaves, Sinclair makes up to Jenny and invites her to dinner at the famed South Seas Club. Sinclair sends his monstrous assistant, Lothar, to retrieve the rocket who seizes detailed schematics drawn up by Peevy. The arrival of the FBI ends with Cliff and Peevy escaping with the rocket; Lothar also escapes. At the local diner, Cliff and Peevy, trapped by a team of mobsters learns that Jenny had a date with Sinclair and of the latter's involvement with the crime. The diner patrons overpower the mobsters, but a stray ricochet punctures the rocket pack's fuel tank, which Peevy provisionally patches with Cliff's chewing gum.This is an allusion to the Beemans chewing gum that famed test pilot Chuck Yeager preferred in The Right Stuff ."Gone West: Chalmers 'Slick' Goodlin: He was the first X-1 Pilot." aero-news.net, October 28, 2005.

When Hughes demands the return of the rocket, Cliff explains that he needs it to rescue Jenny and Cliff escapes, but inadvertently leaves behind a clue to where he is going. As the "Rocketeer", Cliff flies to the rendezvous where Sinclair, Lothar and the Valentine gang are waiting. When Sinclair demands the rocket, Cliff divulges to the gang that the actor is a Nazi spy.

Cliff uses the rocketpack to reach and board the Zeppelin, but during the ensuing showdown Jenny accidentally sets the craft on fire with a flare gun. Sinclair takes the rocket to save himself, but Cliff pulls off the chewing gum patch. In the explosion, Sinclair dies crashing into the last four giant letters of the "Hollywoodland" sign. Lothar is engulfed in flames as the Zeppelin explodes, but Cliff and Jenny are rescued at the last instant by Hughes and Peevy in an autogyro. Hughes later presents Cliff with a brand-new Gee Bee racer. As Hughes leaves, Jenny presents Peevy with the rocket blueprints she found in Sinclair's villa and he decides that with some modifications, he can build an even better one.
