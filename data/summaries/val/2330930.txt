The film is told in flashback as Diane  explains to American Intelligence how transmissions from passengers picked up from a missile to the moon are by Americans rather than Russians. Harry and Chester are defrauding people in Calcutta by selling a "Do it yourself interplanetary flight kit" that injures Chester giving him amnesia. An Indian doctor  says the only way for Chester's amnesia to be cured is through help from monks in a lamasery in Tibet. At the airport Chester mistakenly picks up a suitcase featuring a marking designed to be a point of contact between agents of a SPECTRE type organisation called "The Third Echelon". Diane, a Third Echelon secret agent, is supposed to give plans of a Russian rocket fuel stolen by the Third Echelon to the man with the suitcase who is taking them to their headquarters in Hong Kong but she mistakenly thinks Chester is the contact and gives them to him. Arriving in Tibet, the two make their way to the lamasary in Lost Horizon fashion. In the lamasary not only do the lamas cure Chester, but they have a Tibetan tea leaf that gives super memory powers to those who consume it. Chester and Harry view the results with lamas memorising great works of Western literature in the manner of Fahrenheit 451; one giggling lama  memorising Lady Chatterly's Lover. The scheming Harry decides to steal a bottle to give Chester the power of photographic memory for lucrative nefarious purposes. Returning to Calcutta where they are followed by Diane, Harry has Chester test the results of the memory herb by memorising the rocket formula that Diane placed in Chester's coat. Not knowing what it is, Harry destroys it after Chester has successfully memorised it. Diane arrives too late, but after seeing the results of Chester's reciting the formula she offers them $25,000 to meet her in Hong Kong. At the airport on the way to Hong Kong an agent of the High Lama replaces the stolen Tibetan herbs with a similar bottle containing ordinary tea leaves. The Third Echelon is seeking the fuel for their own spacecraft with an underwater launching pad in Hong Kong. Their eventual goal is to be the first on the moon where they will establish a base to launch nuclear weapons against Earth to bring the survivors of a docile Earth under their control. With a Russian launch to the moon carrying two apes imminent, the Third Echelon, who were going to emulate the Soviet achievement, decides to gain respect at the United Nations by launching two human astronauts instead of the apes; Chester and Harry. The two are launched to the moon to test the capabilities of their spacecraft and the effects of spaceflight upon humans before beginning their scheme. The mission is successful with moonlight bringing back Chester's photographic memory. Diane decides to leave the Third Echelon when she discovers that once they have extracted the final formula from Chester they plan to dissect Chester and Harry to see the effects of space travel. Diane helps Chester and Harry escape where they are pursued through Hong Kong leading Diane to the authorities and Chester and Harry to meet Dorothy Lamour at a night club where they are recaptured by the Third Echelon. Hope, Crosby and Collins end up in a rocket bound for another planet. There they meet a new comedy team â€“ "The Italians!" as Hope calls them, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.
