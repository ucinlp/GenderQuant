Paul Hoplin is mastermind of a crime to collect a $500,000 ransom, threatening to use an explosive device that Jim Molner designed. He and his gang are holding Molner, wife Joan and young daughter Patty hostage. FBI agents gather in New York with representatives of an airline. Hoplin has been sending anonymous notes, suggesting that a bomb will be planted on a plane. Joan Molner is forced to go alone to collect the ransom payment, while Hoplin's accomplices, a woman named Kelly and a man named Vince, watch her husband and child in a Brooklyn penthouse apartment. Joan barely makes it back by the gang's deadline in time to prevent her husband's death. She is left alone with an ex-con, Steve, who has a history of sexual assaults on women. Forced to defend herself, she kills Steve with a shard of glass. Using the dental records of Kelly, the FBI manages to find the hideout. They disarm Vince and shoot Kelly, wounding her. Now they must find Molner's wife, but Holpin has seen newspaper reports that her husband and daughter are safe. She runs for her life into a subway, and when Hoplin pursues her, he steps on a third rail and is electrocuted.
