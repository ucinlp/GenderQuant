However, he has no chance of retrieving the puppy, who has to stay inside. A few years later, a family moves into the town along with their female dog. Somehow, the puppy, now an atomic dog, manages to escape the plant and discovers the female dog. He has an enhanced sense of smell, strength and memory only given to wolves. They mate and have a litter of puppies. However, upon delivering, the female dog perishes. She is buried in the backyard.
