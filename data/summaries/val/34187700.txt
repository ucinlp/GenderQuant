Part-time ‘Hanuman’ at the local ‘Ramleela’, but full-time cashier at the bank – that’s Bharat, an ‘Aam Aadmi’. He resides in the heart of Bhopal, with Nisha, a school teacher and his loving and caring, but doubting wife, who is concerned more about her husband’s promotion from cashier to manager rather than his flying tricks onstage. Bharat’s father, Shivnarayan, an old-timer who values freedom and hopes to see his country corruption-free someday, completes the small and happy family. However, there’s also an uninvited houseguest in Bharat’s household; Amita, a young, beautiful girl who works at a call center and often likes to hitch a ride with Bharat on his scooter, when he is not busy dropping his wife to her school. Contrary to his wife’s wishes, Bharat’s sole ambition in life is to graduate from his role as ‘Hanuman’ to ‘Lord Ram’ someday. However, that puts him at loggerheads with Sattu Tripathi, younger brother to the local MLA and a bad actor playing ‘Lord Ram’, who is perpetually annoyed at being upstaged by ‘Hanuman’. His older brother, MLA Manku also has his share of problems with Bharat, who refuses to let out an extra room to him for his re-election campaign. Bharat’s happy little haven is disturbed rudely one day when the local ‘havaldaar’ Kushwaah comes knocking at his door, claiming to have caught a thief, Chunnu Farishta, who purportedly stole a fan from his house, a theft that Bharat has no idea about, though the local ‘panwala’, Bachhu Gulukand is a sworn witness. Virtually ordered to come to court, Bharat finds himself suddenly dealing with made-up testimonies, lazy judges, and crooked characters of all sorts, trapped in the system that plagues the country today. Out of nowhere, Bharat finds himself stuck in a hilariously vicious circle of corruption, having to bribe his way from cops to criminals, witnesses to lawyers, and even the judge, all in an effort to get out of the rut that is the Indian system. Along the way, this cashier-cum-Hanuman also finds his ideals again, learning to stand up for the rights of the common man and give a slap to the system, and becomes the subject of national news, exposing the thieves that line every lane here...!
