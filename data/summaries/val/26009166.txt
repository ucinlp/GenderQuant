In an attempt to earn some money, Madhav , Laxman  and Lucky  scam college students into purchasing fake history exam papers. At the beach, Laxman , a water sports official, is ridiculed by some tourists for his stammering. Daboo , Laxman's tomboyish partner, is angry and goes to fight. Gopal  comes and tries to make peace but ends up beating them after they point at him. Three robbers – Pappi , Daga  and Teja  — rob the queen's necklace and are on the run from police and end up in Goa. Pappi, who suffers from short-term memory loss, hides the necklace in Pritam's  house. Pritam, the father of Madhav, Lucky and Laxman, is a school bus driver but is always being pestered by neighbours and ruffians who had all loaned money to his three good-for-nothing sons. Vasooli , who has paid for the Jet ski business, asks Gopal for his money. Daboo fools Vasooli into calling and abusing the police who arrest Vasooli. That night, in the casino Lucky, while playing pool, by mistake strikes the ball on Daboo. Lucky tries to apologise, but gets misunderstood, and both groups get involved in a verbal fight. Madhav and his brothers also open a water sporting business on Pappi's loan. Pappi becomes the first customer but Gopal and his partners tamper with the jet by placing glue on the handle bars. Unable to control the jet, Pappi crashes into the jets from both the groups destroying both the water sports businesses. Pritam goes to meet Gopal's mother Geeta  to complain. When Pritam sees Geeta, he is shocked to realise that she is none other than his lost love. In a flashback, he remembers that Prem Chopra , Geeta's father, doesn't approve of their relationship and asks Pritam to earn 5 lakhs in 6 months to marry Geeta. Pritam and Geeta fight over their children's mistakes. Daboo overhears the conversation and tries to find out more about their relationship. Both the groups start a similar new firecracker business but end up destroying in the ensuing fight. In another meeting between Pritam and Geeta, it is revealed neither Pritam nor Geeta have ever married and that their children are all orphans. Daboo overhears them, and they make Daboo promise not to tell the boys about this. Daboo decides to get them married and succeeds in convincing their children and finally gets the two married. Much to Madhav's disgust, Pritam moves to Geeta's house. When they reach there, Gopal and Laxman are forced to move in the store room. The next few days, Pritam is targeted by Gopal and Laxman's pranks that are meant for Laxman, Lucky, and Madhav. On Daboo's birthday, the family decides to go for a movie, but Gopal refuses. At the cinema, the goon who loaned Madhav gets into a fight with them. Geeta gets injured and Gopal arrives to save his mother. Back at home, Gopal is furious at Pritam and Madhav about the loans. That night, Lucky overhears the fact that they are orphans. He unites everybody and tells them that they are all orphans. Daboo comes and confirms the news. They are all now united, and the next morning the newlywed couple is surprised to see their families together. The united family opens a toy store with loans from Vasooli and Pappi. Pappi tries to recognise Pritam at the inauguration. When they all dance and celebrate, Pappi remembers and accuses Pritam of having the stolen necklace. Everybody thinks that Pritam is the necklace thief. Following a long chase and a hostage situation at their home, Pappi informs everybody that he himself had stolen the necklace and hid it in Pritam's suitcase. Daboo then tricks him into calling the police and he and his goons are arrested. The movie ends with Pritam and Geeta going on their first honeymoon.
