The story is about Anwar  who discontinues his education further at the Aligarh Muslim University soon after his marriage. During his stay the Babri Masjid demolition occurs and as a result he turns a fundamentalist. His wife an educated Muslim girl  tries to alter and change the ideals of her Islamist fanatic husband. But to reform himself he rather chooses the way to jail and starts afresh. The thread of the story is the aftermath of the Babri Masjid demolition and the Gujarat riots. Anwar encounters a group of Karsevaks in a train, all of them headed towards the demolition of Babri Masjid. The encounter greatly disturbs him and he is no longer the same loving and romantic husband to his wife as well as the engrossed PG student. He writes a letter to Samira about his intentions and his decision to join Jehad to seek revenge on others. Anwar goes on to become a full time extremist and plants a bomb in a hotel at the Ramzan time. This hurts his grandfather a lot who is always against extremism. Anwar on the other hand is unstoppable and believes that the deaths of innocents are a part of the Jehad. Sahib tells his grandson to stop all his activities at once and warns him about the ugly consequences, the community has to face, because of his deeds, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Anwar lands up in jail. Samira only has one wish, her husband should come back to his normal life. He should become her old Anwar, romantic and soft person. Prithviraj has again shown that he is the phenomenon waiting to happen. Bhavana too proves that she is no less in acting. Liberty Mammootty comes up with a superlative performance as the grand father. The music, editing and camera work, all deserves worthy mention. The film overall is a guaranteed money back to the viewers with no hidden intentions or caste feelings. The director deserves kudos for his fine work.
