Joe Morton stars in this dramatic comedy, set in New York City in the early 1980s, as "The Brother", an alien and escaped slave who, while fleeing "Another Planet", has crash-landed in Upper New York Harbor. Picked up as homeless, he is deposited in Harlem. The sweet-natured and honest Brother looks like an ordinary African American man, distinguished only by his being mute and - although other characters in the film never see them - his feet each have three large toes. The Brother has telekinetic powers but, unable to speak, he struggles to express himself and adjust to his new surroundings, including a stint in the Job Corps at a video arcade in Manhattan. He is chased by two white Men in Black ; Sayles's twist on the Men in Black concept is that instead of government agents trying to cover up alien activity, Sayles's Men in Black are also aliens, out to re-capture "The Brother" and other escaped slaves and bring them back to their home planet.
