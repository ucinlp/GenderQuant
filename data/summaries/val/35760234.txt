This comedy follows the bumpy saga of Fitz, a pot dealer and rock musician who skips town after one of his deals goes awry. Unfortunately, Fitz and his 16-year-old sidekick only find their way into even deeper trouble. Fitz  is a man in his mid-to-late-twenties who, after the fall of his band  three years prior, has resorted to selling marijuana. He is dating a woman named Monica , who was a fan of his band back in the day. During the day, aside from selling marijuana, Fitz spend his time with 16-year-old Jimmy , a neighborhood kid who ditches school to hang with Fitz. After one of Fitz's clients is caught with weed, Fitz decides to leave Los Angeles, California temporarily for Oakland, California to avoid being arrested. Meanwhile, Jimmy is threatened to be sent to military school by his father  for skipping and failing classes, Jimmy convinces Fitz to take him to Oakland with him to visit his mother, who supposedly lives there. Jimmy's father finds a friend in the police force and they take off in search for Jimmy, believing that he had been kidnapped. Along the way, Jimmy attempts to keep Fitz sober along the trip . Jimmy suggests they switch out vehicles so that it would be harder to track down the pair. Fitz agrees and suggests that they trade vehicles with his ex-band mates , who have since become a tribute band in Bakersfield, California. Meanwhile, Jimmy's father and his friend continue to track down Jimmy and Fitz, while the idea is placed in their heads that it is possible that Jimmy is being raped because he is "an attractive young man." They track down Fitz's vehicle  and convince them to tell them where Fitz and Jimmy are headed, but the band mates misinform them on what vehicle they are driving. Also, Monica has a small affair with her boss  and finds out that she is pregnant with Fitz's child. Fitz discovers the affair after Monica calls him and tells him. Not knowing exactly what happened to Fitz, Monica follows Fitz's trail and finds the old band mates as well, who inform her that he is headed to Oakland to reconnect with his estranged father. Angered that Fitz never told her this, Monica continues to head off to find Fitz. Meanwhile, Fitz and Jimmy stop at an old diner and Fitz argues about his sexuality with a prostitute. Jimmy also reluctantly declines a blow job and a hand job from the prostitute. Fitz and Jimmy decide to stop for food and so that Fitz could relieve himself. While Jimmy is waiting in the car, he notices his father and his friend pulling up in their car in hot pursuit of Fitz and Jimmy. When the pair go inside, Jimmy slashes their tires. Fitz rushes out of the restroom right past the pair. While being chased out, Fitz and Jimmy begin to argue. After a roadside argument, Fitz leaves the vehicle causing Jimmy to chase after him. Once they have talked it out, they turn to realize that their vehicle is being towed. While chasing after the tow truck, Jimmy trips and breaks his hand, causing the guys to fake their names and go to the doctor. The doctor  insinuates that he believes Fitz has kidnapped and is molesting Jimmy because Jimmy is attractive. However, once Jimmy has a cast and sling on, the two run from the doctor's office. Meanwhile, Jimmy's father and his friend track down the towed van and they get a tip to meet at a bar called "Berlin", where Fitz and Jimmy will supposedly be later. They also have a growing concern for Jimmy's safety and fear of his "virginity being at stake" after finding his clothes in a bag in the back of the van along with scratch marks on the sides of the van. Fitz and Jimmy take a cab to "Berlin". During the drive, Jimmy insists that Monica didn't really cheat because she didn't have sex with anyone else. Once at "Berlin", Fitz and Jimmy see that Fitz's father is now the owner of the club and a drag queen performer for the bar. He also believes that sandwiches solve almost any problem there is. Monica meets the guys there and tells Fitz that she is indeed pregnant with his child. However, he blows her off and says that she should go raise the child with her boss, due to her affair. She leaves, angry. Jimmy convinces him to be the father that Fitz's own father never was, including giving up smoking marijuana. He agrees and takes one last joint outside to smoke and gets a rude greeting from Jimmy's father, who bashes him over the head and accuses him of kidnapping. Jimmy and Fitz's father meet them outside and Jimmy confesses that his mother doesn't live in Oakland and that she is deceased. Fitz's father apologizes for never being a very reliable father to him and for not having seen Fitz in ten years. Jimmy's father and Fitz exchange apologies for beating each other up. Fitz returns home. Once home, Fitz busts into Monica's business meeting  and sets a baby's car seat down on the table. He pours out apologies and about how he wants his child to be "nothing like him"  and explains how "kidnapping that kid made him a better person." She says she believes that he has changed, but he is just not reliable enough. Fitz leaves and Monica's boss makes fun of him as he does. Monica stands up and tells her boss to "keep the promotion" because she didn't need it. She grabs the car seat and chases after Fitz, who is pleased to know that she likes the car seat. The movie ends with them having sex in an elevator at her office. After some credits role, a clip shows Jimmy, his father, and his father's friend in front of Jimmy's mother's grave. They leave flowers and Jimmy says goodbye. They leave because the cemetery was freaking them out. A running joke throughout the film is Fitz's "triangle theory", a theory that everything in the world can be connected into threes, making everything a vertices.
