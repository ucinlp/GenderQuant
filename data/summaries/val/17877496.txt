Betty leaves her pet Pudgy home alone with three adorable little kittens. As soon as Betty is out the door, the kittens begin to make mischief, turning the house into a shambles. When Betty returns, she assumes the damage was caused by Pudgy, and punishes the innocent pup. The guilty kittens emerge from hiding and confess by singing the title song. A contrite Betty apologizes to Pudgy, and gives him a big bowl of ice cream shaped like a mountain.
