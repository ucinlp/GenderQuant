A young Psychology student is recruited by St. Andrews Mental Hospital and given the chance to care for mentally ill patients. His enthusiasm for his new job soon changes into concern when some of the patients die mysteriously and the behaviour of his colleagues becomes odd. He soon realises that a Devil has taken over the minds of the patients and that his colleagues are allowing it to harvest them.
