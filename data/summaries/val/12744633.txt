Reginald Denny plays the role of Jeffrey Haywood, who wants to get married to Virginia Embrey . However, Virginia refused to marry unless her older sister, the hard-to-please Angelica  gets married first. Angelica, in turn, finds every man she knows too dull and predictable, and for this reason prefers to stay single. Jeff then tries to make Angelica interested in the mild-mannered and timid Reggie Irving  passing him off as a notorious playboy to intrigue her. He asks his friend Polly to teach Reggie "how to treat a woman right", but he turns out to be a disastrous learner.
