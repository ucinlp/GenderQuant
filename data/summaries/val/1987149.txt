The Englishwoman Sasha lives on Île d’Yeu near France with her ten-month-old daughter and her husband, who is often away for business. One day, when Sasha is home alone, the drifter Tatiana appears at Sasha's door and asks her for permission to erect her tent in the garden. At first reserved and reluctant, Sasha eventually allows her this and both women begin to develop a relationship with each other. Sasha decides to go shopping and leaves Sioffra in Tatiana's care. When, upon her return, she finds everything in order, she finally invites Tatiana inside her house, even though she is irritated by Tatiana's unusual behavior. When Sasha's husband comes home on the following day, he finds an empty house. In the tent behind the house lies Sasha bound and dead. Tatiana holds the crying Sioffra on a ferry, which is leaving the island.
