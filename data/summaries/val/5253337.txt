A distraught Laura Bowman travels to Burma with her sister after her son and husband are brutally murdered by burglars. There she discovers the brutal suppression of democracy under General Ne Win and receives her first glimpse of Aung San Suu Kyi, the embodiment of hope for a peaceful future in Burma. When Laura loses her passport at a rally, she gets detained in Burma. While doing last minute sightseeing, she meets a former university professor and pro-democracy students, monks and others. This puts her on the junta's enemies list. She spends most of the film evading soldiers while attempting to make her way out of the country with her group, which they eventually do. Laura, who is a doctor, decides to remain in Thailand treating refugees fleeing oppression.
