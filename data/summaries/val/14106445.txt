Meet the Libner brothers: Marvin ([[Daniel Stern , the oldest, is a sergeant in the U.S. Air Force. Buddy , the middle child, is a timid dreamer. Bobby , the youngest, is a handsome rebel in reform school. As kids, they fought a lot and as adults, they barely speak to each other. In the summer of 1963, their tough and eccentric father, Fred , gives them a task: to bring a 1954 Cadillac, bought for their mother, Betty , from Detroit to Miami. As the trip goes on, the three brothers fight and begin to reconnect with each other, while trying to keep the Caddy in mint condition.
