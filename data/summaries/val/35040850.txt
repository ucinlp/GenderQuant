In a small kingdom, Murugan , who comes from a downtrodden community, fights for the eradication of untouchability. His eight-year-old daughter Madhavi  also joins him in his fight. During a village festival, the little girl goes near the deity and is penalised for her behaviour â€” she and her friend, a hunchback, are beaten up. A prince of the kingdom is involved in an accident, Murugan saves him and is duly rewarded with money. The unexpected boon helps him send his daughter to college and she acquires an M.A. Degree. In college, she falls in love with a young man who has no idea about her origins. More complications arise like entry into the local temple by the downtrodden becoming an issue. Finally they march into the temple in a peaceful procession and the lovers marry.
