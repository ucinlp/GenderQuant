Francesca "Frankie" Sutton  is a Los Angeles bank teller who witnesses a robbery. Shortly after the incident, the bank fires Frankie after the police uncover a connection between her and Darnell, one of the robbers. Frankie reluctantly gets a job at a janitorial company where her friends Lita "Stoney" Newsome , Cleopatra "Cleo" Sims , and Tisean "T.T." Williams  already work. Stoney's brother Stevie is wrongfully gunned down by the police after they mistake him for one of the men involved in the previous robbery. The incident prompts Cleo to suggest that they rob a bank themselves. While Frankie is happy to go along with the plan, T.T. is initially opposed the idea. However, when an accident at work leads to her toddler being taken away by social services, T.T. commits to the plot as well. The four women embark on a series of bank robberies, which are investigated by LAPD detective Strode . The women stash the money in an air vent at one of their work sites. However, when they show up for work another day, they realize that their boss, Luther , has discovered the money and fled. The women track down Luther and find him at a motel with a woman. When they confront Luther he is killed by T.T. when he pulls a gun on Cleo. Afterwards, Cleo takes the woman's drivers license to prevent her from contacting the police. With their money gone, the girls rob another bank, which happens to be the same bank where Keith , Stoney's lover, works. Before they make it out of the bank, Strode and his partner arrive and order them to drop their weapons, but as they do, a bank security guard shoots Tisean. Stoney and Cleo open fire at the security guard and carry Tisean to the getaway car with Frankie behind the wheel. As Tisean dies in Stoneyâ€™s arms en route to a hospital, the three women decide to split up. Cleo is the second of the girls to be killed after the police catches up to her. The police catch up to Frankie and order her to surrender. However, Frankie pulls a gun on Strode and tries to run away, but is shot and killed by an officer. Stoney, in the meantime, boards a bus heading to Mexico, but she painfully witnesses the killing of Frankie. Strode spots Stoney on the bus, but lets her go considering she already has been through enough. After cutting her hair in a small motel where she has taken refuge, she calls Keith but doesn't say anything. While she doesn't tell him where she is, she assures him that she is all right and thanks him. The movie ends with her driving through the mountains.
