Mickey and his friends are vacationing in Hawaii. Minnie dances in a grass skirt while Mickey plays a slide guitar and Donald plays a ukulele. Meanwhile, Goofy tries to go surfing, but continually misjudges the waves and lands on the beach instead of on the water. Back on the beach, Donald takes his turn dancing in a grass skirt, but accidentally catches it on fire. After extinguishing the blaze in a shallow pool, Donald pulls up a star fish whom is chased by Pluto. Meanwhile, Goofy continues his attempts at surfing and winds up getting the board caught in his swimsuit. Pluto continues to harass and be harassed by a crab. Finally, in Goofy's last attempt at surfing, a wave throws him under the sand and the other friends hold a mock burial for him.
