On the edge of the vast forests of Russia, where wolves still roam, lies a little cottage surrounded by a big, high fence. This is where Peter lives with his grumpy Grandfather. Grandfather will not let Peter go out into the forest. Peter has a friend, the lovable Ducky , with whom he hangs around Grandfather's yard. A Bird  with a broken wing arrives in the yard. Bird is very impatient with Peter and signals to go into the forest. His heart beating fast, Peter tiptoes into the cottage and reaches over his sleeping Grandfather and his snoring, fat cat. Ever so carefully Peter takes the keys to the gate. Peter has the time of his life playing in the forest with his friends. He helps Bird to fly, using a balloon and some rope. Then everyone skates on the frozen lake. Everyone, that is, except the cat. She chases Bird, but is so fat that she crashes straight through the ice and into the freezing water. Grandfather awakes and sees that Peter is in the forest. Very angry, he grabs his gun and rushes outside. He grabs Peter off the ice and drags him back into the yard. Suddenly the forest goes quiet. Peter looks out through a hole in the fence and sees the Wolf on the edge of the forest. Moments later the Wolf snatches up Duck, tosses her high into the air and swallows her in a single gulp. Peter slings a heavy net over his shoulder and climbs up the tall fence and into the tall tree. Peter falls from the tree and the Wolf attacks him. Eventually, after a fierce struggle, Peter catches the Wolf. Grandfather drives into town with the captured Wolf, Peter standing, triumphant, on top of the Wolf's cage. The town bullies arrive and tease the defenseless Wolf with a gun. After looking into the Wolf's sorry eyes, Peter opens the cage and the Wolf races back into the forest. The ending is a complete departure from the original, in which the wolf is presumably left caged in the zoo. Throughout the later parts of the film, the duck can be heard quacking inside the wolf's belly, and is presumably still alive.
