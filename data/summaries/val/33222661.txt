Benjamin "Benjie" Santos VIII  comes from a long line of warriors and soldiers. His grandfather, Benjamin Santos VI , expects him to be in the army and to be like his ancestors who fougt every battle in the country. He lives with his parents and two sisters named Jesamine  and Anjamin . His father, Benjamin VII, gave up being a military soldier to be what he wants to be, a scientist and an inventor. As a result, Benjie's grandfather did not agree with his decision, so they were forced to leave his grandfather's house and to never come back. They now live in an antique house, where they started a new life. His father, as expected, followed what makes him happy. He invented gadgets and unique deadly weapons. Some examples are the Fart-gun, or the Utot-gun in Tagalog, a fan that shoots bullets, and a tiara that can kill thousands of people. They went to Benjie's grandfather's 75th birthday, where his grandfather finds out he is actually gay. They were asked to leave and to never show their faces again for they are a disgrace to the Santos family. When a civil war in the Philippines breaks out, Benjie is forced to enlist in place of his ailing father, who was said to have high blood pressure and diabetes. After a long time training, their group was to be dissolved for being not good in training. The group trained in the night, resulting in a very good training in the morning. A group of squadron of enemies of the group, incensed with constantly losing to Benjie's group during training, sought to reveal Benjie's sexuality, by making Benjie drunk and filmed a sex video of him. The following morning, the Highest-General called Benjie for the video, and made him leave the army. When Benjamin was going to leave, his friends joined him, and saying, "Hindi kami masaya kung wala ka!" . They leave the army, and on a forest adventure, they hear some trucks and cars moving. They wake up, and follow the cars, resulting in them discovering the location of the enemy base by accident. They go back to the army, and tell the Highest-General about what they saw, but he wouldn't believe them, saying the real enemy base was in Tanay, based on the army's gathered information and instead decided to attack the Tanay base. While the army searches for enemy forces in the Tanay base, they are ambushed by hundreds of terrorists. Meanwhile, Benjie's group returns to the enemy's real base, where they saw the terrorist's trucks with the captured forces, including Benjie's grandfather and Brandon Estolas â€”the group's former commander in the army. They then make plans to rescue their allies by dressing up as girls to trick the enemy guards into letting them inside their base. Once inside, the group kills many people with the tiara, fan, and Fart-gun Benjie's father invented. As they enter the base, the group split up in different ways. When one of the terrorists spots what he thought was Benjie hiding in a metal barrel, he then tells Abe Sayyep , the squadron commander, about what he saw. Abe Sayyep pulls out the wig Benjie put in the barrel, only to find out it was some sort of trickery. As soon as Benjie finds his grandfather, Brandon, and the other generals, he unties them. Benjie's grandfather thanks him and asks for forgiveness for treating him so badly. Benjie is reunited with the group, where Abe Sayyep appears and shoots at Benjie's grandfather. Benjie jumps in front of his grandfather in order to save him. He sees himself in heaven, and sees his great-grandfathers, who tell him that he did very well and it is not yet the time for him to die. He is soon revived, and the group returns home, where they celebrate their victory with a party.
