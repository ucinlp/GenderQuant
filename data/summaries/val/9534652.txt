A mentally challenged girl is defended by a young man who takes care of pigs. He gets into a fight with the local saloon keeper, prompting the man to get the boy drunk and bribe a priest into marrying the boy to the unfortunate girl. A female teacher arrives in town to teach women how to paint. She uses the young boy as a model and then as a toy for her pleasure. The teacher subsequently takes another lover and abandons the young man, claiming that she was unaware of his marriage. The young boy eventually kills his wife, but his father takes the blame for the crime and confesses his sins before he dies in prison. As a conclusion to this sad movie, the townspeople punish the young boy for what he has done. Typical "film noire"See, e.g., Biesen , p. 1; Hirsch , p. 9; Lyons , p. 2; Silver and Ward , p. 1; Schatz , p. 112. Outside the field of noir scholarship, "dark film" is also offered on occasion; see, e.g., Block, Bruce A., The Visual Story: Seeing the Structure of Film, TV, and New Media , p. 94; Klarer, Mario, An Introduction to Literary Studies , p. 59. plot of the film is not the main message of the film. The film is about fighting good against evil, and how criticism of government by PetroviÄ‡ reached another level as battle between good, in the character of mentally challenged Goca, and evil, in most of the characters in the film. Other themes that run through the movie are: selfishness, prudence, jealousy, rejection of right values, and the decline of society. The end of the movie shows how easy evil can be spread and infect people who are in touch with it.
