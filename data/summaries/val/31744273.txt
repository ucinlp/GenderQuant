Valerie, exhausted and parched, has a moment of respite from a chaotic 24 hours dealing with her extended family. Her 'alone time' is fractured by a police detective, Vincent, who feels he might have one hell of a case on his hands.

Vincent bribes her into talking after revealing that Valerieâ€™s 'friend' Triston is locked up in an adjoining cell. 'If you help me, tell me what I need to know, then I'll help you.'
