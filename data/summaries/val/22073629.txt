Firaaq follows the life of several ordinary people, some who were victims, some silent observers and some perpetrators one month after the 2002 violence in Gujarat. It focuses on how their lives are affected and  changed. Khan Saheb , is an elderly Muslim classical vocalist, who remains blissfully optimistic of the situation happening around him. His servant, Karim Mian, tries to alert him to the problems the Muslim community is facing, but Khan Saheb only realizes the extent of the trauma upon seeing the destruction of a shrine dedicated to the Sufi saint, Wali Gujarati. A middle-aged Hindu housewife, Aarti , is traumatized because she did not help a Muslim woman being chased by a mob, and finds a way to atone for her sins upon finding Mohsin, a Muslim orphan who wanders the city in search for his family. Meanwhile her husband, Sanjay , and his brother, Deven , try to bribe police officers to prevent Deven's arrest for gang-rape. Muneera  and her husband Hanif , are a young Muslim couple who return home only to find it looted and burnt. Muneera struggles to relate to her Hindu neighbor, Jyoti  in the following days, as she suspects her for taking part in the looting. Hanif, along with several other Muslim men, plan to retaliate against the violence and their helplessness by searching for a gun to exact revenge. Sameer  Shaikh and Anuradh Desai  are a wealthy, interreligious couple, whose store was burnt during the carnage. They decide to move to Delhi to escape the violence and Sameer comes into conflict with his wife's family over expressing his identity as a Muslim in India.
