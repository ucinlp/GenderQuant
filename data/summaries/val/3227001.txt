In this cartoon, we start with flashbacks featuring a "Goofy"-like version of Christopher Columbus, who is given a cigar by a Native American. His three ships bring it back to their country, with smoke floating from them. A man in Europe rolls a cigar with a leaf and a midget lights it with a small torch, and we see the impact of the popularity of smoking today. Then we fade to Goofy, in the role of George Geef, who is an extreme nicotine addict, smoking various cigarettes, cigars and pipes, as we watch him smoke during the evening and as he goes to bed , when he wakes up in the morning, as he shaves, as he drinks coffee and at work. But soon his throat tickles and his eyes get irritated and he cannot blow out his matches. So he throws away all of his smoking products and decides to quit. It works fine at first, and feels he can do it. But then the boss congratulates George for being able to quit smoking, and as he lights up a cigarette, he says "It ain't easy. If it was, I'd quit!" Another employee, who is now a father, nearly offers George a cigar in honor of the occasion, but then remembers that he quit smoking. Almost everyone at the office still smokes, and George admits that he loves smoking, and he babbles like crazy and runs out of the office like a madman, leading into the following montage...  Throughout the rest of the cartoon, George is searching for a smoke, while he keeps crying, "Smoke! Smoke! Smoke!" Here's where he finds them, only to have them removed in some way or another. *He tries to go into a tobacco store, but it's now closed. He then swipes a cigar from the wooden Indian statue near the door. He is about to light it, but a voice calls out "Ugh!" and a well-thrown tomahawk splits the cigar in half. *He finds some tobacco from a man filling his pipe and a small piece of paper. He then tries to roll his own cigarette the old-fashioned way, but fails. *He tries to pick up a discarded cigar, but a foot steps on it, flattening it and gets his hand in the process, leaving an imprint on his hand that reads, "Pussyfoot". *He picks up another cigar near an elevator doorway, but the door closes on the cigar and as the elevator rises, so does the cigar. *He goes into a smoking room, but is kicked out because it's for women only. *He struggles with a hobo to get a cigarette, but the hobo wins and bops him in the nose. *He tries to grab a cigar rolling down the street, but it falls into a drainage grate. *He grabs what looks like a cigar from a man with a bunch of them, but it's actually a now-leaky fountain pen. *He picks up a white pipe, but it gets blasted to bits as a target in an amusement park shooting gallery. A barker then says, "And the little man wins a big cigar!" *He looks up to see a janitor on a skyscraper drop a cigarette. He eagerly holds out his hand to get it, and even tries to use a ladder to get it, but when he does, it's spent completely; nothing but ashes are left of the cigarette. *Finally, an elderly gentleman gives him a cigar, but it's an exploding cigar, which George still smokes, while the narrator says, "Give a smoker enough rope, and he'll hang...on to his habit."
