Three Miami cops , frustrated at their inability to convict the criminals they arrest, decide to set up a sting as a fencing operation to trap criminals in a pawn shop, recording the illegal transactions on the  new technology of videotape. With less than helpful support from their captain , the trio decides to re-sell some of their stolen items to stay in business. Trouble follows as the craziness continues. They run afoul of the local mob boss, Reed sees his car destroyed by a bomb , they have a shootout with gun runners at a waterfront condominium construction site, and they ultimately arrest the criminals en masse at a party. The original song Hot Stuff was written and performed by Reed.
