Ben Lewis , groomed to be a doctor from childhood, spends his days inspecting the most intimate part of the female anatomy, but for some reason has no idea how to deal with women on any sort of social level. He's even gone so far to join a support group for virginal men, but this type of reinforcement still can't make him a hit with the ladies. When he seeks the help of a sex guru named Pheb , who actually teaches a private class to help socially inept men learn how to please the opposite sex, Ben's luck changes drastically. He begins to take advantage of his patients  and quickly sheds the derisive slang labels of "lork" and "sooser." For all of his newly learned sexual prowess, Ben is still a good person at heart and when he's given a resident assistant named Becky , the young man realizes that true love is more important than a string of sexual conquests.
