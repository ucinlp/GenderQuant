Lt. Kenneth Braden, a newly trained Navy "frogman", is unexpectedly ordered to report to duty, without being able to notify Sally Johnson, his new girlfriend in whom he has taken a serious interest. Reporting for duty, he is told that she is an officer of Naval Intelligence, and was responsible for a recent confirmation of his character and fitness for duty. Commander Stevenson  is ordered to bring Braden to Kosrae so that he can attempt to capture of the current Japanese communication cypher tables from the radio station there. The skipper originally told Braden that he would have to swim a considerable distance, but upon arrival decides to enter and remain in Lelu Harbor while Braden scales the mountain.
