Sir Reginald Ford ([[Ian Hunter , known as "Lazybones", is an idle baronet. He hasn't a care in the world, although he doesn't have any money either. His brother and sister introduce him to Kitty McCarthy , an American heiress, in the hope that he'll marry her and so gain access to her fortune which will help out his family. Kitty's cousin Mike  and brings Kitty the bad news that she's lost her fortune. Mike is hoping to grab the maps for some Arabian oil fields that are being kept in the house. They are being guarded by two detectives and everybody chasing everybody else whilst trying to get the plans makes an amusing sub-plot. Back in the main story line, Reginald has discovered that he loves Kitty for herself and doesn't care about her not having a fortune. So they get married, despite the warnings from a pessimistic passer-by who they call in as a witness. Neither of them are broke, but it takes a lot to run the old family pile. Kitty has bought a pub and Reginald and Kitty have some fun serving the regulars there. Back at the family seat Reginald has found a way to make money from all the other idle members of the English aristocracy. He sets up a "Home for the Idle Wealthy" and they come to stay  and act as butler, gardener, chauffeur etc.
