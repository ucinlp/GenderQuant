Overweight, depressed improv actor James  is a Second City cast member in Chicago. He lives with his mother , and cheats on his diet. He quits his acting job on a sleazy television prank show, his girlfriend  breaks up with him, and his agent  dumps him. When he visits his friend's daughter's elementary school for Career Day, he rambles about his problems, boring the kids, and embarrassing himself in front of the teacher, Stella . James relaxes in the evenings by lying on the hood of his car parked "in a great spot" beside Wrigley Field, and during the days by walking around the North Side of Chicago with his friend Luca , appreciating the buildings. While wearing a pirate costume for a hot dog stand, James hears about a Chicago-based remake of Paddy Chayefsky's 1955 Marty, his favorite movie, and one that mirrors his adult life. He knows the director but cannot get an audition. After walking out on his Compulsive Eaters Anonymous meeting, James goes to an ice cream parlor, where he meets "big-time hottie" Beth , who recognizes him from Second City and offers him free ice cream. She asks him an obscurely lewd question, which she then cheerfully explains to him. When James, smitten, returns to the shop, Beth takes him on adventures, including a shopping trip for her to try on underwear. She disposes of him, explaining that she had never been with a fat guy. Meanwhile his role in Marty is given to a clueless young actor, real-life teen idol Aaron Carter. As the story ends, James moves to his own apartment, reconnects with Stella, the elementary school teacher, and continues acting in a movie setting, at the very end of the movie.
