An eerie wind blows as the clock strikes midnight. The windows of nearby houses go dark as people head to bed. The "camera" follows a small figure -- who initially appears to be a little boy, who is later identified in the credits as "Sam" -- dressed in orange footy-pajamas, carrying a treat bag, and wearing a burlap "mask" with one triangle eye and one button eye. Sam's mask bears a stitched smile. It appears that Sam is trick-or-treating. As Sam walks slowly down the street, we see a flyer blowing in the wind with a picture of a young boy who has gone missing. After Sam briefly pauses to poke a broken, abandoned child's doll with a stick, he knocks at the door of a dark house, apparently soliciting for treats. He gets no response from anyone inside. As Sam proceeds down the street, a shadowy adult figure emerges and begins to follow Sam. Sam eventually wanders down a dark alley. The stranger looms behind Sam, who silently turns and lifts up his treat bag in an innocent gesture. The "camera" zooms in and we get a close-up of Sam's eye as it open wide with panic. The "camera" cuts away -- we hear a thunderclap and see a bolt of lightning -- when the camera cuts back, all one can see are shadows projected against the alley wall. A vicious beating is being delivered, and we hear punching and snapping, which cuts off with a squirt as blood spatters against the alley wall. The action pauses. Our point of view returns to the sidewalk.. Eventually, we see Sam walk out of the alley, dragging a conspicuously full bag. Sam turns to the audience, where we see his button eye is loosened from the encounter and blood spattered across his burlap "mask." He winks his triangle eye -- which then glows a sinister yellow. His stitched-on smile broadens.
