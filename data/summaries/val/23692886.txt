Naam Iruvar Namakku Iruvar is about Prabhu and Mani earn money through dubious means to support a few orphaned children. They steal a diamond but while escaping, Mani stuffs the diamond into a toy sitting in a car. Chasing the toy takes them to the house of K.D.Chandrasekhar, a rich man in Ooty and with Mani posing as the longlost husband of KD\'s sister, they enter the household. Pooja, KD\'s daughter, falls in love with Prabhu but just as he is being engaged to her, he finds out that her sister Indu is the woman of his dreams, the woman he had lost his heart to after seeing her for a few minutes in Coimbatore. So, he takes off his beard to assume a new identity as Deva, Prabhu\'s brother and proceeds to woo Indu.
