Spoiled, pompous, self-involved Henry Graham has a big problem: he has run through his entire inheritance and is completely unequipped to provide for himself. His childhood guardian, Uncle Harry, refuses to give him a dime. Henry, unwilling to exercise the only solution he can think of—suicide—devises a plan with the help of his imaginative butler Harold. He can obtain money the old-fashioned way—he can marry it. With a loan from Uncle Harry to tide him over, Henry has just six weeks to find a rich bride and repay the money. Otherwise he must forfeit all of his property to his uncle. Desperation sets in as Henry's attempts to meet a suitable mate all fail. With only days remaining on his deadline, Henry bumps into clumsy, painfully shy heiress Henrietta Lowell. She is the answer to his prayers. Henrietta's suspicious lawyer is a problem for Henry, as is his own distaste for marriage. He considers the latter to be a temporary inconvenience, however, since he plans to do away with his new wife as soon as possible. Murder never far from his mind, Henry takes charge of his wife's life. He reorganizes her household staff, which has been taking advantage of her timidity and naivete. Henrietta is completely disorganized and welcomes Henry's guidance. A botany professor, Henrietta discovers a new species of tree fern and names it after him. She loves Henry and invites him to join her on a canoe trip to a remote area. Henry sees his opportunity to rid himself of Henrietta forever, knowing she cannot swim. The plan works perfectly; the canoe overturns and Henrietta is swept away down the river. But as soon as Henry swims to safety, the first thing he finds is a tree fern of the type Henrietta named after him. At this moment he comes to the realization that he has fallen in love with his victim. He quickly rescues Henrietta and resigns himself to his unexpected fate as a happily married man.
