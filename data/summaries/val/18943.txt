The show follows the lives of Al Bundy, a once-glorious high school football player turned hard-luck salesman of women's shoes; his obnoxious wife Peggy; their attractive but dim and promiscuous daughter Kelly; and Bud, their girl-crazy, wise-cracking son . Their neighbors are the upwardly mobile Steve Rhoades and his wife Marcy, who later gets remarried to Jefferson D'Arcy, a white-collar criminal who becomes Marcy's "trophy husband" and Al's sidekick. Most storylines involve Al's schemes being foiled by his own cartoonish dim wit and bad luck. His rivalry with and loathing for Marcy play a significant role in most episodes.
