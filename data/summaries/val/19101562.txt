Pedley, retiring from the British Secret Service, can't understand why he hasn't yet been knighted. He devises an elaborate heist of an airplane cargo, recruiting Mike Warden, a writer from America, although his real aim is to capture the elusive General Ferranti. Warden travels to Italy to assume control of the scheme along with Pedley's accomplice Sylvia Giroux, with whom he soon falls in love. They are arrested, but Pedley comes to their rescue just in time.
