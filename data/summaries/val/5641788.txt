Out of work scrounger Robert Martin lives with his dysfunctional family who are long suffering wife Kat, accident prone son and pregnant teenage daughter in a shabby house in Hatfield next door to the Galleria shopping centre above the A1 about 25 miles north of London. Competition addict Robert dreams of winning a holiday for his family and when he fails to win a competition in which he feels cheated out of, he flips and tracks down the elderly winners, threatens them with a gun, ties them up in the cellar and steals their tickets. The family enjoy the holiday. However, the Police catch up with Martin, he's convicted and goes to jail. He is later released to find his family life has improved since he was released from jail.
