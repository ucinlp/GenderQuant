{{nihongo}} is a {{nihongo}} who is travelling Japan in search of her mentor, who was the actual {{nihongo}}. She is befriended by a travelling samurai Toma Fujihira, who told her that he rescued her from bandits . They travel to a town run by the Shirakawa, a Yakuza family. They are plagued by the Banki-to, a group of mercenaries. This group is led by Banki, an evil man who is excellent in sword fighting but who has a deformed face. Ichi is befriended by Kotaro, a boy who lives with his drunkard father. After helping Toma win money from Ch≈ç-han, they are followed by five Bankito who threaten to take their money. After Toma refuses, he was challenged to a fight but he is unable to draw his sword. Ichi slays the gang. The Shirakawa leader's son, Toraji, assumes that it was Toma who slew the men and makes him his personal bodyguard. Ichi is convinced by Kotaro and his father to stay in the hope of Zatoichi passing through. Toma confesses that although has fighting skills he is unable to draw his sword because of guilt for blinding his mother in an accident. The Bankito plan their revenge. They kill the head of the Shirakawa. Toma is unable to defend anyone and is left unconscious. Ichi admits that it was her who killed the earlier men and after displaying her skills, the second-in-command is convinced and takes her to the mountains to meet their leader, Banki. After slaying two members who doubted her skills, Banki attacked and injured her, while stating that he has met her father. She was thrown into a locked ditch and left to die. We were able to see Ichi's backstory. Ichi was born blind. As an infant, Zatoichi rescued her and left her in the care of a group of {{nihongo}}, visiting her and secretly teaching her the techniques Zatoichi had mastered. Ichi grew up to be a musically talented and beautiful woman. After one of her goze group's performances, she was raped by one of the patrons. She was later exiled by the {{nihongo}}, even if it broke the other members' hearts as it is forbidden for a goze to have lovers or marry. She pleaded to the man who had raped her to talk to the leader of the goze so she can go back to the group, but he mocked her instead and tried to attack her again but she was able to draw her sword which is hidden in her cane and killed him. Ichi then travelled Japan to look for her father instead. Toma was attacked by the members of the Yakuza clan because of his deceit, but Toraji told him that they still need his help to defeat the Bankito. He went with Kotaro's reformed father to their hideout and was able to save Ichi. Banki swore revenge. While recovering, Ichi explained the reason why she's searching for Zatoichi. She wanted to see him one last time before she commits suicide. Toma as able to convince her to go on living. Later, while she slept, Toma left her to go help the Shirakawa fight the Bankito. Ichi woke up and Kotaro told her about the fight that's going on in the town. The Yakuzas were outnumbered by 2 to 1. Still, Toma was unable to draw his sword. But when Banki demanded for him to fight him, Toma stepped forward, ready to fight. He was able to overcome his guilt and was able to draw his sword. The two men fight, Toma showed everyone that he is indeed an adept swordsman. Toma was able to give a fatal strike to Banki but Banki gave him a fatal strike in return as well. Toma dies in Ichi's arms and tells her not to lose hope. Banki tried to charge on Ichi but she was able to draw her sword again and finally killed the clan leader, whose horribly scarred face was later revealed. Fearing for their lives, the few remaining members if the Bankito fled. Later we see Toraji rebuilding his town and assuming the leadership of his Yakuza clan. Ichi by Toma's grave. Ichi played his favorite song one last time. Resuming her search for her father, she bid her friend Kotaro farewell and gave him a keepsake. She said that Kotaro was right all along, she needed light for her journey.
