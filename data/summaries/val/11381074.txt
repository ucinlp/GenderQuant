Mary Carroll  is a young woman from upstate who came to New York City to find a job and a career, but whose money has almost run out. Jack Bacon ([[Norman Foster  is an aspiring artist who lives in the same Greenwich Village building as her, in the attic loft. Both are months behind on their rent, and their landlord, Max Eckbaum , a good-natured soul who nevertheless has expenses to meet, comes up with a solution, to move Mary into Jack's loft, and have them share the apartment on a shift basis. They would never see each other or know who the other is, since Jack is out all night and sleeps during the day, and Mary is taking a job selling refrigerators by telephone, which keeps her out all day. However, each still manages to get a very bad impression of what the other is like, when each realizes that the other is of the opposite sex from articles of clothing lying about. A series of misunderstandings leads to a series of increasingly annoying pranks aimed at each other. Jack places a bucket in the shower, and when Mary takes one it falls on her head. Then she places Jack's suit in the shower, so that it gets wet. In retaliation, he saws her bed in half so that it would come apart when she sits on it. Their situation really gets complicated when Mary and Jack manage to accidentally meet out of the apartment, each not knowing who the other is, and begin to fall in love. Matters get worse when Mary's boss, lecherous H. Harrington Hubbell , tries to invite her out for dinner, and Jack's would-be "patron", lonely, libidinous and rich older woman Elise Peabody Willington Smythe , tries to maintain her monopoly on the artist. When Jack accompanies Mary to a company picnic, they slip away from the group together and miss the bus back to town, forcing them to take a taxi. When they arrive at Jack's home, Mary realizes that Jack is her roommate. Trying to allay what he assumes are her suspicions about the arrangement, and unaware that Mary is the person he's been sharing the attic with, Jack strongly denounces his co-tenant to her, until the landlord comes and lets them know who is who. Both Elise and Hubbell also arrive, Elise tries to bribe Mary, and a protective cabdriver, Fritzie ([[Guinn Williams , punches Hubbell, mistaking him for Jack. Realizing his mistake, Fritzie then goes to his cab where Jack is pleading with Mary. Fritzie is about to punch Jack when Mary intervenes, and the cab drives off with Jack and Mary kissing in the backseat. Asked if they will get married, the landlord says, "I arranged it."
