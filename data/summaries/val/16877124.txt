The film opens in 1821 when Philip Wayne  and Paddy Clarke  are exploring part of New Zealand and stumble upon a Māori burial cave. Captured by the Māori, they manage to impress them enough to be offered a trial by challenge, which Wayne succeeds in. The Māori chief, Hongi Tepe  adopts Wayne. BFI database - synopsis
