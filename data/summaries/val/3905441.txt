{{Expand section|datePart 1Part 2Part 3 The Evoluders attack Earth. They are eventually repelled by the EDF and Orgun. Zoa, the Evoluder military commander, ignores the orders of Mhiku, whom he has installed as a puppet regent, and personally joins the fight. He fires the main anti-matter cannon, but Orgun stops it with his Grand Cross attack, which requires sunlight. Orgun dies in the process, while Tomoru survives. Zoa is killed and Mhiku resumes ruling the Evoluders, who peacefully leave Earth. Tomoru and Kanzaki walk off into the sunset.
