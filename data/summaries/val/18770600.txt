In 1919, during the Russian Civil War, a small force of Red Army soldiers which survived a crushing defeat by the Whites is forced to flee into the Karakum Desert. Among them is female sniper Maria, who has already claimed forty enemy dead. When the unit ambushes a camel caravan transporting White soldiers, she tries to shoot their officer and misses. The man, a lieutenant named Govorukha-Otrok, is carrying a letter from Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak to General Anton Denikin which states he has secret information to be conveyed orally to General Dratsekno. Maria is entrusted with guarding him. Tensions arise between both: the officer is a well-educated aristocrat who is both amused and impressed by the fisherman's orphan Maria's crude attempts to compose Agitprop poetry. When their camels are stolen, their commander decides to send his captive on a boat to their headquarters in Kazalinsk via the Aral Sea. The vessel capsizes in a sudden storm, and only Maria and Otrok remain alive, stranded on an isolated island. The Red soldier treats the White officer when he catches a fever and is slowly charmed by his manners, while he is overcome with gratitude and begins to call her 'Man Friday' with affection. When she demands to know what he means, he tells her the story about Robinson Crusoe. The two fall in love, and seem to forget about the war. When a boat approaches their isle, they first think these are fishermen and run toward them. Otrok recognizes them as White soldiers and intends to join them. Maria shoots him in the back, killing him. As she realizes he is dead, she runs into the sea and embraces his corpse.
