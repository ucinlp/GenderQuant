The story is set in a seaside port, largely among a community of pearl fishers. The protagonist is the son of a doctor/scientist who was sometime in the past forced to save his son's life by implanting him with gills. Thus he is able to live under water, but must keep his secret from the world. The conflict arises from his falling in love with a pearl-fisher's beautiful daughter. His secret is discovered and the girl's stern father attempts to exploit Ichtyandr for his ability. Due to being kept caged under water, he loses the ability to live in the open air, and must now permanently live in the sea. Although set free, the lovers are permanently parted from each other. Although ostensibly a lost-love-tragedy like Romeo and Juliet, the film has a significant focus on greed and commercial exploitation , possibly under the influence of Socialist Realism.
