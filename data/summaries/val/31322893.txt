Dieter, Angela, Kohle and Karl-Heinz are a group of delinquent youths who prowl Sch√∂nhauser Allee, in Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg. The four, each with his troubled life, are often in trouble with the police. Karl-Heinz steals an identity document and uses it to enter West Berlin, where he murders a man while committing armed robbery. The police suspects that his friends assisted him. When he returns, Kohle and Dieter try to find out what he had done; He threatens them both with a pistol, and Kohle knocks him unconscious. Dieter and he believe they have killed Karl-Heinz, and flee to West Berlin, from where they plan to get to the Federal Republic of Germany. Dieter regrets their escape. He pretends to be sick, so Kohle would leave without him. He drinks a solution of coffee and tobacco to feign illness. On the next day, he discovers "Kohle" dead, after he consumed the remains of the beverage. Dieter returns home, where Angela awaits his child, and explains the situation to the police. He is released, while Karl-Heinz is imprisoned.
