Radio-singer Bing Crosby  is not very serious about his career. His chronic tardiness and his affair with the notorious Mona Lowe  has become an issue at station WADX. After Mona cheats on him, the despondent singer meets Texas oil man Leslie McWhinney , who has also been wronged by a woman. Soon after, Anita Rogers , the former fianc√©e of McWhinney, falls in love with Crosby. Meanwhile, station manager George Burns  is plagued by the addled conversation of his stenographer, Gracie Allen  and eventually loses the radio station. McWhinney buys the station in order to help out Crosby and Anita, whom he still loves. McWhinney comes up with the idea of putting on a "big broadcast" of stars to pull the station out of debt. Mona returns on the scene and threatens the budding romance between Crosby and Anita, as well as the station's upcoming big broadcast. McWhinney tries to find a phonograph record to replace the absent Crosby, and ends up impersonating Crosby on the air. The singer returns and takes the microphone in mid-song. Crosby, who actually has been feigning irresponsibility to bring McWhinney and Anita together, succeeds both in reuniting the former lovers and in taming Mona.
