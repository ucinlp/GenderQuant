While living at her parents' mountain home, Emily  is visited by her friend Angelica , who invites her to a rave party in the woods. Her parents, Leo  and Justine , let her attend, under the condition that she returns at midnight and calls if she's going to be late. Arriving early at the party, Angelica immediately attempts to acquire ecstasy and suspects an attendee named Swan  is carrying the drug. When asked about it, Swan informs the two girls that he doesn't have any ecstasy on him, but he has it in a nearby cabin, where his friends live. He requests that Emily and Angelica come to the cabin with him and meet his friends; the two comply. Unbeknownst to the girls, Swan's friends are actually his father Chaos ([[Kevin Gage , a notorious and wanted criminal and his father's gang, which consists of Chaos' girlfriend Daisy  and felon Frankie . Chaos sent his son to the party to lure unsuspecting females to him. Upon their arrival at the cabin, Emily and Angelica are quickly captured by the gang and taken to an abandoned part in the woods. The girls manage to escape their captors and split up in an attempt to make it harder for Chaos and his gang to find them. Angelica is ultimately caught by Daisy and brought before Chaos, who tortures and stabs her death, and then proceeds to violate her corpse. Chaos and his group continue their pursuit of Emily, even as the sun sets. They briefly re-encounter her, but Emily manages to steal Daisy's knife in a struggle and stabs Swan in the genitals. Knowing his wound is fatal, Chaos suffocates his son and promises to murder Emily. Meanwhile, Justine becomes nervous about Emily's whereabouts when she doesn't answer cell phone and convinces Leo to call the police. However, Justine suspects MacDunner , the investigating officer, won't attempt to find her, so she and Leo go into the woods themselves. While searching for Emily, the couple find Angelica's corpse. Chaos and Frankie finally recapture Emily and bound her with rope. In retaliation for his son's death, Chaos brutally violates Emily with his knife. With both girls dead, the gang prepares to leave the area, when Chaos' van fails to start up. Knowing that they'll be caught if they stay in the woods, Chaos and his gang leave the vehicle and look for a car to steal. Their van is then found by MacDunner and his partner Wilson , who discover blood stained clothes. The gang decides to go to a nearby house, with the intent of stealing the owner's car, unaware of the fact that they arrived at Emily's home. Leo lets Chaos and his group stay at the home, but notices that Daisy is wearing Emily's belt. Suspecting the group of being involved with Emily's disappearance, Leo calls the police, while Chaos and Frankie prepare to hot-wire his car and kill the couple. Chaos is confronted by a shotgun wielding Leo, determined to find out what happened to his daughter. When Frankie arrives with a captured Justine, Chaos disarms Leo and takes the shotgun. Instead of shooting Leo and Justine, however, Chaos shoots Daisy when she tries to convince him to leave the house. In the ensuing confusion, the couple escapes. Leo emerges with a chainsaw and slashes Frankie across the stomach, and proceeds to attack Chaos. In the ensuing struggle, Leo manages to get the upper hand and prepares to kill Chaos. Before he can, MacDunner arrives and kills Leo when he refuses to drop his weapon. Justine retaliates by shooting MacDunner in the back and Wilson is killed by Chaos. Chaos then shoots Justine in the head and his laughter is heard.
