A director by the name of Alan Smithee has been allowed to direct Trio, a big-budget action film starring Sylvester Stallone, Whoopi Goldberg, and Jackie Chan. The studio recuts the film, and when Smithee sees the results  and realizes that he cannot use a pseudonym  he steals the film and goes on the run, threatening to burn it.
