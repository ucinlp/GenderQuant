In an attempt to bring a higher level of class and sophistication to VeggieTales, Archibald Asparagus requests and receives permission to run the show. The countertop is then modified with a faux fireplace and wing chair  and Archibald introduces the first segment. This segment was intended to be a VeggieTales production of the Shakespearean play Hamlet with the help of Phillipe and Jean-Claude, The French Peas. In the story, Omelet, played by Jimmy Gourd, is a prince of a kingdom in Denmark who desires some eggs "cooked light and fluffy" to eat. A baker brings them to him and informs Omelet that these are the last eggs in the kingdom. Regardless, Omelet feels happy about eating the eggs until Ophelia  asks him to instead share the eggs with the kingdom. However Omelet selfishly refuses. Later, Omelet joins a game of Battleship with a villager and is encouraged by him to share the eggs. As Omelet announces his plan to share, he learns that the town has plenty of eggs  and has light-and-fluffy eggs, or "omelettes", cooked for everybody. The segment ends with Larry and Junior in the audience bewildered by the antiquated English. Following this segment is the introduction to the usual "Silly Songs with Larry". Archibald intervenes and changes the segment to "Classy Songs with Larry". Opening with a bus stop scene similar to Forrest Gump and sung to the tune of Funiculi Funicula, Larry tells a growing group of bystanders ]] about his "high silk hat" and box of chocolates, while trying to keep his hat from being ruined or his chocolates from melting in the hot sun. Eventually Apollo Gourd comes and sits on Larry's hat and chocolate, much to his dismay. Finally, Archibald presents the "long lost musical of Gilbert and Sullivan," provided by The French Peas, entitled Lyle the Kindly Viking. In this segment, Junior Asparagus is a young boy named Lyle who quietly lives on an island with his fellow Vikings. As the Vikings return to the island with loot pillaged from a nearby monastery, Lyle slips out on his own ship and gives the monks his minuscule share of loot  as a small act of recompensation. One day, Lyle's trips are discovered by fellow Vikings Sven and Otar , who confront him, but Lyle convinces them that sharing is a much nicer alternative to pillaging and plundering. The next day, Lyle is discovered by the Viking leader Olaf , who unfortunately does not agree with Lyle's beliefs. When a great storm capsizes the Viking ships, the Monks manage to rescue Lyle. Lyle then convinces the Monks to save the rest of the doomed Vikings. This show of kindness convinces the Vikings to turn over a new leaf and share what they have rather than looting and pillaging from others. In the closing countertop sequence, Archibald discovers that his story was NOT written by Gilbert and Sullivan, as he had been told. Angry at being duped, Archibald chases the Peas off and the scene falls into chaos.
