This is not a direct adaptation of the Mary Shelley novel, but a postmodern gothic reinvention set in present-day New Orleans. It recasts the doctor as the villain and the creature as a tragic hero determined to stop him; the primary action involves two police detectives  who enlist the aid of the creature  to stop a serial killer who is one of Victor's later creations.
