The story is that of a rich medical student, Kannamma - played by Meena - who falls in love with Anandan  after he saves her from an acid attack by her driver, Babu . Anandan's friend Madan  becomes Kannamma's ever-vigilant sentinel, risking his own marriage with Mala . Kannamma comes to know of Anandan's martyrdom through TV. Her baby is disputed and she is brought before a village council. These scenes sorely test the viewer's intelligence. With a new generation gradually taking over the party, octogenarian Karunanidhi's message perhaps lies in the two songs he has written, one of which is addressed to youth. The other song, "Iru vizhi mazhai", is sung by Vani Jayaram.
