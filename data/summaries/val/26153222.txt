A man , a charming English gentleman changes the lives of three generations of women who run a near-bankrupt bed and breakfast. He is beaten up by criminals and thrown off a yacht. The three generations of women pick the bloodied man off a beach and offer him free board in return for fixing the place up and being the handy man. Claire , widow of senator Blake Wellesly, is initially unwilling to let the man in the house, partly due to the mystery around him caused by amnesia, though her mother-in-law Ruth  - who is recently retired and craving for adventure - insists on allowing the man to be in their house. Claire's teenage daughter Cassie , who is rebellious against her mother's old-fashioned behavior most of the time, names the man Adam.
