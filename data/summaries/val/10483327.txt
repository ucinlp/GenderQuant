Cassie  is a thirteen-year-old goth girl who just moved to a new neighborhood and new school. She loves playing tricks on the popular kids at school and her younger brother Max . On the way to the library, Cassie finds a mysterious Halloween store down an alley and goes inside. The store owner  sells her a book called The Evil Thing, which contains a warning on the front page: "DO NOT READ ALOUD". That night, Cassie ignores the warning in the book and reads it to Max to get back at him for turning off her computer in the middle of her writing a report. Priscilla , who stole The Evil Thing from Cassie's bag in school, films her jumping in fear, after using a CD player to play monster sounds outside in order to make the monster appear to have come to life. Later that night, The Evil Thing is brought to life by Max's thoughts and captures him, Priscilla, and a Papa John's Pizza delivery man. It is up to Cassie and Sean  to save them. At first, they try to defeat The Evil Thing on their own, but fail. Cassie then asks the owner of the shop, where she bought the book, for help. Cassie discovers that the store owner travels around the world each Halloween, searching for the person who loves to scare people the most. He leaves them with only a riddle  for help before making his shop disappear. After he disappears, Sean makes remarks that solve the riddle. Together, they formulate that if they get blood from a roast that Cassie's mother made and throw it on The Evil Thing, it will be forced to suck up the blood. In doing so, it will devour itself. By using Sean's CD of monster sound effects, they are able to lure the monster to the CD player; however, when the monster nudges it, the music turns into hip hop, thus ruining their plan. While fumbling, Sean and Cassie accidentally drop the blood on Max, who must conquer his fears and save the day. When Cassie encourages him, Max tosses the blood onto The Evil Thing, causing its heads to begin attacking each other. The monster eats itself, eventually exploding in a shower of yellow blood, taking its offspring with it. With The Evil Thing destroyed, Max, Sean, and Cassie save Priscilla. She angrily accuses Cassie of being a witch and Sean rejects Priscilla in favor of Cassie. After Priscilla leaves, they save the pizza delivery guy, who offers them free pizza in return for his release. They burn the book and rid themselves of The Evil Thing, with Cassie replacing her blood-splattered clothes with a cute outfit her mother bought her; Sean is allowed to borrow their father's clothes. Sean leaves shortly after they burn the book. Cassie and Max's parents then come home and find the book in the fireplace. The father mockingly reads it out loud, reviving The Evil Thing. The movie ends with Cassie realizing that The Evil Thing has been brought back to life and that it is not over yet.
