A lunatic with a digging compulsion  escapes from an asylum, steals a jackhammer and proceeds to open up a main street and traffic artery in Tel Aviv . Rather than question his actions, the police, as well as city officials, assume he is operating under the municipalityâ€™s orders and aid him as much as they can. Complaints from local residents, whose lives become a living hell due to the noise and traffic jams, lead to infighting amongst city departments. To speed up the work, so that it would be completed before the start of the municipal elections, the city sends armies of construction workers and heavy equipment to help the lone compressor, turning a mere annoyance into a full blown disaster. By the time the city officials realize they are destroying a street without any plans or goals it is too late: Allenby Street is connected with the Mediterranean Sea and a canal is created. The mayor then declares, in a flamboyant opening ceremony, that Tel Aviv has been turned into the Venice of the Middle East. The lone citizen  who realized that the 'project' was the work of a lunatic, is laughed at, and branded a lunatic himself. In the final scene, Blaumilch is seen digging up Kings of Israel Square near Tel Aviv's municipality building.
