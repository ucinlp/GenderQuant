As the story opens, a Corporal Bower ([[Ben Foster  and a Lieutenant Payton  wake up from hypersleep aboard the sleeper ship Elysium. The ship is on a mission from an overpopulated Earth to the earth-like extrasolar planet Tanis on a colonizing mission. With no recent memory and the ship racked by power surges from its unstable reactor, Payton sends Bower to stabilize the reactor, since his position and latent memories imply that he is an engineer. While making his way through the ship, Bower finds emaciated corpses and has to avoid strange, pale humanoid beasts who use bladed weapons and lassos to catch and kill their prey. He also finds several people who had been awake far longer than he and Payton, including a genetic engineer named Nadia  and an agricultural expert called Manh . During his journey, Bower experiences the physical symptoms of a mental disorder encountered in long periods of space travel, called ‘Pandorum’. At one point, Payton tells of a prior case where the captain of a passenger ship went mad with the syndrome and, believing the flight was cursed, ejected all the passengers and himself into space, dooming them all. On the flight deck, Payton discovers another crew member, Corporal Gallo , who reveals that he was part of the flight crew that received a final message from Earth, saying that the planet had been destroyed and the only hope for humanity was the Elysium. He claims that his other two crew mates suffered from an onset of Pandorum, and that he had to kill them in self-defense. Payton is wary of Gallo, noting his strange behavior. It is eventually shown that Gallo has Pandorum and is dangerously insane. Avoiding the creatures, Bower, Manh and Nadia find their way into an enclosed area where another survivor called Leland . While gassing his visitors with the purpose of using them as food, Leland tells them the origins of the ships and the creatures, using self-drawn murals on the walls; after the final message from Earth was received, one of the flight crew was overcome with Pandorum and killed his two crew-mates, eventually sinking into a delusion that he was a god of the ship. Alone and insane, the 'god-devil' released several hundred of the passengers and sent them down into the massive hold to fight for survival, all as part of a sadistic game. Eventually bored with his game, the crew member went into hypersleep and the awakened passengers had to survive and fight each other. Eventually, because a special enzyme given to the passengers during hypersleep to help them adapt to conditions on Tanis, the survivors evolved into the tribal creatures that now roam the ship. While Payton tries to keep Gallo under control on the bridge, even sealing him inside a hibernation pod, Bower convinces Leland to keep them alive so they can reboot the reactor and save the ship from destruction. They manage this, barely, and begin to make their way to the bridge, but Manh is killed on the way by a baby creature, though he manages to kill their leader . On the bridge, after Payton injects Gallo with a sedative during a fight, the shocking truth is revealed; Payton is Gallo. He had lost all his memories during his hibernation, but regains them after injecting himself during his delirium. He then kills Leland, who arrives before the others. When Bower and Nadia arrive, Payton admits his actions and tries to make Bower succumb to Pandorum by showing him where the Elysium is now; it crashed on Tanis, and is now lying in the alien world's ocean: the 123-year mission has extended into 923 years. As Payton rants about building a new humanity within the ship  and Bower fights his descent into madness, Nadia attacks Payton, but he easily defeats her. Bower manages to overcome his condition and breaks the window of the ship, getting himself and Nadia into a hibernation pod and activating the pod-jettison action, sending everyone who is still alive to safety, while Payton and the creatures are killed as the ship is flooded. The final shot shows a view of Tanis, an Earth-like planet with two moons. A title card appears displaying: "Tanis, Year One: Population 1,213..."
