{{Expand section}} The brochures in a travel agency spring to life in this "it's-midnight-and-everything-comes-to-life" cartoon, this time in a travel agency with first a bunch of tableaux, followed by a big song, then a crime story. We see a spinning globe, then the front of the agency store, where we see several displays of banners and posters of different countries. Then as we see one poster/banner for each country, we hear a song tied to the country or a pun on the name. For example, with a picture of Bombay harbor, we see exploding bombs! There's a little tour of the world at first, with appropriate songs, which then stray into puns about food. "Food's an Education," so we go to Hungary, Turkey, the Sandwich Islands, Hamburg, Chili, Oyster Bay, Twin Forks and Java. The Thief of Bagdad uses the Florida Keys to break into the Kimberly Diamond Mine, and then pawns them with the Pawnee Indians. He is chased by the soldiers and police of different nations, but gets away by forming an "unusual alliance" with the Lone Stranger: "Well, you're not alone now, Beeg Boy!"
