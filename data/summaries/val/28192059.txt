Muggs and Glimpy have joined the army. Muggs is proud to be in uniform, until he's discharged for having poor eyesight. Crushed, Muggs has no choice but to return home; Glimpy tags along with his pal. Once the duo arrive back to the East Side, they are quick to learn that Danny  has been thrown in jail. Danny's arrest resulted in missing medical alcohol from the warehouse he works at. Muggs and Glimpy obviously believe that Danny is innocent, but they have to find out who really stole the missing items. The duo are suspicious about a new kid in their club, Spider O'Brien. As it turns out, Spider works with Danny at the warehouse, and was invited into the club by Danny. Wanting information from Spider, Muggs pretends to be his friend. Spider fesses up to Muggs, and tells him all about a trap door he has to leave open at night for the gangsters who really stole the items. Muggs also learns that Spider only took this job with the gangsters in order to pay for his ailing mother's medical operation. Sadly, Spider is killed by 'Fingers' Belmont and another gangster, both of whom Spider works with. They feel that Spider ratted them out. As it turns out, 'Fingers' was once a former member of Muggs' gang. Always skeptical about 'Fingers', Muggs feels that he may have been the one who has really been stealing from the warehouse. Muggs asks permission from the police to try and put a stop to the gangsters' actions, and get Danny off the hook. Meanwhile, Muggs' sister has been working as at the bar owned by the gangsters' leader, named Larry. Larry has taken a liking to Muggs' sister, which could mean trouble for her.
