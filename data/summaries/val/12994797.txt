Chow, as in several of his other films, stars as Sing, a mainland country boy hoping to earn a living in Hong Kong. Upon reaching Hong Kong, he finds his luggage stolen, but soon becomes fast friends with the thief, Smart. Together, they try to improve their financial situation through various odd jobs, until Smart discovers Sing's special ability, his extremely strong right arm, and then convinces him to enter a martial arts tournament in the hopes of winning the prize money. The two soon learn that they need to be registered with a school in order to compete. Some scenes do bear some resemblance to Bruce Lee's Fist of Fury including the dojo fight where the Japanese man is forced to eat the sign.
