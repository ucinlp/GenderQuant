Joe Ross  is a corporate engineer who has recently invented a very lucrative industrial process that has not yet been patented. While on a corporate retreat at an island resort, Joe befriends a wealthy stranger, Jimmy Dell , and one of the company's new secretaries, Susan Ricci . Jimmy wants to introduce Joe socially to his sister and asks him to deliver a package to his sister. Joe opens the package on the plane, afraid it might be illegal drugs, but instead finds a book about tennis and accidentally rips the cover. Back home in America, Joe buys a copy of the book in a bookstore to give to Jimmy's sister and keeps the ripped book at his office. Jimmy suggests that Joe's company and his boss, Mr. Klein , might not give him fair compensation for his work. A flirtatious Susan also makes vague suggestions that Joe should trust no one. Jimmy takes Joe out to dinner at a club and opens a Swiss bank account for him  as a gift. Before entering the club dinner, Jimmy has Joe sign a certificate to join the club. Jimmy convinces Joe to use his legal counsel and bring the only copy of the process to their meeting. Joe learns that the sister is a ruse and that Jimmy is actually a confidence man, attempting to steal his valuable work. Joe contacts an FBI agent named Pat McCune he met on the island and is enlisted in a sting operation. To his horror, Joe learns that McCune is actually part of Jimmy's con game. His process is stolen and he has been thoroughly swindled. Joe attempts to explain what happened to his employer and the police, but his story sounds far-fetched. The con has made it appear that he has sold his process to the Japanese. The Swiss bank account that Jimmy opened for him makes it look as though he is hiding assets, and the certificate he signed to join the club turns out to be a request for political asylum in Venezuela, which has no extradition treaty with the United States. The police also show Joe that Jimmy's apartment and the club dining area were not real, but instead were just a normal room and a coat check room for a restaurant, respectively. Joe is also framed for the murder of his co-developer of the process, George Lang . On the run from the law, Joe reconnects with Susan, who believes his story and continues to express a romantic interest in him. Joe remembers that the hotel where the island retreat took place maintains a video surveillance, which could prove that Jimmy Dell was there. Susan loyally accompanies Joe in his quest, but she, too, turns out to be involved in this elaborate con. At the airport, Susan gives him a camera bag, which actually contains a gun, and an airplane ticket supposedly to the island retreat, but actually to Venezuela. Before passing through security, though, Joe realizes that Jimmy left his fingerprints on the original  tennis book he was to deliver to Jimmy's alleged sister. He leaves the airport with Susan, not realizing that she is working against him, and they board a ferry to return home. Jimmy comes to kill Joe on the ferry, seemingly alone except for Susan and a couple of Japanese tourists. The final step of this con is going to be Joe's death, made to appear as a suicide. Jimmy suddenly is hit with a tranquilizer dart shot by one of the "tourists." They are, in fact, US Marshals who have been monitoring Jimmy's con since the beginning. They reveal that Joe's Boss, Mr. Klein, was behind the entire con because he wanted to keep all the profits for himself. Jimmy and Susan are taken off to jail.
