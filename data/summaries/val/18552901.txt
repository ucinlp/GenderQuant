The story revolves around three unemployed people . The story opens with the arrival of Balakrishnan ([[Saikumar  in Cochin to dispute the denial of his company job which he was supposed to receive several years ago. Several candidates overtook his chance and the last one was Rani ([[Rekha  who pretends to be an influential figure in the town. Rani threatens Balakrishnan to continue to work despite his efforts to overthrow her. The company manager  who knows her family situation  helps her to remain in the job. Balakrishnan determined to stay back in the town until he succeeds to get back his job back from Rani. During his stay Balakrishnan finds a temporary lodging in 'Urvasai Theater' owned by Mannar Mathayi ([[Innocent , with another tenant Gopalakrishnan ([[Mukesh , both were unemployed and with insignificant earning. Initially Gopalakrishnan does not like the new tenant and tries to expel him from the house but all his efforts are in vain. Gopalakrishnan is tricky and cunning. He lies to his mother that he works in a large company based in Calcutta and is building a new house in Cochin. Balakrishnan finds out and misunderstands Gopalakrishnan as a fraud. But what shocks Balakrishnan most was the realization of Rani's family situation, which pours sympathy in his mind toward her and decided to sacrifice his job. That day night Balakrishnan gets drunk and reveals the fraud play of Gopalakrishnan to Mannar Mathayi. Goplakrishnan confesses his play and justifies that projecting himself as rich and employed was the only way in front of him to comfort his mother. The truth melts the mind of both Balakrishnan and Mannar Mathayi and they all became friends and decided to enjoy the night despite their unending problems. The turning point of the movie is here. Balakrishnan wakes in the night hearing the phone ring. A gang leader called Ramji Rav ([[Vijayaraghavan  has kidnapped the daughter of a rich businessman Urumees Thampan ([[Devan  and is asking a ransom of a lakh rupees. The three unemployed have no relation with Urummes Thampan; the phone was misdialed. Panicking, Balakrishan tries to find the number of Urumees Thampan from a phone directory, only to find out that the numbers of Urvasi Theaters and Urumees Thampan are interchanged in the directory. Gopalakrishnan develops a quick game play and asks Balakrishnan to act as a dealer between Ramji Rav and Urumees Thampan, without letting them know each other, and demand a ransom of three lakh to Urumees Thampan, instead of a lakh, and get the girl from Ramji Rav and earn two lakh. The plan was set properly, but the job wasn't easy to carry out by hiding from the police and keeping Ramji Rav and Urumees anonymous to each other. Finally after a struggle the three rescue the girl from the gang leader and hand her over to Urumees Thamapan. They confesses the game to him upon a police encounter. Urumees forgives them and is thankful for returning his daughter, and offers three lakh rupees as a prize. The story happily ends here.
