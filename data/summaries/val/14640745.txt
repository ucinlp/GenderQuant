The Stooges are mistaken for three armored car thieves after getting caught in crossfire. Captain Mullin  gives the boys a lie detector test, but finds no reason to hold them. He releases them, and they return to work at their restaurant, the Elite Caf√©. Friend Gladys Harmon  stops by the restaurant just as one of the real armored car bandits flees the scene. They then chase the bandit to a spooky old mansion where they and their hideous hatchet man, Angel , are hiding. When the mob abducts Gladys, the Stooges come to her rescue and retrieve the stolen money.
