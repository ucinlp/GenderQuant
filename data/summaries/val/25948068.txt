On the Caribbean island of Puerto Nueva a disparate group of characters await the Boeing 314 Clipper that will take them to Miami. Tony Bronson is the new purser for the flight. He meets New York journalist Jim Halsey when Tony interrupts the robbery of Halsey's room in their hotel. Halsey, on his way to America to then begin an assignment in the Orient is to be a passenger on the same flight. Having some money left, Halsey fixes Tony up on a double date with two entertainers who have only just been informed that the show they are to do in New York has been cancelled. They use their feminine wiles to con Tony into arranging them passage on the clipper, but Tony falls in love with one of them. Amongst the other passengers boarding the clipper are four men who plan to hijack the aircraft in mid air, rob the plane and passengers, land the clipper in a remote area where they and their loot will be picked up, and then cover their tracks by tying up the passengers and crew and setting the clipper on fire.
