The film opens with events that happened at InuYasha's birth. The suitor Takemaru kills Lady Izayoi just before InuYasha's father arrives. InuYasha's father, still injured from his battle with RyÅ«kotsusei, arrives and resurrects Izayoi with the Tenseiga, telling her to escape with their son, whom he names as InuYasha and gives her the Cloth of the Fire Rat to protect them from the burning palace. InuYasha's father dies in the burning down of the castle as he moves to face Takemaru and draws his third sword. In the present era, Kagome's grandfather comes by with a sword which he calls a "national treasure"; as Grandpa is about to put it in the storehouse for "safe keeping", Kagome's younger brother goes over to the sword, and it speaks, or more accurately, the spirit of the sheath, Saiya. With his seven hundred year spell on the sword So'unga failing, Saiya seeks out InuYasha, hoping he has the willpower to control the sword. Unfortunately, he was mistaken, as it tried to possess InuYasha, but InuYasha tried his best to resist being controlled and finally brings the sword back to the past, but in the process unleashes the deadly Dragon Twister on an evacuated village, a technique far more powerful than the Tetsuseiga's Backlash Wave or the Tenseiga's Dragon Strike. Sesshomaru is also alerted to the return of So'unga, and he follows the scent to find that InuYasha is in possession of the sword. The two of them duel and at a crucial moment, Kagome, having returned with Saiya, saves the day and forces the So'unga to release InuYasha from its grasp. As InuYasha and Sesshomaru depart their respective companies to seek out So'unga, Myoga, Totosai and Saiya explained that explain to everyone that in the aftermath of InuYusha's father's death two hundred years ago, they carried out his last commands for his three swords. While the Tetsuseiga and Tenseiga were taken care of, Saiya claimed that there were no instructions for how to dispose of So'unga. Unable to give it to InuYasha or Sesshomaru, Saiya decides to keep So'unga asleep for at least seven hundred years and had it thrown into the Bone Eater's Well, where it ended up in the possession of Kagome's family. Meanwhile, So'unga finds a new demon host and recovers Sesshomaru's lost left arm from the netherworld, then revives Takemaru, playing on his hatred for the Dog General and his sons. Takemaru slaughters an entire castle and resurrects the living dead to wear down his enemies' strength. During the battle Kagome and Rin are kidnapped. Both of the brothers take off to protect the girls, whom So'unga urges Takemaru to kill to enrage their foes. However, InuYasha manages to overcome Takemaru, crediting his desire to protect Kagome as his strength. Takemaru then realizes that InuYasha's mother wanted him to live and that he loved her. His flesh then erodes to nothing but bones. Sesshomaru then uses Tenseiga to prevent demonic imps from resurrecting Takemaru. However, the battle was far from over. So'unga creates itself a new body and opens a gateway to the netherworld, threatening to end all life on Earth. While Saiya protects the humans from being overcomed by the dead souls from the netherworld, InuYasha and Sesshomaru do battle with So'unga, both determined to defeat the sword on their own. Individually, So'unga was stronger than either the Tenseiga or the Tetsuseiga. As they dueled they managed to combine their attacks and overwhelm So'unga's Dragon Twister, causing the sword and Sesshomaru's left arm to fall into the pit of hell. At the end, InuYasha and Sesshomaru see their father as he thanks them for destroying the sword. After the end credits, InuYasha and Kagome both lay on a hill, and then Kagome tells InuYasha that she thought Sesshomaru didn't like humans, and InuYasha replied that he didn't care at all. Meanwhile Kagome remembered something: InuYasha's enchanted beads. Kagome ordered InuYasha to sit up and close his eyes, and told him that she had a nice surprise for him. While his eyes were closed, Kagome placed his enchanted beads around his neck. Suddenly InuYasha realised that the "nice" surprise was actually the enchanted beads. InuYasha told Kagome to take them off, but Kagome refused to because she didn't want InuYasha running off again. Kagome then tells InuYasha to sit very sweetly which causes InuYasha to fall on the ground and the screen goes black, ending the movie.
