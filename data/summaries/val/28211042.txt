Marina, a sexually inexperienced 23 year old woman, lives with her terminally-ill architect father, Spyros, in an industrial Greek town by the sea. Unable to relate to her fellow humans, she lives her life through the wildlife documentaries of Sir David Attenborough, the songs of Suicide and the sex education lessons given to her by her friend Bella. When a stranger comes to town, Marina has her first sexual relationship with him. She later asks Bella to sleep with her father, as a favour for a dying man, whom she duly obliges.
