The film is concerned with Harrison Lloyd, a Pulitzer Prize-winning Newsweek photojournalist who travels on his last assignment to the former Yugoslavia in 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence. Although he is presumed to have died in a building collapse, his wife travels to the region to find him, believing him to be in the city of Vukovar. Travelling through the war-torn landscape, she arrives in the city, and bears witness to the massacre which took place there. Back home, Harrison's son Cesar cares for his father's flowers in their greenhouse.
