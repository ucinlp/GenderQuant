The plot concerns an oily carnival hypnotist , whose experiments in hypnotic regression take his unwitting female subject  to a past life as a prehistoric humanoid form of sea-life. He uses the physical manifestation of the prehistoric creature to commit murders. The hypnotist's motives are never explicitly described, and the murders happen, apparently, either for revenge or notoriety.
