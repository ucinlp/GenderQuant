Beth Needham  works the graveyard shift at a gas station, and is becoming increasingly fed up with her job. To pass the time, she listens to a late-night radio show hosted by Dr. Lindsey Roland . One night, she musters up the courage to call into the show and she is encouraged to make some changes in her life and to call back in a few weeks to update the show's listeners on he progress. It doesn't take long for Beth to quit her job, threatening her boss with a knife while she's doing so. She then murders her mother by depriving her of oxygen. She despises her bed-ridden mother because she made her work long hours to support her and chastised her when she quit. After the mother dies, Beth finds out that she had more than $80,000 worth of a stock in her portfolio, and becomes even more enraged that she was forced to work for her even though she had plenty of money. Beth becomes even more obsessed with the talk-show host and, after unsuccessfully trying to reach Lindsey again at the station, she tries to reach her at her psychiatry office. She then learns that Lindsey has an answering service and that its workers get to talk to the host all the time. Beth applies for a job at the answering service, but is rejected in favor of a woman who she believes is a more physically attractive candidate. She kills the woman when she's walking in the parking lot after work. Beth then gets a call informing her that she got the job by default. Beth's obsession with Lindsey grows even more once she establishes a relationship with her. She winds up babysitting her child -- drugging him to make him fall asleep -- and murders one of her other babysitters to get more time with her. And when one of her co-workers learns how disturbed she really is from her former boss, she kills her, too. When Lindsey starts becoming suspicious and growing hostile toward Beth, she gets kidnapped at gunpoint and taken on a road trip. She eventually manages to get free, and after a scuffle in which she grabs the gun, orders Beth  to back off. When she refuses and takes a threatening lunge, Lindsey shoots her stalker to death.
