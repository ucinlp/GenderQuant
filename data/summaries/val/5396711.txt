The film tells the story of missionary Nathaniel "Nate" Williamsen , taken to an island mission with his fiancee Sophie . Their ship, the Rona, is captained by the roguish Bully Hayes , who also takes a liking to Sophie. When Sophie is kidnapped by slave trader Ben Pease  "Nate" teams with Hayes in order to find her. The plot is essentially a set-up for a rousing series of Indiana Jones style action set pieces, including a sequence on a suspension bridge which greatly resembles the climax of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, though Nate and Hayes was released a year earlier.
