Art critic and forgery expert George Steele  is stopped by a policeman as he tries to break into the Manhattan Museum. He claims that he was in a train wreck. Police Lieutenant Cochrane , however, finds that there has been no recent wreck. Steele, unsure himself what happened, relates the bizarre events leading up to the present. A flashback ensues. Museum director Barton  reprimands staff member Steele over the style of his public lecture and is annoyed that he wants to demonstrate a forgery detection method by X-raying a masterpiece that was recently exhibited. Afterward, while having a drink with girlfriend and magazine writer Terry Cordell , Steele receives an urgent telephone call informing him that his mother has been taken to the hospital. He rushes to Grand Central Station and catches the last train. About forty minutes later, Steele watches helplessly as another train crashes head on with his. Cochrane reveals that Steele's mother was never taken to the hospital. Anxious to avoid a scandal, Barton pleads with Cochrane not to arrest the man. Stevenson, the curator, and Dr. Lowell ([[Ray Collins , a member of the museum's board of directors, vouch for Steele's character. In private, Traybin , a British art expert investigating the suspicious loss of a Gainsborough painting, tells the lieutenant he wants him freed , as he is uncertain if Steele is involved. Steele sets out the reenact the train ride, hoping to gain some clue of what is going on. He finds out that a drunk was taken off at the next station by two men. He informs Stevenson of his discovery. Steele begins to suspect that the Gainsborough supposedly lost at sea was actually a fake. Later, Stevenson calls Steele to tell him he has discovered something important and to meet him at the museum that night. When he arrives, however, he finds Stevenson dead. Spotted standing over the body by an employee, Steele flees. Although both Traybin and Cordell plead with him to turn himself in, Steele is determined to exonerate himself. When he learns that the shipment of another masterpiece, Durer's Adoration of the Kings , has unexpectedly been moved up several weeks, he sneaks aboard the ship. Finding a fire burning in the hold, he removes the painting from its crate, only to discover he has been locked in. Fortunately, the ship's crew arrive to put out the fire. Steele escapes from Cochrane by shimmying down the anchor chain. He gets Mary, a young museum secretary, to get her friend to let him into a building with an X-ray machine. There, he confirms that the work is a fake. However, as he, Cordell and Mary are leaving, he is knocked out and Mary pulls a gun on Cordell. When Steele awakens, he finally meets the mastermind behind all his troubles: Dr. Lowell, who explains that, as a frustrated art lover, he could never own such fabulous works legitimately. Lowell uses a drug on Steele to disprove Cordell's story that he telephoned the police.  Lowell and Mary wait for a passing scheduled train to mask the sound of gunshots, but Traybin and the police intervene, and Lowell is shot just in time.
