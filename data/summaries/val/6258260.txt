Heleen practises tongue kissing first on her arm, then on another girl who is her friend, then does it with boys. On holiday in France she likes a French boy Bernard . However, when she tells him she loves him, she is uncomfortable with the bold way he starts touching her. Axel  is a childhood friend who is in love with her. However, Heleen is more interested in Axel's English friend Steve . Heleen is torn between her mother's statement that sex is like eating a sandwich, and Steve's that "sex should be like a voyage to the sublime, without true love no sublime". Steve rejects sex with Heleen. Encouraged by Steve and Axel, Heleen smokes some cannabis, but she does not really like it. Also her mother Quinta  encourages her to do it. She also encourages Heleen to give Axel a kiss; after all, they had a fake marriage as young children. Provocatively Heleen gives Axel an elaborate tongue kiss in Quinta's presence. Quinta asks Heleen not to walk around the house in only underpants: it makes her new lover uncomfortable. Indignantly Heleen shows her little brother her bare breasts and asks whether he is shocked. However, he does not care, he is indifferent to them. Axel threatens to commit suicide if Heleen refuses to have sex with him. She masturbates him . With the consent of her mother and after getting hormonal contraception drugs, Heleen has intercourse with Axel. She thinks it is okay, not very great, but anyway she is glad to have done it.
