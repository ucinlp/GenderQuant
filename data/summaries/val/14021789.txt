Sanders is a British colonial District Commissioner in 1930's Nigeria. He tries to rule his province and the various tribes comprising the Peoples of the River fairly. He is regarded with respect by some and with fear by others, known as 'Sandi' and 'Lord Sandi'. He has a ally in Bosambo, a literate and educated chief, but when Sanders goes on leave, another chief, King Mofolaba, spreads the rumour 'Sandi is Dead'. Intertribal war seems inevitable and the situation is made worse by gun-runners and slavers. 'Lord Ferguson' his relief, is unequal to the task, so Sanders returns to restore peace. Bosambo's wife Lilongo is kidnapped, and Bosambo furiously tracks down her kidnappers. Captured himself, he is about to die when a relief force, commmanded by Sanders, arrives to save them, and Mofolaba is killed by Bosambo.
