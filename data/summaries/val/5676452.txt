Snipes plays a marksman  who is sent as a specialist  to stop Chechen rebels that have taken over a to-be-decommissioned nuclear power plant from using it as a dirty bomb. Their mission is made all the more delicate by intelligence indicating a group of American specialists had been taken hostage within the nuclear power plant compound and that they must complete their mission before the rebels can reactivate the core of the remaining reactor. Finishing the mission with ease, rescuing two hostages and reaching the evacuation zone the team prepares to move out. Snipes, having been detained when placing the beacon inside the reactor realises that his mission was far too easy and it may be compromised.
