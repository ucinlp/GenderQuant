A rich man bets 1 million, with his son, that the "simple" choir-girl Aurora and the son, can stay together for a month, without any arguments whatsoever. Some surprising jealousy tricks are used from both camps. And that fact, plus Kai Normann Andersen's important work with the songs, that became evergreens, makes the film worth seeing even today.
