Young Alice, having become a celebrity for her adventures in Wonderland, is in her bedroom dreaming about visiting Paris and sharing adventures with story book girl, Madeline. A talking mouse named François rides a bicycle into Alice’s bedroom and wants to conduct a survey about her favourite cheeses. Alice wants to join François in his native Paris, so François uses a cheese that his company makes, which uses the same magical mushroom she ate in wonderland as an ingredient, to shrink Alice to rodent size. Together, they ride through Paris, where François narrates a series of short stories with a Parisian theme. In the end, when Alice finally meets her, it turns out that Madeline dreams of being Alice in wonderland.
