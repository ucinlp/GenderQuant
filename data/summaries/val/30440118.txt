Mary Wilson was born and raised in Texas, but by the time she became an adult she'd grown tired of her off-the-wall family and moved to Los Angeles to build a career for herself. Mary is an expert baker who has opened an upscale bakeshop, but a bad review and so-so sales causes her landlord to give her an eviction notice because she is behind on rent. Desperate to keep the store open, Mary decides to bite the bullet and go back to Texas with her fiancé Brent, introduce him to her folks, and hope their engagement gifts will bring enough cash to pay off her creditors. However, a severe allergic reaction prevents Brent from going. Mary can't afford to postpone the trip, so she brings along Brent's twin brother Jake, an irresponsible actor, to impersonate her fiancé. Jake wins the heart of Mary's family, and they both develop feelings for each other. Lucy, Mary's childhood friend, tries to seduce Jake as she knows about the whole reality, but Jake has fallen for Mary. Brent shows up at the engagement party and takes Mary back to LA, where Mary's bakery becomes a success after her grandfather gifts her the award-winning recipes he and his wife collected over the years. While setting a wedding date, Brent realizes that they are not made for each other. At last Mary confesses her love to Jake, and they get married.
