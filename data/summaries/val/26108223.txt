After being released from prison after six years, ex-convict Brett Hanson becomes lost in a new and unfamiliar world of freedoms and responsibilities. Struggling to reconcile himself with his disastrous past, he embarks on a journey to his home of Southern Louisiana to reunite with the ex-wife he left behind, May . Along this journey, he meets two teenagers: Martine , a troubled 15-year-old who has just escaped her family, and Gordy , a geeky outcast desperately seeking acceptance. Martine and Gordy offer to give Brett a lift home, and on the ensuing road trip the three reflect on their own personal misfit status while discovering in themselves and each other the acceptance each so deeply desires. Brett weighs whether to start a new life or rekindle his love with May -- he's not sure she'll take him back -- while Martine reevaluates her relationships with boys and her family and Gordy struggles with his affection for Martine.
