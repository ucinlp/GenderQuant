Sam Bell is nearing the end of a three-year work contract at Lunar Industries' largely automated "Sarang" lunar base, where he is the sole resident. Sam oversees automated harvesters and launches canisters bound for Earth containing the helium-3 they extract. Chronic communication problems limit him to occasional recorded messages with his wife Tess, who was pregnant with their daughter Eve when he left. His only companion is an artificial intelligence assistant named GERTY, who assists with the base's automation. Two weeks before he is to return to Earth, Sam suffers from hallucinations of a teenage girl. One such hallucination distracts him while he is out recovering a helium-3 canister from a harvester, causing him to crash his rover into the harvester. Rapidly losing air, Sam dons his helmet in time, but still loses consciousness from his injuries. Sam awakes in the base infirmary, but with no memory of the accident. He overhears GERTY receiving instructions from Lunar Industries not to let him outside the base and to wait for the arrival of rescue team "Eliza". He manufactures a fake problem with the base to force GERTY to let him outside. Inside the crashed rover he finds another, unconscious Sam Bell. After bringing this Sam back to the base and tending to his injuries, the two Sams start to wonder if one is a clone of the other. They get into a heated argument and physical altercation, but soon work together to coerce GERTY into revealing that in fact they are both clones of the real Sam Bell, who is on Earth. GERTY had awakened a new clone after the rover crash and implanted the memories of the real Sam Bell, believing that the original clone could not be recovered. The two clones start exploring the base. They find out that communications are being jammed by antennae at the far edges of the base, and that previous clones have all started to deteriorate and become very ill after about three years of being revived -- upon which, believing they were being put into hibernation for the journey home, were simply incinerated. They also discover an enormous vault containing hundreds more clones below the base. The older Sam drives past the interference range in another rover and calls Tess on Earth, only to get Eve, now 15 years old, who informs him that Tess had died years before. He hangs up before the real Sam can answer. The Sams realise that the incoming rescue team will kill them both if they are found together. The newer Sam suggests sending the other to Earth in one of the helium-3 canisters, but the older Sam, already in an advanced state of deterioration, knows he will not live much longer and instead suggests the newer Sam go and alert the public to what Lunar Industries is doing. The older Sam plans to return to the crashed rover and die there, so Lunar Industries will not suspect anything. They work with GERTY to erase all records of the second clone, and then revive a third clone to await the Eliza rescue team. They also program one of the harvesters to crash into a jamming antenna to enable communication with Earth. The older Sam, back in the rover, watches as the canister taking the other Sam is launched to Earth, before blacking out. As the credits roll, news broadcasts report that the clone's testimony about Lunar Industries' illegal activities stirred considerable controversy on Earth, causing the company's stock to crash.
