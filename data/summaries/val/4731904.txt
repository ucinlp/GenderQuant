In Seattle, straight-laced Matt Leland  falls in love with Casey Roberts , the new girl at their high school who is from Chicago. They begin a sexual relationship. His father disapproves of this and her parents try to stop the young couple from continuing to see each other. She deliberately sets off the fire alarm at school, knowing that there is no fire there, and is subsequently suspended from school. She has an argument with her parents when they tell her they are sending her to a boarding school. She takes an overdose and her parents subsequently arrange to have her committed. He helps her escape from an acute psychiatric ward, and as they run away they both deal with her borderline personality disorder. Casey is eccentric in nature. Her impulsiveness and extreme risk-taking attitude and behavior is attributed to her illness, in which she experiences severe highs and lows of emotion. Her frequent intense feelings, of passion towards Matt and of fear and destructiveness, dominate her persona. Throughout the relationship, Matt selflessly puts her needs before his. The severity of this increases as her mental state worsens. Heading toward Mexico in his SUV, Casey becomes increasingly reckless and over-emotional. They crash and abandon the vehicle. They hitchhike, accepting a lift from a salesman . He puts his hand on her crotch, she puts her lit cigarette against his face. He throws her out and a fight ensues between him and Matt. The couple steal his car and continue their journey. She becomes more distressed and he does his best to help her. He becomes scared, and after she threatens suicide, and also threatens to kill him, with a gun she took from the glove compartment in the salesman's car, they return to Seattle and their families, where she is readmitted to the psychiatric hospital. He goes home and much later receives a letter from her telling him she has moved back to Chicago and now feels significantly better. She says she has good memories of their time together.
