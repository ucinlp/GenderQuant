The documentary generally portrays the band by uncommon insight into their double-tracked lifestyle in an ironical and satirical way, not to discredit them but to reveal the common issues of a rock band and the often-stereotyped musical genre they are attributed to . Some scenes are visibly based on the artwork of the Truckfighters Mania record, which was also designed by the filmmakers Joerg Steineck and Christian Macijewski. The film has a total runtime of 83 minutes and is subdivided into 9 chapters: # Common # How To Get Things Done # Road # Home # Issues # The Body Burden # Family Fights # Big # The Drummer Dilemma
