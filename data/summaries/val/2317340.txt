Picking up one day after the events of Friday the 13th Part 2, the horribly deformed mass murderer Jason Voorhees has survived his attack at the hands of Paul Holt and Ginny Field and has migrated to a store where he has to steal new clothes. He then murders the store owners, Harold, with a meat cleaver slammed into his chest, and his wife, Edna, with one of her own knitting needles through the back of her head, before moving on to a nearby lakefront property called Higgins Haven. At the same time, a girl named Chris Higgins, who was attacked by a mysterious, disfigured stranger in the woods near Crystal Lake two years earlier, returns to the property with her friends Debbie, Andy, Shelly, Vera, Chuck, and Chili. After meeting Abel, an inebriated, religious fanatic who warns them to turn back, the gang meets Chris' boyfriend Rick at their destination . Chris intends to face her fears, however none of her friends know that an unmasked and reclusive Jason has taken refuge in the barn to recover from his battle wounds. The gang runs into trouble with some local bikers, Fox, Loco, and Ali, who then try vandalize their property. However, they are dispatched one by one by Jason before they can do any real damage - except for siphoning gas from Chris's van. Fox is impaled through the throat by a pitchfork, next, Loco gets another pitchfork through the stomach, and thirdly Ali is clubbed with a pipe wrench. When Chris and Rick go out for a drive, Jason emerges. He slits Shelly's throat and takes his hockey mask. Now, masked to cover his hideously deformed face, he then proceeds to murder the rest of the gang. He shoots Vera in the eye with a spear gun. While Andy is handstand walking, he looks up as Jason slashes him with a machete, splitting him in half. Debbie has a knife shoved through her neck while she rests on a hammock. Chuck enters the basement when the power dies and is thrown on a fuse box and electrocuted. Chili then gets impaled through the stomach with a red hot fire poker. Chris and Rick return to find the place empty and split up to see what's going on. Chris goes outside to call out to Rick, but Jason keeps his hand held over his mouth just a few feet away. Rick is then killed by Jason who squeezes his head until one of his eyeballs pops out. Jason then attacks Chris, chases her around the property, and into the barn. Chris hits Jason in the head with a shovel which knocks him temporarily unconscious, long enough to place a noose around his neck and roll him off outside the barn, hanging him. When Chris goes back down and opens the barn door, to her surprise, Jason has survived the hanging. Jason raises his mask up so he can take the noose off of his neck, and showing his real face to Chris, at which point she recognizes him as the man who attacked her two years earlier. As Jason proceeds to attack Chris, one of the bikers, Ali, who has survived his clubbing earlier, attempts his revenge, but Jason cuts off his hand and proceeds to hack him. With Jason distracted, Chris picks up an ax and strikes him in the head, apparently killing him. Chris then wanders over to the lake and falls asleep in a canoe that drifts into the middle of the lake. The next morning, Chris wakes up and sees Jason unmasked and alive staring at her through an upstairs window in the house. When he spots her, he runs out to attack her but as Chris tries to escape, she is grabbed and taken into the water by a decomposing Pamela Voorhees . It is revealed that this was all a nightmare, and at some point later, the police take a clearly mentally disturbed Chris off the property as the camera shows Jason's supposedly dead body. The final shot is of the lake finally at peace.
