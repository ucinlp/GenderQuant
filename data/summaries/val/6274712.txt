After England and Spain make peace, notorious pirate Henry Morgan  decides to reform. As a reward, he is made Governor of Jamaica, with a mandate to rid the Caribbean of his former comrades, by persuasion or force if necessary. He replaces the former governor, Lord Denby , but is not trusted by either the lawful residents or the pirates. Captain Jamie Waring  and his lieutenant, Tom Blue ([[Thomas Mitchell , reluctantly give up their "trade" out of friendship for Morgan, but others of the Pirate Brotherhood, such as Captain Billy Leech  and Wogan , refuse to change. Meanwhile, Waring takes a liking to Denby's daughter, Lady Margaret , who happens to be inconveniently engaged to an English gentleman, Roger Ingram . As it turns out, her fianc√© is secretly providing information about ship sailings to the unrepentant pirates. When Morgan is unable to stop the depredations of his old shipmates, he is suspected of still being allied with them. It is up to Waring to set sail to get to the bottom of things .
