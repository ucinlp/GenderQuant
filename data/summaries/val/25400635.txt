In a Parisian nightclub, party man Ludo  takes off late at night on his scooter, where he's blindsided by a truck. Lying between life and death in the hospital, Ludo is visited by his band of longtime pals, who decide that the gruesome crash should not prevent them from embarking on their coveted summer holidays. Prior to the trip, another major problem arises when one of the friends, osteopath Vincent , confesses his attraction to nervous-wreck restaurateur Max ; their initial tête-à-tête is one of the film's comic highlights. Both are married, and Max clearly isn't game, so when they arrive later with their families at his pristine seaside cottage, tensions are sky-high. The group's stress level is further goosed by pot-smoking rebel Marie , lovesick actor Eric  and the even more lovesick Antoine , all of whom are suffering from failed or failing relationships.
