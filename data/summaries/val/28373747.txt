From the official website : FESTED: A Journey To Fest 7 is a documentary film about the yearly punk music festival held in Gainesville, Florida simply called The Fest. It was filmed over two weeks spent in Gainesville around Fest 7 in 2008. The film follows Gainesville's SPANISH GAMBLE  and friends on their quest to play and experience the epic weekend-long festival that has been called things like "punk rock christmas", "a big, drunk, punk rock, bearded, tattooed family reunion", and "the last true home of punk rock". In the spirit of Penelope Spheeris' Decline Of Western Civilization series, FESTED features interviews, performances, and who-knows-what from over 20 bands... The artwork for the DVD was designed by Craig Horky, who also designed similar artwork for Spanish Gamble&#39;s debut album, &#34;It&#39;s All Coming Down&#34;. There are about 20 bands in the film either performing, being interviewed, or having a recorded track included: 10-4 Eleanor, American Steel, The Anchor, Dear Landlord, The Falcon, The Flatliners, Fleshies, Grabass Charlestons, Hour Of The Wolf, Lagrecia, LaSalle, The Lawrence Arms, New Mexican Disaster Squad, None More Black, Off With Their HEads, OK Pilot, Paint It Black, Spanish Gamble, Static Radio NJ, Tiltwheel, and Umoja Orchestra. Throughout the film the band Spanish Gamble plays a leading role, though at the time they were known as Dirty Money. The film was principally shot by Reese Lester and Tyler Neil, with National Underground also contributing some of their concert footage from The Fest.AMP Magazine interview with director Reese Lester
