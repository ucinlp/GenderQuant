Following an argument with a work superior, furniture designer Jim Fletcher quits his job in a fit of pique. He decides that England has nothing to offer him and the future for his family is in Australia. He eagerly sets about making emigration plans, and despite the fact that his wife and family are less than enthusiastic about moving to the other side of the world, he disregards their reservations and presses ahead. Practical and bureaucratic hitches continually threaten to derail the project. Jim must also deal with the opposition of his in-laws, finds himself missing his job, and starts to have doubts himself about the wisdom of the move. However the snags and pitfalls are finally sorted out and a firm departure date is set. Then two days before they are due to leave, the Fletchers' daughter meets, and instantly falls in love with, her ideal man. A good deal of heart-searching ensues before the Fletchers decide whether or not to go ahead with emigration.
