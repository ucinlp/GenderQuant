The film tells of a sea captain's monomanical quest for revenge on a great white whale who has bitten off the captain's leg.  The film, just as The Sea Beast, is an extremely free adaptation of the novel Moby-Dick by Herman Melville. It implements a prequel and sequel element to the story that did not exist in Melville's novel. For example Captain Ahab is seen as a handsome, romantic hero with a pretty girlfriend and both legs before embarking on the odyssey to kill the whale that later maimed him. Ahab survives the ordeal and returns home to the woman who loves him.
