Elderly, eccentric Miss Pudd  is the owner of a store she considers an antique shop but most would call a junkyard. She frequently refuses to part with her merchandise because of its sentimental value, but she does agree to sell some items to two small boys, Alby  and Chris , who are repairing a hot air balloon that belonged to the older boy's grandfather, a stunt man named The Great Sandusky. They plan to take the balloon aloft to celebrate the man's birthday. When the balloon is accidentally launched, untethered, with the two boys and their English sheepdog in the basket, Miss Pudd chases after them in her antique car, and manages to wind up riding the anchor dangling from the bottom of the basket. After she is pulled up, the balloon continues to drift south to San Francisco, where a police helicopter shoots it down. The balloon lands on the stage at an outdoor concert where an orchestra is playing the 1812 Overture.
