The "three smart guys" in this film are Mickey, Froggy, and Buckwheat. They devise a scheme to play hooky from school and go fishing. They misbehave in class in hopes that the teacher will expel them. But they are forced to stay after school instead. The next morning they decide to just play hooky and go fishing, but upon arriving at the river bank, the kids make the acquaintance of a friendly hobo , who advises them that they'll never hook the "fish" of success unless they return to school. Duly chastened, the boys rush off to the schoolhouse just in time for the first bell. All is forgiven.
