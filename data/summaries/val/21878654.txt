The episode starts at the Krusty Krab, when SpongeBob and Squidward get so hot because Mr. Krabs has not paid the electricity bill. It is so hot that SpongeBob's shoes have melted off his feet. When Mr. Krabs discovers that he has no customers, Squidward informs him that today, a lot people are visiting the beach, so Mr. Krabs has SpongeBob, Squidward and himself go to the beach at Goo Lagoon. Mr. Krabs has SpongeBob making Krabby Patties and himself doing what he normally does, counting money. When the trio are on one surfboard Mr. Krabs, Squidward and SpongeBob meet up with Patrick and Sandy. Patrick tries to climb onto the board, but he causes it to tip. Patrick starts swinging his arms and this causes the board to move uncontrollably. It collides with Sandy and a tidal wave suddenly sweeps the five friends up into separate places: SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward go to an island with young surfers, Mr. Krabs ends up stranded in the middle of the sea with his cash register "Cashie", and Sandy is taken to a small island in the middle of nowhere. SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward are told by the young surfers that the only way to get back to Bikini Bottom is to surf there; unfortunately they do not know how to. Despite the efforts of the surfers, SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward seem unteachable and don't seem to be taking anything in. Twitch, one of the surfers, tells them that there is one other person who can teach them to surf: Jack Kahuna Laguna  . SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward are told that they must sail down a river until they find the Kahmamoku Cove, "where every wave is perfect". After they find the cove, JKL comes out of his hut and surfs on an enormous surfboard which astonishes the three friends. Afterwards, he tells them, "just keep breathing." He later says that they have to ride a wave called "the Big One", in order to get back home. They practice surfing for some time, then get ready to ride "the Big One". Before they set off, JKL announces that "the Big One always demands a sacrifice. One of you... will not return." Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs encounters the Flying Dutchman at Dutchman's Triangle and Sandy goes on a search for the others on a helicopter she has built from supplies on her island.. The Dutchman is on the way back from the grocery store, but Mr. Krabs startles him and he spills everything into the water. He orders Mr. Krabs to give him Cashie's money so he can buy some more groceries, but Mr. Krabs is reluctant to let Cashie go. He promises that he will "never soil the Dutchman's waters again", swearing on his aunt Sally's false teeth. The Dutchman gets angry at this; he knows that Mr. Krabs' aunt Sally doesn't wear false teeth because he dated her in high school. Upon hearing this, Mr. Krabs releases Cashie and the Dutchman accidentally tosses it away. It crashes through Sandy's helicopter, causing it to fly off course and hit the Dutchman on the head. Cashie reappears from under the water, much to Mr. Krabs' delight. The Dutchman floats underneath the water and lands in Davy Jones' Locker (an actual [[Locker , where he encounters Davy Jones ([[Davy Jones , who throws dirty socks at him. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward ride the wave and they see Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs jumps up onto the board and drops Cashie into the ocean, so JKL goes to retrieve it and acts as the Big One's sacrifice. SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs and Squidward are seen flying on the surfboard and approach Goo Lagoon. Sandy's damaged helicopter crash-lands in Goo Lagoon, but some people at Goo Lagoon do not recognize her and think she is a spaceman. Sandy thinks that she will never see them again, but then they are seen walking along the sand, soaked. A "Welcome home" party has been thrown for SpongeBob and the gang and Twich, Chip and the other surfers are there too. JKL returns with Cashie, which he returns to Mr. Krabs. Everyone starts to party and then SpongeBob concludes the episode by shouting "Turn it up, Chip!".
