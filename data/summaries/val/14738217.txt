The Stooges are inept plumbers at Day and Nite Plumbers. Moe is busy reading "How to Be a Plumber" when the phone rings with a request to fix a leaky faucet at the home of the wealthy Norfleets . The leak happens to spring up while the Norfleets are throwing a dinner party to celebrate the acquisition of a $50,000 Van Brocklin painting. Moe struggles with the pipes in the basement while Shemp manages to trap himself inside a maze of pipes in the bathroom. Larry is assigned to finding the water cutoff and proceeds to dig up most of the lawn in an attempt to turn off the water. Shemp later surmises that the pipes fail to work properly because they are "clogged up with wires." Shemp and Moe proceed to remove the electrical system from the pipes and connect a water pipe to the freshly available pipe. The cook , who is in the kitchen trying to prepare an extravagant meal for the Norfleets, watches in bewilderment as the stove and chandelier gush water. "This house has sure gone crazy!", he exclaims. As the Norfleet's house transforms into Niagara Falls, two party guests named Mr. and Mrs. Allen ([[Kenneth MacDonald  manage to swipe the prized Van Brocklin painting. The Stooges manage, however, to catch onto the Allen's scheme and retrieve the painting. When the grateful Norfleets offer the Stooges a handsome reward, Shemp says they don't want the reward, Moe asks him what Shemp is saying, Larry agrees with Shemp and tells Moe they don't want anymore money. Shemp claims it would put them in a higher tax bracket and Moe proceeds to bracket Shemp's head and destroys the pipes in process in anger.
