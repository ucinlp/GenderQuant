 The respectable lives of Professor of English literature Thornton Sayre  and his daughter Carol  are severely disrupted when it is revealed that he was once a matinee idol known as "Dreamboat". His films are being shown on a television show hosted by his former costar Gloria Marlowe . The college administrators clamor for his resignation, but President Mathilda May Coffey  requests and is given discretionary power to decide what to do. In private, she admits to Thornton that she had been one of his biggest fans. Thornton hastily leaves for New York to get an injunction against the show, taking Carol along. There they meet Sam Levitt , the man responsible for airing the movies. While Sam and Gloria try to get Thornton to change his mind, Sam has underling Bill Ainslee  show Carol the sights. Undaunted, Thornton eventually gets his injunction, but his life is irreparably changed. He is fired after spurning Coffey's advances, and Bill and Carol have fallen in love and are planning to get married. When Gloria gloats over his setbacks, Thornton reveals that a major movie studio is interested in reviving his film career. Months later, Bill and Carol attend Thornton's premiere in Sitting Pretty - a real film starring Clifton Webb. Gloria then reveals to Thornton that she has bought his contract and is now his boss.
