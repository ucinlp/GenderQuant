A quiet night takes a dangerous turn when Julian  receives a frantic phone call from his best friend, Terry . Terry claims to have followed his unfaithful fiancée, June , to a seedy hotel on the other side of town. To make matters worse, he’s staked out the room across the hall from her, a bottle of whiskey in one hand and a revolver in the other. Julian pleads with his friend to stay put while he rushes to avert disaster. But is Terry truly as desperate as he sounds, or has Julian been playing into his hands all along? A full length feature remake was released in 2009.
