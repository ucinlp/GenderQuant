The film is set in contemporary New York City. Frank and Faye Riley , an elderly couple who run an apartment building and café in the run-down East Village neighborhood, come under threat by a nearby property development. The development manager, Mr. Lacey, under pressure from his corporate bosses to evict the tenants and start construction, sends a hoodlum named Carlos and his gang of thugs to bribe the couple and their tenants to move out. When the tenants resist, they punch through artist Mason Baylor's  door, intimidate pregnant single mother Marisa Esteval  and break retired boxer Harry Knoble's  jar of tiles. After Frank Riley refuses to move, Carlos vandalizes the café, breaking a sentimental photo frame in the process. With this assault and Faye's dementia growing , Frank contemplates giving in. Things look bleak until the appearance of a pair of flying, living machines , descend into the Rileys' apartment that evening, repairing many of the items that were broken and restoring the café. The two extraterrestrials take up residence in the shed at the top of the apartment building, where Faye  supplies them with metal objects to eat. The boarders debate the creatures origins, but Frank puts an end to the discussion by stating "the quickest way to end a miracle is to ask it why it is". Carlos comes back to threaten the tenants once again, the Fix-Its then lure him to the top of the building and into the shed where they scare him away by giving him an electric shock. Faye and Marisa learn that the "female" Fix-It is actually pregnant. After consuming plenty of metal and electrical objects, it gives birth to three baby Fix-Its, although one of them is stillborn. Faye buries the stillborn in a flowerpot the next day, but then Harry digs it back up takes it back to his apartment and succeeds in reviving it. Frank and Faye see a boost of business in the café from the demolition crew, while the Fix-Its help in the kitchen. Harry succeeds in resurrecting the dead machine, which returns to its family just as the other children are taught to fly. With Carlos unable to prove the existence of the Fix-Its that had been foiling their plans, Lacey is furious with the delays in evicting the tenants and moves to replace him. Desperate to see the job done and growing more unstable, Carlos breaks into the building's basement under cover of darkness to sabotage the building's pipework and electricity, and badly damages the "father" machine with a fire axe in the process. After Harry throws him out, the tenants discover the children are missing and go searching for them in the city while Faye stays behind with the "mother" machine as it fixes the "father". At first they don't have any luck but then Harry manages to summon the children with a dog whistle and megaphone, after which he laughs and comments "don't leave home without it". When the father machine is repaired, the now-wary Fix-It parents leave to seek out their offspring, and after finding them with Harry, the machine family departs from the planet. Tired of the delays, Lacey sends a professional arsonist to burn down the building in a staged "accidental fire". Carlos discovers the plan and in a rage sabotages the arson to make the entire building explode, only to then discover that Faye is still in the building. While the arsonist flees, Carlos unsuccessfully attempts to pose as her late son Bobby to get her to leave, but ends up rescuing her as the fire spreads. The tenants then return to find the blazing apartment block collapsing, and Faye being loaded into an ambulance. By the next morning, the apartment block has been reduced to a smouldering wreck. To Lacey's fury, construction is still unable to continue as Harry, sitting dejected on the steps, refuses to leave. Harry is then greeted by the mechanical family later that night, who have recruited countless other Fix-Its for repairs. By the next morning the entire building has been seamlessly restored to brand new condition, forever ending Lacey's demolition plans and resulting in his termination by his employers. Mason and Marisa settle into a relationship, while Carlos has ironically started a friendship with the Rileys, with Faye finally having come to accept her real son's passing. The movie then ends with a view of the restored and saved building in an unspecified future, flanked by towering post-modern skyscrapers.
