The movie starts with archeology students "Ben Wheelock  and Lark Rainwater  along with three or four unnamed characters blowing open a cave and unleashing a deadly creature that kills them all. 2 months later Dannielle "Danny" St. Claire  is a young woman who lives and works at an isolated outpost of the Forest Service in a remote national park. She is trying to move on from the recent death of her best friend, Julie Cassidy , in a tragic car accident. Danny blames herself for Julie's death since she was driving the car  when her friend was killed. As Danny settles into her new home and workplace with Julie's pet parrot "Hoppy", drowning her sorrows by drinking. When her boss Rick Bailey  calls her up on video chat, she covers her webcam with a bottle cap as Rick asks if she's drinking. That night, the creature tries to break into a shed, leaving claw marks all over the door; she tells herself that it's just a bear. The next day, her boyfriend, ranger Justin Rawley , shows up to keep her company as all the other rangers are putting out a fire. Later that night, they hear the creature on the roof setting off the alarm. Justin goes to the roof and finds the satellite dish damaged as the creature pushes his jeep off the road and down the hill, irreparably damaging the radio. The next day on the way to the radio room at the nearby dam, they hear something in the bushes but as Justin gets ready to shoot at it, Carl Nash  stops them, saying it's his wife Evelyn  they're about to shoot; the Nashes were campers that went missing the previous Sunday after losing their compass and maps in the river when their inflatable raft flipped over. Justin and Danny suggest that they all stick together, but Carl says he doesn't want to read in the newspaper that they were 'rescued by rangers' so he and Evelyn head out on their own. Justin and Danny enter the radio tower to find it trashed; meanwhile, Carl goes on ahead to check the trail. When Evelyn is killed by the creature, Carl hears her screams and turns back to check on her, and runs into the creature as it chases him and kills him. Justin and Danny goes back to the ranger station and find the jeep back on the road with the engine torn out. They find the station door lock torn off and as they enter, Evelyn's body, hanging from the ceiling by a chain, swings down triggered by the door opening. Carl's body falls off the roof on them and Justin suggests it was the same killer that killed the students two months earlier. Danny claims that the police searched the whole area but Justin suggest that the killer could've came back. After burying the Nashes, Justin attempts to head out on foot to get help while Danny stays at the ranger station. In the woods at night, Justin encounters the creature and it attacks and kills him. It then goes back to the ranger station and breaks the lock off the shed. The next day Danny sees the lock on the shed is broken and the door is ajar and finds Justin's head on a shelf behind some chemicals, and finds his body on the roof of the shed. Danny empties numerous food cans to tie them on strings to alert her for the creature's approach, and with the parrot's help in alerting her to the creature's proximity she manages to shoot and wound it. Danny discovers the creature has left a trail of green 'goo' and she follows the trail to the cave and runs into Joseph Riverwind , the teacher of the students killed previously. Riverwind explains everything he knows about the creature including some of its weaknesses, and that it is a demon drawn to Danny's negative energy and gives her a folder of information. Back at the ranger station Danny finds the Nashes' and Justin's bodies setting at the table with Justin's severed head on a plate. After burying the bodies again, it starts to rain and Danny remembers Riverwind saying the creature doesn't like water. She goes to hunt for it but when the rain stops, the creature attacks her, and eats some skin off her leg and then it takes off flying. Back in the ranger station, she finds the Nashes' cellphone and calls her boss Rick and tells him to bring the SWAT team but he dismisses her request because he believes she's been drinking. The next day, Rick arrives by himself. Danny acquires some dynamite sticks and they head out to track the creature to its lair. En route they find Riverwind's body impaled on a pole. As they get out of the jeep the creature flies by and drops Justin's headless body on Rick, killing him. Danny gets back in the jeep and goes after the creature, chasing it into the cave by driving the jeep full speed, then she lights the dynamite and gets ready to run. The dynamite explodes causing the cave to collapse, imprisoning the creature in the cave. She lays her ranger badge on the table before leaving the station. Danny tells the police ([[Sean Campbell  she doesn't know who murdered Justin and everyone else and then explains that she was driving in the accident that killed Julie, accepting responsibility for her friend's death.
