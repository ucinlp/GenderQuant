Doug Hutchison plays Bristol, a high-tech thief who masterminds a break-in to the Federal Gold Reserve in New York; while he uses his computer to shut down security, his assistant Jaster  grabs $40 million in bullion. When Bristol begins killing the guards, Jaster  flees with the gold. He buries it, then drinks and drives, gets caught for D.U.I.  and is put in jail. He lies low in jail so that Bristol will not kill him. Eventually, Bristol tracks him to prison; however, Jaster, who has a bad heart, for which he takes nitroglycerin, accidentally dies under interrogation. He tells Alvin Sanders , a petty con artist incarcerated for stealing shrimp, to tell his wife  to go to the Bronx Zoo, and that there's "no place like home". Treasury agent Edgar Clenteen, played by Morse, is determined to catch Bristol over the death of three of his men, so he decides to use Alvin as bait to lure out the killer. Making it seem as if Alvin knows the whereabouts of Jaster's gold stash, Bristol will go after Alvin, not knowing that he has a transmitter surgically implanted that allows Clenteen to track Sanders and listen to his conversations. The film ends when Bristol tries to kill Alvin and Lisa by planting a bomb in a delivery van at the race track, but Alvin intervenes and saves everybody at the track, while Bristol gets shot to death by Clenteen, making Clenteen a hero, and saving Alvin's life. Alvin even tells Clenteen the location of the gold: Yankee Stadium, also known as the Bronx Zoo.
