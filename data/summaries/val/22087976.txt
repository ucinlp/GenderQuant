The story takes place at a jousting field in medieval Canterbury, which features a joust competition between Sir Loinsteak and the black knight, Sir Cumfrence with a sportscaster-like announcer calling the action of the battle. The prize for this contest is the right to marry Princess Esmerelda. Due to a prebout accident, Sir Loinsteak is knocked out, leaving his sappy yet clever squire, Cedric, to take his place in the tourney. While Sir Cumference dominates the inexperienced simpleton early on, Cedric's clever and unorthodox improvisations tip the scales in the youth's favor. Finally after an assault with his lance, sword and mace, Sir Cumference collapses from exhaustion and Cedric wins by default. Princess Esmerelda leaps to her new fiancee with glee, Cedric soaks in the crowd adoration, while a serf nonchalantly pushes Sir Cumference from the field in a scoop shovel.
