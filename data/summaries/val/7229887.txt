Palo Alto is the story of four college freshman on their last night of Thanksgiving Break, their first time back since leaving for school. We follow them as they come to realize their small town, once seemingly boring and meaningless, has much more to offer then they ever expected. The film opens with Alec, Nolan, Patrick and Ryan sneaking into an old classroom to retrieve an item confiscated by a freshman high school teacher. Their conversation is interrupted when campus security discovers them. The friends dart through the halls of the school and manage to avoid capture. Now in front of Palo Alto High, the friends say their goodbyes for the evening. Alone and concerned his night will end with no excitement, Alec befriends an older fraternity brother, Anthony. The two quickly bond through mutual initiation stories, and the admiration Alec has for the more experienced partier. On a school bus, Morgan, in his twenty-fifth year as a bus driver, discovers his old passenger Nolan at a public bus stop. The two catch up and Morgan tries his luck as cupid by inviting a young girl on board . Nolan and Jaime continue, inventing adventures. Patrick is visiting Amy, his girlfriend of four years. Patrick attempts to explain his vision of the future, which, of course, includes Amy. She quickly cuts him off to break his heart and destroy his neatly planned life. When Ryan arrives at Audrey’s house, he expects to get some action and leave quickly. He is shocked to hear she wants more than a physical relationship. Disgusted with his reaction, Audrey steals his car – leaving him stranded with her Grandma. The two hit the streets in her aging automobile looking for Audrey. The four boy’s stories continue throughout the night, briefly intersecting, before the sun rises and they all leave home again.
