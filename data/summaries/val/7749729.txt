Dorothy  is a sixteen-year-old groupie riding with a rock band, Wally  and the Falcons. Suddenly, the van is in a road accident, and she hits her head. She wakes up in a fantasy world as gritty and realistic as the one she came from and learns she killed a young thug in the process. A gay clothier, Glin the Good Fairy , gives her a pair of red shoes as a reward to help her see the last concert of the Wizard , an androgynous glam rock singer. She is pursued by the thug's brother  who attempts to rape her on several occasions. She also meets a dumb surfer Blondie , a heartless mechanic Greaseball , and a cowardly biker Killer .<ref namehttp://detour-mag.com/assets/2008/05/02/cult-flick-20th-century-oz/ |titleDetour Mag |accessdate=2008-05-16 }}
