Two detectives, Jim Packard  and Doc Long , make the acquaintance of Jefferson Monk  in a nightclub they frequent. When a flaming desert is nearly spilled onto the trio, Monk informs them that it was meant for him. He explains that, according to a prophesy, he is to die in three days. Upon learning their profession, he hires them to protect him, particularly from a man with a peg leg and a valise, the latter  to transport his decapitated head to the ancient secret society of the Barokan. The leader of the society, Mr. Gee , has offered to buy Monk's head  because he looks exactly like the ancient mummified founder of his order. When the two trail Monk and his woman companion, Jean Anderson , out into the night, the one-legged man does approach, but eludes their efforts to catch him. As Packard delves into the mystery, he comes to suspect that someone is trying to drive Monk into committing suicide after he learns that Monk's two million dollar inheritance will go to charity if he divorces his wheelchair-bound wife Ellen . Along with Ellen, the suspects include her physician, Dr. Han ; her nurse ; her lover, Justin Reeves; Jean; and the minions of the society. Then the one-legged man has his throat cut. He is identified as Jean's father. Jean and Reeves soon suffer the same fate. It turns out that all of Monk's acquaintances, led by his wife, are plotting his death. However, he found out by bribing Dr. Han and started killing them off one by one. Fearing that Packard and Long will eventually figure out the identity of the murderer, Monk tries to dispatch them as well, but they manage to foil his scheme. Unmasked, Monk flees in his car, only to have a crash result in his decapitation.
