In 2002, filmmakers/musicians Haylar Garcia and Scott Baxendale began work on a screenplay, which takes place over 30 years in Rock & Roll history, and chronicles the true-life events of Scott Baxendale's life as a guitar maker. Baxendale and Garcia began the search for an actor to play the film's lead, eventually settling on Johnny Depp. As the fourth draft of the script became finalized in late 2004, Garcia and Baxendale decided to show Depp Baxendale's craftmenship by giving the actor one of his guitars. Over the course of the next few months, Baxendale built a custom design, solid-body electric guitar for Depp. In the rear of the instrument he built a special chamber, meant to house and display the film script. But then arose another problemâ€”how to deliver the guitar to Depp. With the help of their indie production team and Johnny Depp fans around the world, Garcia and Baxendale set out on a quest to hand deliver the guitar and script to Johnny Depp, all the while filming their journey.Do It For Johnny
