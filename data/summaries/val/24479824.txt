In 1968, B.O.B's birthday was celebrated. Dr. Cockroach gave him a cake made of a bucket, frosting, and inedible objects. Cockroach and the Missing Link tell B.O.B to make his wish while they are gone. Dr. Cockroach reveals that the cake he made has transformed B.O.B into a living atomic bomb. He says it will allow the both of them to escape . Cockroach is happy until he finds that B.O.B is right next to them. He tries to blow it out himself, but B.O.B absorbs it. The Chemical instead gave B.O.B the ability to read the minds of those whom he touches; revealed when he exposes the Missing Link's sarcastic reaction to the escape attempt and Dr. Cockroach's shame at the failed plan. Dr. Cockroach devises another plan: to read General W.R Monger's mind to find the escape vehicles and then use B.O.B's power to rule the world. A few minutes later, General W.R Monger was lured to the prison center where the monsters were playing a "game" based on The Travels of Marco Polo. Monger tells Cockroach that he has his commandos ready to strike. But the monsters say he has no need to worry. They tell Monger they have given up on trying to escape to let his guard down. B.O.B continues yelling out Marco, which annoys Monger. He yells out Polo and B.O.B. grabs him. General Monger reveals that there was a door behind a poster of him saying "I'm always watching you - always" and has the access code "1-2-3-4". He also reveals there are no commandos and he likes making funny hand signals. B.O.B starts to play tag. They try to escape, but General Monger shows up in a jeep to stop them. B.O.B changes the game to Red Light, Green Light. Dr. Cockroach tries to run, but Monger closes all the doors. B.O.B. then has bubbles, which read Monger's mind. He reveals there's a jumbo jet up on the roof that's fueled up and ready to go. Then they fly up in it, and B.O.B thinks the plane is a pinata. Link is excited to get outside, while Dr. Cockroach reveals that with B.O.B's new power the secrets of the world are theirs. Unfortunately B.O.B crashes the plane, and Monger greets them in a sarcastic matter; the explosion apparently also shuts down B.O.B.'s new mind-reading ability. They then continue the party with the Invisible Man, and B.O.B remarks, "This is the best birthday party ever!" and the monsters sigh.
