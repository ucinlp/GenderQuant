After it becomes evident that their marriage will not last, the two are divorced and Margo is remarried, this time to Rock ([[William Dozier , a California surfer. However, this marriage does not last long either and they are quickly divorced. Jake and Rock were previously introduced to each other by Margo and, after they are both divorced from her, they form a friendship and live as roommates. The two have very little in common except for the fact that they married and divorced the same woman. They become best friends, even though they constantly irritate each other, and they decide to write a film based on their experience of being married to Margo. During their work on the project, they meet many more people just like them whose lives were impacted by Margo.
