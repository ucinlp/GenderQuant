The film is based on the Aramoana Massacre that occurred over a period of two days on 13 November and 14 November 1990 in New Zealand. In the southern part of the South Island of New Zealand, just 17 miles north of Dunedin, the small coastal community of Aramoana stretches along a narrow sandy spit that pokes out into the mouth of New Zealand's Otago Harbour. The name Aramoana is Maori for "pathway to the sea". Aramoana is an idyllic and peaceful place to live; a beautiful coastal part of the Pacific rim, near where albatrosses come to roost  after their long global journey. But on 13 November 1990, Aramoana turns into hell on earth. Resident David Gray, an unemployed gun fanatic and collector, goes on a rampage in which he fatally shoots 13 people before being killed by police.
