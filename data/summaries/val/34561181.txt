The film begins with Geoffrey Griffin  in the midst of a camping trip with his estranged wife Jean Griffin  and children Randy  and Bob  at Yosemite National Park. His children and especially his wife are bored with the trip and uninterested in any family togetherness, despite his insistence. As the family is traveling back home, Griffin is driving the car while his wife and kids are being hauled in the camper behind him. He has a flashback to a doctor's visit where he is told that he has an inoperable form of terminal melanoma and will soon die, which is assumed to have been the motivating factor behind his initiative to take the trip, which his family had talked about doing before he and his wife separated. After becoming increasingly frustrated at his family's apathy about the trip, their reviling attitude toward him, and their trivial demands such as that he stop to walk the dog, he detaches his car from the camper and drives away, deserting them. Sarah Phoenix  is introduced as she is receiving news from her doctor that she also has a terminal disease, leukemia. She is in denial regarding the diagnosis, and following an angry outburst she consults another doctor who delivers the same information. Griffin is seen driving to Los Angeles, where he meets with his brother George  who updates him on his ex-wife and children and gives him $1,500 to spend at his leisure. Faced with his grim diagnosis, Griffin expresses his interest in a course entitled "Psychological Processes of Death and Dying", which he attends. Phoenix is also in attendance at this class, and it is where the two characters first meet. After class, Griffin asks Phoenix to meet him the following Wednesday night for dinner if she was interested. She is guarded and shows a lack of interest in developing a close relationship with Griffin due to her terminal illness, and instead of showing up for the date she spies on Griffin from the neighboring restaurant, where he spots her and invites her over. Griffin and Phoenix spend the next several weeks together falling in love and living their lives to the fullest, engaging in fun but outrageous and childish public behavior and constantly switching between an on-again and off-again relationship. Among their activities include sneaking into a movie theater, freighthopping, riding amusement park roller coasters and evading police after being caught painting messages on a water tower, where Phoenix writes "Class of '59" and Griffin secretly writes "Griffin Loves Phoenix" encased in a heart and arrow design. Neither knows that the other is also terminally ill until Phoenix discovers books related to cancer, death and dying in Griffin's apartment, and bursts out at him in rage under the mistaken assumption that he had been stalking her and knew she was terminally ill. She tries to run away, and when Griffin catches her and questions her they both learn of each other's shared impending deaths. Phoenix tells Griffin that when she becomes too ill to continue living a normal life, she will resign herself to a hospital and she does not want him to come and find her. That day finally comes; Griffin finds a note from Phoenix telling him that her pain was too unbearable, and that he should go spend time with his family and remember his promise not to try and find her. Distraught, Griffin seeks her out and finally finds her after searching at over a dozen hospitals, where he sits by her bedside and they comfort each other. Unable to handle the emotional distress of Griffin's presence, Phoenix asks him to leave, which he does, presumably never to return before her death. We then see Griffin browsing a cemetery, where he finds Phoenix's gravestone that under her name and dates of birth and death reads: "P.S. â€“ Hi Griffin. Thought you'd probably drop by". The film ends as we see a maintenance man painting over Phoenix's and then Griffin's water tower messages.
