Dodie lives with her parents and dreams of marrying a millionaire. At home in California, near the ocean, her boyfriend Buzz is a real-estate agent of modest means. He proposes marriage and she accepts, but tells her pal Marge that she has doubts. A yacht arrives, owned by wealthy Neil Patterson, which gets Dodie's fantasies going. She even leaps into the water and swims out to meet him. Asked on a date, Dodie is thrilled until she learns that the man isn't Neal at all but his poor mechanic, Pete. It isn't long before Pete is smitten and proposes. He also infuriates Buzz by pretending to buy a house and bringing Dodie along as his fiancee. A drunk Neil has an accidental meeting with Dodie and invites her onto the yacht. At first she's annoyed by his advances, but in Tijuana she gets tipsy and has a great time. Neil is the rich suitor she's been dreaming about, one who even buys a taxi rather than just hailing a ride from one. After being out till 4 a.m., Dodie is brought home by Neil, only to find Buzz and Pete impatiently waiting on her doorstep. Asking time to sleep on a decision, Dodie tells them the next morning that she has made her choice: Neil. The guys reluctantly accept, and Dodie goes off with her new betrothed. But the minute Pete kisses her goodbye, she promptly changes her mind.
