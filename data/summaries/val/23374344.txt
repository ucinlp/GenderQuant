Annika Bengtzon, an up-and-coming young reporter for Kv√§llspressens newspaper, is called to the scene of a possible terrorist attack on the new Olympic Arena, Victoria Stadium in Stockholm, where the northern part of the arena has been blown to pieces. The blast kills Christina Furhage, the Swedish Olympic ambassador, and Bengtzon soon finds out that the bombing may been a personal attack against Furhage and not a terrorist attack. Soon more Olympic Arenas around Stockholm are attacked and there are more victims, just months away from the Summer Olympics. A bomber with a personal agenda is on the loose.
