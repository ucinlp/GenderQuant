Evil forces dominates the world. The wicked prosper, as the good are made to suffer as a result of the vicious impact of the spirit of the times, the Kaliyuga, presided over by Kali Purusha. Great rishis hold yagas under the guidance of sage Kshyapa to get rid of the world from this wickedness. Sage Bhrigu  went to Lord Maha Vishnu  to request his help. He did not notice the sage's arrival while enjoying the blissful company of his spouse Sri Lakshmi . Furiously, the sage kicked the Lord on the chest. Vishnu without being offended at all pacified the sage and made him realize how anger makes people lose their sense. Sri Lakshmi, however, could not bear all this. In great anger, She left Vaikuntam for the earth below. In search of her, Sri Vishnu too came down to the earth. He took shelter as Srinivasa in the ashram of Vakulamatha . Later, however, Srinivasa met Padmavathi , daughter of Akashraja and married her.
