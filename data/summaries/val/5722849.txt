Most of the film takes place in a continuing flashback of one fateful night in 1967 at the Flower Palace Nightclub. On the night of the Hong Kong 1967 Leftist Riots, Butterfly Yiu was given an accidental chance to perform the final show when the original and star performer, Pak Long, was stranded at another venue. This started a chain of events that will change the four character's lives forever. The beginning and the end of the movie takes place in modern times, and Butterfly returns from retirement in Canada to perform in a final charity show at the Flower Palace Nightclub before it is demolished.  Out of the four main characters, only Butterfly became very famous, and had a long career as a singer and actress. She had financial security, but lost out on romance, as her love interest, Karl Sum, cannot bear the pressure and relative shame of living with someone who is much more popular. Karl left for New York to start a new career, only to be reunited with Butterfly at the end of the movie. This ending differs from the adapted ATV series, as although Butterfly and Karl meet again, she cannot forgive him for leaving her. Lulu Kim also became popular as a singer and actress, but not on the same level as Butterfly. Lulu eventually was married to Luk Tat Sun, the son of one of the directors of the Flower Palace Nightclub. He originally sought to marry Butterfly, but she waited out for Karl, and refused his advances. Fung Ping continues her unlucky streak in romance. She followed Donny, her gambling-addict boyfriend, to Vietnam with a show tour team. She arrived in Vietnam at the height of the Vietnam War, and was presumably killed during a bombing raid by US Forces. She gave birth to a son while in Vietnam, despite earlier promises of an abortion, and Karl Sum adopted the son and took him to the US. He was united with Butterfly at the end of the movie. Nancy eventually sought another job at another nightclub as a lounge singer. She remained obscure, and became depressed and an alcoholic. She eventually lost her voice due to alcohol and died of cirrhosis. Butterfly only knew of this right before her charity show.
