The film consists of two subplots. The first tells about the life of the writer Jules Verne and the history of creation and publication of the novel In Search of the Castaways. The second actually narrates the novel. Lord and Lady Glenarvan found in the sea a bottle with a letter from Captain Grant, whose ship was wrecked. After the refusal of the British government to conduct searches, The Glenarvans decide to find captain Grant themselves with Grant's children Mary and Robert.
