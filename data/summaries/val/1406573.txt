The tiny fishing village Ste-Marie-la-Mauderne on the north coast of Quebec is in decline, and everyone collects welfare. In order to lure a company to build a plastic container factory in the area, they need to have about twice their population of 120 and a resident doctor, as well as a $50,000 bribe for the company owner. Montreal plastic surgeon Dr. Christopher Lewis  gets pulled over for speeding by an officer originally from Ste-Marie-la-Mauderne, and in exchange for not arresting Dr. Lewis for drug possession, he convinces Dr. Lewis to visit Ste-Marie-la-Mauderne for a month. A deleted scene showed Dr. Lewis selling cocaine to his patients. The town Mayor Germain Lesage  hatches a plan for the entire village to convince Dr. Lewis to stay, tapping his phone, taking him fishing, pretending to like cricket, fusion jazz, and the foods Dr. Lewis likes. A local banker leaves small amounts of money for Dr. Lewis to find and attempts to secure a loan for the bribe. Dr. Lewis likes the local post office worker Ève Beauchemin , but Ève knows Dr. Lewis has a girlfriend named Brigitte in Montreal. The ruse works, but they are unable to secure a loan. Local banker Henri Giroux  fronts the money from his personal savings after being told by a bank executive he was nothing more than an ATM. When the company owner arrives, the town continues their elaborate ruse and convinces him to build the factory there. The owner is ready to sign but insists that they have a doctor. Dr. Lewis learns that Brigitte has been having an affair with his best friend for three years and says he plans to stay because everyone in the village is genuine. Germain feels bad for lying to him and confesses their ruse during a heartfelt speech explaining that a doctor in residence would save Ste-Marie-la-Mauderne. Dr. Lewis decides to stay, and the factory is built, saving the village and giving everyone renewed pride.
