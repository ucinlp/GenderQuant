Tobin Frost , an ex-CIA NOC operative turned international criminal, acquires a data storage device from rogue MI6 agent Alec Wade ([[Liam Cunningham . Attacked by a team of mercenaries led by Vargas , Wade is killed and Frost is forced to surrender himself to the American consulate in Cape Town, South Africa. Frost is transferred to a local safe house maintained by "housekeeper" Matt Weston , a low-level agent. Weston watches veteran agent Daniel Kiefer  begin to interrogate Frost via waterboarding. Vargas and his men attack the safe house, killing Kiefer and his team, as Weston manages to escape with Frost as his prisoner. Weston contacts his superior, David Barlow , at CIA headquarters in Langley. Catherine Linklater , another CIA operative, orders Weston to lie low and await instructions. Weston hides out with Frost and calls his girlfriend Ana Moreau , a French medical resident who does not know that he works for the CIA, and tells her to leave the house. Barlow later tells Weston to go to Cape Town Stadium to retrieve a GPS device with the location of a nearby safe house. He retrieves the GPS at the stadium, but Frost creates a diversion and escapes by disguising himself as a policeman. Weston, detained by the police, escapes but can't catch Frost. Weston is ordered to visit the nearest American embassy for debriefing. Instead he meets with Ana, where he reveals that he is a CIA agent and sends her back to Paris for her safety. He is able to track Frost to a shantytown in Langa, where Frost is meeting Carlos Villar , an old contact and document forger. Vargas attacks again and kills Villar, but Frost is able to escape with Weston's help. They learn that Vargas is actually working for the CIA, which is seeking to retrieve the storage device Frost received from Wade. The device is revealed to contain details of the corrupt dealings of the CIA, MI6, Mossad, and other intelligence agencies, and that Weston's own superiors may be implicated. Frost is taken to the new safe house by Weston, where Weston is attacked by the housekeeper, Keller . After much struggle, Weston kills Keller but is badly wounded in their fight. Frost leaves Weston who then passes out from the wounds sustained fighting Keller. Meanwhile, Linklater has arrived in South Africa with Barlow to collect Frost and Weston from the safe house, but on the way is shot and killed by Barlow, who goes to the safe house and reveals that he is Vargas' employer. He confirms that the file contains incriminating evidence against him, and encourages Weston to lie about what has happened. Frost returns to rescue Weston by killing Vargas and his men but is shot by Barlow. Weston then shoots Barlow in the chest, killing him. Frost gives Weston the file and tells Weston he is better than him before he dies from his injuries. Back in the U.S., Weston meets with CIA Deputy Director Harlan Whitford , who informs Weston that unflattering facts about the CIA must be removed from his report, but that he will be promoted. He asks Weston about the file's location but Weston denies having been told about it by Frost. Whitford states that whoever has those files will have many enemies. Weston leaves, then leaks the files to the media, incriminating personnel from many intelligence agencies, including Whitford. Later on, Weston sees Ana across a street in Paris, France. She reads a note passed to her from him, looks up at Weston, and they both make eye contact before he disappears.
