Slade In Flame charts the history of "Flame" a fictitious group in the late 1960s who are picked up by a marketing company and taken to the top, only to break up at their zenith. The film begins with the future members of Flame playing in two rival bands, one with a singer named Jack Daniels , and the other, The Undertakers, fronted by Stoker . Flame are formed from the two bands, with Charlie  joining on drums, making up the same line-up as the real-life Slade. They are picked up by marketing man Robert Seymour  and with the help of publicity stunts the band's fortunes improve, but their former agent  stakes a claim to their earnings, and uses violence to try to get his way. The band members tire of the music business and the band breaks up.
