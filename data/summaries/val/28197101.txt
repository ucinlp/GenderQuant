Rawlings is initially resentful and bored by the apparent mundanity and lack of excitement of the life, until the vessel is called on to rescue the crew of an RAF bomber shot down in mid-Channel. Having accomplished the rescue, the boat runs into an enemy minefield during its return and is attacked by German air and sea forces. Murray is killed, and Rawlings must take charge and bring the vessel safely back to shore.
