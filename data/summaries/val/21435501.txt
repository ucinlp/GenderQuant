In New Guinea, an expedition led by Australian District Officer Steve McAllister heads up the Sepik River to a valley where the adventurer Sharkeye Kelly has discovered oil. The party includes United Nations doctor Louis Dumarcet and crocodile hunter Jeff Claton. Louise takes blood samples from small children and is attacked by a witchdoctor. The expedition risks being massacred but the children recover in time.
