Professor Lawrence Van Helsing  gives a lecture in 1904 at a Chongqing  university on Chinese vampire legend. He speaks of an unknown rural village that has been terrorized by a cult of seven known as 'Golden Vampires' for many years... He goes on to explain that a simple farmer, armed with a pitch-fork and who had lost his wife to the vampires, trekked his way to the temple of the vampires where he saw many other unfortunate woman strapped to tables waiting for their blood to be drained. The farmer burst in and battled the vampires. He is unsuccessful as his wife is killed in the fight. But in the chaos, he grabbed a bat-like medallion around one of the vampire's neck which he sees as the vampires life source. Defeated, the farmer flees the temple but the High Priest orders the vampires after him. No sooner have they left on horse-back, the priest summons the vampire's former victims: the 'Undead' from their graves to aid the seven vampires. Still carrying the medallion, the farmer places it around a small model of a Jade Buddha. He knocks desperately on the locked village gates but is in vain. The vampires and their undead catch up with him and kill him. However, one of the vampires spies the medallion around the buddha and goes over to collect it. The moment the vampire touched the Buddha, the creature is destroyed in flames. Van Helsing goes onto say that he is positive the village still exists and is still terrorised by the remaining six vampires. He is only unsure of where the village lies. Many students disapprove of the story and leave. After the lecture, a student named Hsi Ching informs him that the legend is true and that he knows the location of the village. He goes on to say that the farmer who killed one of the vampires was his grandfather. He proves his story by producing Van Helsing the dead vampire's bat-like medallion. He then asks Professor Van Helsing if he would be willing to travel to the village and destroy the vampire menace. Van Helsing agrees and embarks with his son; Leyland Van helsing, Hsi Ching and his seven kung-fu trained siblings on a dangerous journey funded by a wealthy widow named Vanessa Buren  who Leyland and two of Ching's siblings saved from the Tongs. On the journey, they are ambushed by the six remaining vampires in a cave along with the undead. The group are quickly engaged in battle and soon kill several of the vampires. The remaining beasts, sensing they are outnumbered, are quick to retreat, taking their army of undead with them. The following morning, the party reach the village, partly ruined but still populated, and prepare to make their final stand. They use wooden stakes as barriers and digging a large trench around them filled with  oil. In the temple that evening, Kah calls on the remaining vampires to kill Van Helsing and his party once and for all. The vampires ride on horseback followed by their army of undead to the village. The vampires reach the village and soon Van Helsing's group once again do battle with the last golden vampires and their undead resulting in nearly all their party being massacred. During the fight, Buren is bitten by a vampire and she quickly becomes one. She then seduces Ching and bites his neck. Knowing what he will become and what he has to do, Ching throws himself and Buren on a wooden stake killing them both. Elsewhere the remaining vampire captures one of Ching's siblings and takes her back to the temple to be drained. Seeing this, Van Helsings son, Leyland, steals a horse from one of the dead vampire's and pursues. The undead defeated, Van Helsing and his remaining party follow to help Layland at the temple. Having reached the temple itself, the vampire straps the sister to one of the altars. It is about to drain her when Layland leaps onto the creatures back and throws it to the ground before freeing the sister. However, the vampire comes round and attacks Layland throwing him onto one of the altars in the struggle. Leyland is about to be drained when Van Helsing and his group burst in. Van Helsing thrusts a spear into the vampires back, staking it. Dying, the last of the golden vampires stumbles and collapses into a vat of boiling blood where it quickly evaporates, leaving behind the bat-like medallion, its mask, a pile of dried blood and red dust. The party leave the temple, save for Van Helsing who feels a familiar atmosphere. Sure enough, a familiar voice barks from behind him. Van Helsing turns round to face Kah the High Priest. Recognizing the voice, Van Helsing realises that Dracula is using the form of the Monk to control the golden vampires and their undead. Van Helsing demands Dracula to show himself calling him a coward. Dracula reverts to his true form and attacks Van Helsing. In the ensuing struggle, Van Helsing succeeds in stabbing Dracula with a spear through the heart. Weakened, the Count collapses onto one of the altars and gradually decays to bones. The spear that killed Dracula is weakened and collapses, smashing the vampires skull. Soon, there is nothing left of of the Count, save for his dusty remains and the blood-stained spear. Van Helsing sighs with relief as the nightmare of Count Dracula is finally over.
