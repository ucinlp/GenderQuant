In the year 814, shortly after the death of Charlemagne, a woman called Joan is born in Ingelheim am Rhein. She is the daughter of a village priest  who had hoped for a son and is disappointed at the birth of a girl. He also rules his wife  and family with a rod of iron, though his Saxon wife still secretly worships the pagan god Wotan. Even so, Joan grows up to be an articulate girl keen on learning and persuades her older brother Matthew to teach her to read. She then intensively studies the Bible. After Matthew's sudden death, their father wants to send his second son John to the cathedral school in Dorestad, but when the teacher Aesculapius  visits them in Ingelheim, Joan proves to be far more capable of dealing with the scriptures than John, not only able to understand the Latin text but also of providing a proper interpretation of the parable of the mustard seed. Against her father's wishes, Joan is taught by Aesculapius, who introduces her to literary works such as Homer's Odyssey. When an inspector comes from the bishop to collect Joan to take her to the cathedral school, her father claims there has been a mistake and allows him to ride away with John. Joan flees her home at night and finds her brother, whose companion has been murdered. They reach Dorstadt together, where the bishop reacts to Joan's strong words with great surprise, and the teacher Odo  unwillingly takes her into his class. Count Gerold , however, supports the now-adolescent Joan by taking her into his home. There Gerold falls in love with her. Soon afterwards, Gerold has to go to war in the army of Lothair I and his wife Richilde  takes advantage of his absence to try to arrange a marriage for Joan and thus get rid of her rival for Gerold's affections. However, the Normans break into the city during the wedding ceremony and carry out a bloody massacre, which Joan barely manages to survive. Due to her experience of the massacre, Joan decides to assume a male disguise, cutting her hair short, binding her breasts and entering the Fulda monastery of Benedictines as "Brother Johannes Anglicus". There she is constantly afraid of being exposed as a woman, but she also impresses the other monks with her knowledge of medicine, managing to save an old woman and her children from a dangerous infectious disease. At the same time, they recognize the talent of the oldest son, Arn, and allow him to visit the monastery school. One day she is visited by her old father, who suffers a fatal heart attack on realizing he is face to face with Joan and not John. Shortly afterwards a fever spreads around the monastery; although Joan becomes ill during this time, she manages to avoid a physical examination, thanks to an elderly monk, who had realized she was a woman long before the fever hit. She flees the monastery and is received as a woman by Arn , who has become a manager for a count. Arn gives her temporary shelter and makes her a tutor to his daughter Arnalda. After a short time there, she decides to re-assume her male disguise and to go on a pilgrimage to Rome to use her medical knowledge to become a Medicus there. In Rome she wins a great reputation by curing pope Sergius II of gout with her herbal remedies and he makes her first his personal physician and then his Nomenclator. Finally, the pope threatens Lothair I for not confirming his election and Lothair marches to Rome with his army to subdue Sergius. Gerold also comes to town in the army's wake and recognizes Joan. Using a hydraulic device once built on a small scale by Joan and Gerold, the great door of the papal palace closes all by itself. Pope Sergius then threatens Lothair and his soldiers that if they do not give respect, God's wrath will be upon them. Lothair's soldiers take this as a sign from God and all of them kneel, with Lothair following. Fascinated by what he has seen, Gerold looks out and sees Joan. He follows her and he reveals his desire to Joan, but she is torn between her male and female identities. Meanwhile Lothair's ally Anastasius successfully plots to murder Sergius and the people gather to elect a successor by acclamation. Joan and Gerold expect Anastasius to be elected and plan to flee, but suddenly Joan discovers that it was, in fact, she herself who has been elected. During her pontificate she presents herself as a charitable pope, helping women and children and appointing Gerold as head of the papal army. However, she becomes pregnant and her reign is then in grave danger. She tries to hold off giving birth until after Easter, but Gerold is killed during the Easter procession by conspirators led by Anastasius, and Joan collapses and then dies in childbirth. Anastasius succeeds her but soon afterwards he is deposed by the Roman people and exiled to a monastery. There he writes the Liber Pontificalis, a list of the popes, from which he omits Joan. Many years later the story of the female pope is made known by Bishop Arnaldo, who is revealed to, in fact, be Arnalda, the daughter of Arn.  The novel places the pontificate of Pope Leo IV between that of Sergius and Joan, but in the film Joan immediately succeeds Sergius. Sergius's brother and deputy Benedict are replaced in the film by Anastasius, increasing the importance of the latter character. In the film, Anastasius poisons Sergius; in the novel, Sergius dies of gout and natural causes and Anastasius poisons Leo. In the novel, Joan spends her first night with Gerold in a house where they seek refuge from a flood, whereas in the film it occurs by a river. The film also removes the couple's attempted abortion of their child, and the childhood relationship between them is only briefly discussed, whereas in the novel that relationship is more detailed; for example, they have a bond via a wolf called Lukas whom they both raise. After Gerold's departure, Richhild kills the wolf and thus symbolically separates the lovers' last bond for years. In the film, it turns out that Joan's mentor at Fulda, Brother Benedict, knows her true identity; in the novel, her identity remains a secret to all the monks there to the end. In the film, the steward Arighis is promoted to papal nomenclator  and does not die, whereas in the book, he dies in a fire during Leo IV's pontificate, sacrificed for Leo's building project, the Leonine Wall. In the novel, Arighis is succeeded by a young man named Waldipert, who works for Anastasius's father Bishop Arsenius and Leo; in the film, Waldipert is Sergius's valet as well as being in the pay of Arsenius and is not murdered as he is in the novel. In the novel, Renatus is the servant of Sergius and not Joan. Similarly, Zelestinus is not mentioned in the film, whereas in the novel, he is a valet at the papal court. Particularly striking is the fact that the novel gives Joan's blond hair as her most dramatic characteristic, but the actress playing Joan in the film has brown hair. Joan dies of a miscarriage in both the film and novel but in the novel her lover Gerold dies in her arms shortly before her death, whereas in the film, they die simultaneously but in two different places. In general, many events in the film are arranged in a different chronology than that of the novel. Some events, such as Joan's marriage, are moved back in time , whilst others are moved forward, such as the proposal to appoint Nicephoros as a bishop, which occurs in Joan's pontificate in the novel but during Sergius' in the film.
