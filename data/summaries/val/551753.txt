The film opens in Thailand, with Antonio Serrano , a mafia drug distributor visiting long-time associate Kinman Tau , a drug kingpin. Serrano is having troubles and wants them to work together, but his request is not reciprocated. Turned off from politics after witnessing the death of his father at Tiananmen Square in China, Los Angeles art student Jake Lo  is lured to a party of Chinese pro-democracy activists. While there, Jake witnesses Serrano killing party sponsor Carl Chang , who was an associate of Tau. A reluctant Jake is placed under protective custody by federal agents and brought to Chicago to testify against Serrano. Some of the agents placed to protect him are corrupt and try to kill Jake, who manages to escape. Another attempt is thwarted by Lieutenant Mace Ryan , a chicago cop who has been after Tau for 10 years. Jake is brought to his base, where he becomes acquainted with his team - Detective Karla Withers  among them, whom he begins to develop feelings for. Jake remains reluctant, but is persuaded by Ryan to join in the efforts to arrest Serrano and obtain information about Tau's next shipment. After a barrage of violence, they are narrowly successful, but Jake becomes angry with Ryan after realising his involvement wasn't necessary. During an unsuccessful raid at the revealed location of the next shipment; Tau's laundry factory, Serrano is murdered by one of Tau's henchmen. Ryan is left bitterly disappointed, but is reunited with Jake, as they, and Withers attempt to bring down the operation once more.
