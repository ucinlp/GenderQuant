 In 1989, Kevin Flynn , software engineer and the CEO of ENCOM International, disappears. Twenty years later, his son, Sam , now ENCOM's primary shareholder, takes little interest in the company beyond playing an annual trick on the board of directors; but is requested by his father's friend, ENCOM executive Alan Bradley , to investigate a message originating from Flynn's shuttered Video arcade. There, Sam discovers a hidden basement in which Sam unintentionally teleports himself to the Grid, a virtual reality created by his father. On the Grid, Sam is sent to compete against a masked program called Rinzler who, having realized that Sam is a human User after seeing him bleed, takes him before CLU, an alter ego of Kevin Flynn who rules the Grid. CLU nearly kills Sam in a Light Cycle match; but the latter is rescued by Quorra , an "apprentice" of Flynn's, who conveys him to his father outside CLU's territory. There, Flynn reveals to Sam that he had been working to create a "perfect" computer system and had appointed CLU and Tron  its co-creators. During this construction, the trio discover a species of naturally-occurring "isomorphic algorithms" , not conceived by Flynn, bearing the potential to resolve various mysteries in science, religion, and medicine. CLU, having deemed them an aberration, betrayed Flynn, captured Tron, and destroyed the ISOs. Meanwhile, the "I/O portal" permitting travel between the two worlds had closed, leaving Flynn captive. Now in control of the system but stalemated, CLU arranged the message sent to Alan, in order to lure Sam onto the Grid, to open the portal for a limited time. Additionally, as Flynn's 'identity disc' is the master key to the Grid and only way to go through the portal, CLU expects Sam to bring Flynn to the portal so that he may take Flynn's disc and go through the portal himself to impose his system on the human world. Against his father's wishes, Sam returns to CLU's territory to find Zuse , a program who can provide safe passage to the I/O portal. At the End of Line Club, its owner Castor reveals himself to be Zuse, then betrays Sam to CLU's guards. In the resulting fight, Flynn rescues his son, Quorra is injured, and Zuse gains possession of Flynn's disc. Zuse attempts to bargain with CLU for the disc, but CLU simply takes the disc and destroys the club. Flynn and Sam stow away aboard a "solar sailer" transport program, where Flynn restores Quorra and reveals her to be the last surviving ISO. Quorra relates to Sam her history with Flynn and expresses her desire to see a sunrise. Shortly thereafter, the transport stops inside a large warship where Flynn, Sam, and Quorra discover that the transport contains inactive programs, scheduled for rectification  to serve CLU and follow him to the real world. Aboard the warship, Quorra is captured and Flynn recognizes Rinzler  as Tron, reprogrammed by CLU, while CLU announces his intention to invade the material world. Sam then reclaims Flynn's disc and rescues Quorra, whereupon CLU, Rinzler and several guards pursue the protagonists in Light Jets. Upon making eye contact with Flynn, Rinzler remembers his past and collides with CLU's Light Jet; but CLU uses Tron's spare baton to escape while Tron falls into the Sea of Simulation, where the colored lights on his armor change from CLU's orange to Tron's original blue. CLU confronts the protagonists at the I/O portal, where Flynn reintegrates with his cybernetic duplicate, destroying them both. Quorra, having traded discs with Flynn, gives Flynn's disc to Sam and they escape to the real world. In Flynn's arcade, Sam backs up the system, and having deactivated it, asks a waiting Alan to take control of ENCOM, naming him chairman of the board. Quorra meets Sam outside, and they depart on his motorcycle. From the rear seat, Quorra witnesses her first sunrise.
