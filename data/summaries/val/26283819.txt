 A small fishing ship after an unsuccessful quest for some draught got not more than a single fish on top of everything the smallest one - a sprat. Despite the miserable catch the captain  reports through the transmitter to the superior of the fishing base Petrov . Of course he mentions a bigger species of fish and doesn't particularize the quantity. After months without any production from the enterprise, the superior of the base in his turn reports personally to the big local boss Kalcho Kalchev . One more time the species are enlarged and even the presence of a considerable shoal is entangled. Sitting to the table the two men have a drink or two of some cognac to celebrate the occasion. They don't stop and decide to specify the catch as a draught of dolphins as more massy kind of sea creature. Being in private later the local boss has a colourful monologue with the portrait on the wall portraying the minister Parushev  of the field they work in. Finally the Kalchev's right hand - the lead engineer  insinuate that the dolphin, as a matter of fact, is actually a kind of an whale.  {{quote box}} So one sunny day in the head department in the capital the message is received - "...We got an whale...". The state employees can't wait to inform the minister. Naturally he spends his days in the nice villa around the city. The pathos spread to all of them. In a fit of euphoria Parushev proposes a new name of their state department - The Ministry of Whales. The ideas of some whales festival are born even a whaling flotilla is mentioned. Leading the procession Parushev, Kalchev and all of the involved are formed up at the pier to welcome the in-bound ship. The festive meeting of the bewildered fishermen is the culmination of the bureaucratic farce.
