The film centers around five strangers who are linked together &mdash; and who meet each other at separate times &mdash; by a series of events that take place on Christmas Eve. The main character is Rose , a woman who is struggling to cope with caring for her mother, an Alzheimer's patient. Meanwhile, Nina  and Mike  are a young couple on the verge of breaking up due to Mike's increasingly jealous behavior. Elsewhere, Artie  is an old waiter who searches for his deceased wife every Christmas Eve. Finally, Jules ([[Marcus Thomas  is a young man who deliberately damages his hand so he can attend a Christmas party in the emergency room, as that was the only happy memory of his childhood. In addition to the five main characters, the mysterious Charlie  is introduced as the person who may be able to help Rose finally realize that she must look after herself more, rather than worrying about everyone else.
