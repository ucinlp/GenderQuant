Heads or Tails is a dark drama: the story of a Native American myth and how it has been twisted throughout the years into something much darker. Every thirteen cycles of the moon, two people stand on a cliff and throw a coin off to compete for a wish. Only those that partake in the ritual see that the wish is only the beginning.Frederick Maryland Online, story synopsis, accessed 01-03-2009
