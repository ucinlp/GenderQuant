This adventure film is a film about smugglers.http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/41861 Filmed in lavish Technicolor, The Man Within is a rousing tale of smugglers, betrayal and redemption. The story is told from the point-of-view of Seaman Andrews , the ward of 19th-century smuggler chieftain, Carlyon . Feeling persecuted by his stern disciplinarian guardian, Seaman Andrews jumps ship and turns Carlyon over to the customs officials. A deadly fight ensues, during which both Andrews and Carlyon escape and head their separate ways. Upon befriending the stepson of a customs agent who was killed by Carlyon, Andrews agrees to testify against his onetime friend and protector in court. To bind the bargain, Lucy , mistress of the Crown's Attorney, makes love to the impressionable, misguided Andrews. Finally realizing that the forces of justice are no more ethical than his fellow smugglers, Andrews refuses to testify against Carlyon, and is himself thrown into prison. Incredible though it may seem, a happy ending results from all this intrigue. In the United States of America, The Man Within was released in a slightly shorter version, retitled The Smugglers.http://www.allmovie.com/work/the-man-within-132440
