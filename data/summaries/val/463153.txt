The film deals with creativity and commercialism. Quint attempts to get back at his boss by making a negative commercial reusing themes from earlier in the film, including Lute saying "The number one product of all human endeavor is waste...waste." The commercial, advertising a Super-8 camera, talks about capturing events while you still can before everything is destroyed and discarded. It ends with Quint operating a car crusher and destroying numerous cameras. The commercial is hailed as a masterpiece, and wins an award, but Quint hurls the award into the Thames.
