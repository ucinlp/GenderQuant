In 1945, news of the Surrender of Japan was received with wide skepticism by most Japanese immigrants in Brazil, who assumed it be mere Allied propaganda. Those who did accept the truth are seen as traitors, "dirty hearts", who dishonor the emperor; patriotic-turned-terrorist organization Shindo Renmei takes in their own hands the duty of killing said traitors. The movie is told from the point of view of the wife of a Shindo Renmei member, who can't help but witness her husband lose himself in fanaticism and bloodshed.
