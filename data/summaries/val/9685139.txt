Dwight and Lucas are at a baseball game when Ruth calls, informing Dwight that he is late with returning their son home. Dwight drives Lucas home in a hurry, thinking he might forfeit his visitation privileges. When he loses control of his vehicle, he accidentally hits a young boy, Josh Learner , who is standing by a roadside. Aware that he has struck the boy, Dwight continues driving on. To Lucas, who has a minor injury from the incident, Dwight lies, saying that they had collided with a tree log. Dwight later hears on a newscast that Josh died in the collision. Subsequently, he tries to cover up the evidence which implicates him in the hit-and-run accident. After the initial shock of losing Josh, Grace  struggles through a process of shock, guilt and grieving process, and is forced to do so without any assistance, because her emotionally absent husband Ethan  is obsessed with finding out who killed their son and frustrated with the lack of progress the police are making in their investigation. Ethan eventually decides to hire a lawyer, who oddly enough turns out to be Dwight. Ethan links Dwight to a flash of memory of the driver and recognises Dwight as the killer of his son. In revenge, and fearing that Dwight would be incarcerated for only a short time, he buys a gun and travels to his house to murder him. Ethan points the gun at Dwight, eager to avoid traumatising Lucas, begs Ethan that they at least go outside. With Dwight in the trunk of his car, Ethan drives him to a remote coastal location. Because of Ethan's emotional state and resulting hesitation, Dwight manages to grab the gun from Ethan and point it at him, but later points it at himself instead. Ethan sees how the knowledge of what he has done is torturing Dwight, and he accepts Dwight's expression of pain as justice. Ethan finds peace and leaves Dwight by the beach. The film ends with Lucas alone watching a taped confession about the incident from Dwight with the authorities, indicating his involvement.
