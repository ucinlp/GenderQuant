A small-town writer takes pause to reassess his wild life of drunken debauchery in director Mitchell Altieri's reflective comedy drama. Conrad Stevens  is about to turn thirty, yet despite his wild nights spent partying with his roommates at the bachelor pad they've taken to calling "The Palace," Connie can't help but feeling that something is missing from his once-charmed life. Feeling stifled in his suburban hometown and trapped in an endless cycle of raucous boozing and non-committal babes, Conrad decides that maybe it's time to make a change from the ordinary and break the everyday cycle.
