Evita traces the life of Eva Duarte  ([[Madonna  from a child from the lower class to becoming the first lady and spiritual leader of Argentina. Eva's death is announced in a movie theater and a public funeral is held in Buenos Aires. Che , an everyman, narrates the story of Eva's rise to power and later illness and death, appearing in many different guises and serving as Eva's conscience and critic. As a young child, Eva attempts to attend her father's funeral in the town of Junín with her mother and siblings. Despite her father's wife and other family denying her family from entering, Eva pays her last respects to her father. Years later, Eva decides to leave Junín to seek a better life in Buenos Aires with a tango singer, Agustín Magaldi , with whom she is having an affair. After Magaldi leaves her, she progresses through several relationships with increasingly influential men, becoming a model, actress and radio personality, until her fateful meeting with Colonel Juan Perón  at a fundraiser. Perón's connection with Eva lends him a populist air, since she is from the working class . Eva has a radio show during Perón's rise and uses all her skills to promote Perón, even when the controlling administration has him jailed in an attempt to stunt his political momentum. The groundswell of support Eva generates forces the government to release Perón, and he finds the people enamored of him and Eva. Perón wins election to the presidency and Eva promises the new government will serve the "descamisados" . At the start of the Perón government, Eva glamors herself up in fur and jewels and enjoys the privileges of being the first lady. Soon after, Eva embarks on the infamous "Rainbow Tour" to Europe. While there she gets mixed receptions from the people; the people of Spain adore her; the people of Italy call her whore and throw things (such as [[Egg  at her, while the Pope gives her a small, meager gift; and the French, while kind to her were also upset that she was forced to leave early as "she seemed to lose interest, she seemed tired"; . Upon returning to Argentina, Eva establishes a foundation and distributes aid while the Perónists otherwise plunder the public treasury. Argentine society is very class-based, and the military officer corps and social elites despise Eva's common roots and affinity for the poor. However, over time, as Eva's illness begins to worsen, she is hospitalized and told she is terminally ill. Eventually, as her illness progresses, she declines the position of Vice President she was offered and makes one final broadcast to the people of Argentina. Towards the end of her life, she understands that her life was short because she shone like the "brightest fire" and helps Perón prepare to go on without her. A large crowd surrounds the Casa Rosada in a candlelight vigil praying for her recovery when the light of her room goes out, signifying her death. Eva's funeral is shown again. Ché is seen at her coffin, laying the blame of her death on Perón. Then he walks up to her glass coffin; kisses it; and walks into the crowd of passing mourners.
