The film is set in the early 20th century in Shanghai International Settlement. The martial arts student Chen Zhen returns to Jingwu School to marry his fiancée Yuan Le-erh. However tragic news awaits him; his master Huo Yuanjia had died, apparently from illness. Chen is deeply saddened and traumatised by the sudden demise of his teacher. Not long after the funeral; two Japanese students from the Bushido School and man working for Hiroshi Susuki in Hongkou, show up. They present a sign to Jingwu School, bearing the words "Sick Men of East Asia" , seemingly as to insult Huo Yuanjia, describing the Chinese as "weaklings" in comparison to the Japanese. They taunt the Jingwu students to fight them and promise that they will "eat their words" if the Jingwu students dare to fight and defeat them. Shortly after, Chen Zhen goes to the Hongkou Dojo alone to return the "gift" . He's met with hostility from the Japanese students and they engage in a fight. Chen Zhen defeats all of them, including their Sensei, single-handedly and effortlessly. He uses his master's style of fighting Mizongyi and a Nunchaku as a weapon during the fight. He smashes the glass on the sign and makes the students who taunted him earlier chew up the paper bearing the derogatory words, so as to make them literally "eat their words". Chen takes a stroll to a park after that. He is refused entry into the park by a Sikh guard who points towards a sign reading "No dogs and Chinese allowed" . After the guard allows a foreigner to bring her pet dog into the park, a Japanese man approaches Chen and tells him that if he behaves like a pet dog, he will be allowed to go in. Chen beats up the man in anger and proceeds to smash the sign with a flying kick. Meanwhile, the Japanese students retaliate by attacking Jingwu School on the orders of their master Hiroshi Suzuki. The Jingwu students are caught by surprise and are totally unprepared for the onslaught. After causing severe damage, the Japanese students leave. They warn Jingwu School to hand over Chen Zhen or else Jingwu will be closed and all the students put under arrest. Chen returns and realises that he has caused big trouble. His fellow students are reluctant to hand him over to the Japanese so they make plans to help him escape from Shanghai. That night, Chen secretly overhears a conversation between the cook and the caretaker and discovers that his master was killed after consuming biscuits laced with poison. He bursts in and confronts them. Chen kills them in blind rage after they claimed responsibility for Huo Yuanjia's death. Chen hangs their bodies from a lamp post after that. The next day, the Jingwu students discover the bodies and suspect that Chen is responsible. However, Chen is nowhere to be found. Eventually, Chen's fiancée finds him hiding near Huo Yuanjia's grave. They share a passionate moment together briefly. At the same time, Suzuki forces the local police inspector to arrest Chen Zhen and bring Chen back to him. The reluctant inspector has no choice but to repeat the Japanese's earlier warnings to Jingwu School. That night, Chen confronts Suzuki's translator and forces a confession out of him, learning the entire truth behind his master's death. But when the cowardly translator sneaks up from behind him, Chen kills the translator and hangs his body from the lamp post. The angry Suzuki decides to take matters into his own hands. He sends his men to attack Jingwu School and kill everyone inside. On the same night, Chen barges into the Dojo to take his revenge. He takes down every single Japanese combatant he meets. Afterwards Chen battles Petrov, a Russian gang boss in league with Suzuki and his plans, who was visiting the Dojo at the time of Chen's attack. Previously Chen, in disguise, had seen Petrov exhibit great feats of strength and fighting ability. The two fighters at first starts out evenly matched and Petrov almost wins, but when Petrov is eventually unable to keep up with the speed of Chen's attacks he gets tired and wounded, Chen then defeats him. Finally, Chen corners Suzuki inside his office. Suzuki uses a Katana to fight back but he is no match for Chen, who is armed with a Nunchaku. In the dramatic ending of the fight scene, Chen sends Suzuki soaring out of the room with a flying kick and kills him, thus avenging his master's death. Chen returns to Jingwu School and finds that many of his fellow students have been killed during the Japanese's raid, although all of the raiders have been killed in the fight as well. After Chen overhears threats on the Jingwu school from a Japanese policeman, he volunteers himself to be arrested so as to protect his master's legacy. Chen speaks to the inspector in private and is assured that Jingwu School will prevail after he leaves. In the final scene, Chen charges and makes a flying kick at a line of armed soldiers just before they open fire at him, suggesting that the soldiers killed him.
