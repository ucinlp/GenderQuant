Eddie Harrington  and Albert Mansfield  are plumbers who receive a call about a leak in the private bathroom of Mr. Van Cleve , a wealthy businessman. The leak is keeping him awake, but the costume ball that his wife  is throwing downstairs is not. Eddie and Albert enlist the aid of a friend, Elsie Hammerdingle , a taxi driver, to take them to the mansion. While they are upstairs attempting to fix the leak, but flooding the room instead, Peter Evans , a guest dressed as a cab driver, mistakes Elsie for another costumed guest...despite her insistence that she really is just a cab driver. He winds up inviting her to another gala event, Mrs. Winthrop's  estate Briarwood, where a valuable painting The Plunger is to be revealed. Meanwhile, Eddie and Albert mistakenly receive their own invitation to the event, as Mrs. Van Cleave was intending to send them a letter of complaint for the devastation that they inflicted on her home, but instead mails them her invitation to Briarwood. They think it is a reward for a job well done, and look at it as a chance to meet other wealthy clients. However, a loan shark named Drexel  that they owe money to demands they steal the painting while they are there. When they refuse to go through with the plan, Drexel and Marlow , a crooked chauffeur at the party, attempt to steal the painting themselves. When the painting is discovered as missing, Gloria Winthrop , accuses Elsie, Eddie, and Albert as the thieves. However, they clear their names when Eddie and Albert, in a firetruck, capture Drexel and Marlow and recover the painting.
