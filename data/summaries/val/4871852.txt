15-year-old Tracey Berkowitz  is naked under a tattered shower curtain at the back of a bus, looking for her little brother Sonny , who thinks he's a dog. Tracey's journey leads into the dark underbelly of the city, into the emotional cesspool of her home, through the brutality of her high school, the clinical cat-and-mouse games with her shrink and her soaring fantasies of Billy Zero  - her rock and roll saviour. Her travels also put her in contact with the seedier inhabitants of the city, like Lance , her would-be saviour who ultimately puts her life in jeopardy. Tracey's stories begin to intertwine truth with lies, and hope with despair, as she moves closer to the truth of Sonny's disappearance.
