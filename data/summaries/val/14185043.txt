Pete St. John , a ruthless and highly successful media consultant, is juggling a couple of other political candidates when asked to join the campaign of wealthy but little-known Ohio businessman Jerome Cade , who hopes to win the Senate seat being vacated by St. John's friend Sam Hastings . He comes into conflict with Arnold Billing , a public relations expert whose firm Cade has hired. St. John's investigation into Cade's background prompts Billing to retaliate by bugging St. John's office phones, flooding the basement of his headquarters, tampering with his private jet, and interfering with his other clients. These actions force St. John to take a hard look at himself and what he has become and to decide whether his ex-wife Ellen Freeman  and his former partner Wilfred Buckley  are right in believing that his success is due primarily to the exploitation of others.
