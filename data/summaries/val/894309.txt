 In the faraway Arctic Circle, an atomic bomb test is done, codenamed "Operation Bravo". But then, Professor Tom Nesbitt afraid what will happen later, and his fear comes true. The nuclear explosion awakened a 35-feet tall giant diapsid known as the "Rhedosaurus" who later escapes to the sea. Then, he attacks a ship, then surfacing ashore in Maine and destroyed a high lighthouse at night. Then, he surfaces in Manhattan, and wrecks buildings. The monster also breathes fire from his maw. The monster returns to the sea and resurfaces in River Thames, then wreaks havoc again. Missiles had no effect, and Carl Nesbitt, Professor Nesbitt's brother, was killed. Then, the beast escaped to the sea. Then, in New York, the monster attacked again. The monster are annoyed by military and destroyed them all, then swims away. The military detected him moving to Coney Island, so the S.W.A.T uses submarine. The Radar Man detects the monster and they attack. Dr. Thurgood Elson suggests that the monster should be killed by anti-radiation, so Corporal Jason Stone, the sharpshooter member of the army was hired by Colonel Jack Evans and Captain Phil Jackson. They set an isotope missile who will neutralize the beast's nuclear power. Fighter jets are sent and sped up to Coney Island, and they battled. Some were shot down by the beast's nuclear fire breath but Corporal Stone already get his isotope injector bullet, and he sets up. He aims the Beast's neck, and shoots the isotope bullet to the Beast, neutralizing the radiation in the monster's body! The Beast roared a terrible cry of pain and fell to the ground, as the amusement park of Coney Island burned from the result of the battle.
