Max Keeble  is a seventh grade junior-high school paperboy who has a huge crush on Jenna , the daughter of one of his paper recipients. Max has two best friends, Robe and Megan , and is constantly bullied by Troy McGinty and Dobbs ([[Noel Fisher  by physical humiliation and stealing lunch money. Max is enemies with the corrupt school principal, Elliot T. Jindrake ([[Larry Miller  and the Evil Ice Cream Man , and also learns that an animal shelter that he visits is being closed down. When Max unexpectedly finds out that he is moving to Chicago after his father, Donald "Don" Keeble  gets a promotion, Max is initially upset at having to move, but later plots to exact revenge against Jindrake, Troy, Dobbs, and the Evil Ice Cream Man, believing that when they try to retaliate, Max will be gone. Max, Robe, and Megan concoct methods of revenge including terrifing Troy by playing a main theme song of the fictional children's television show, MacGoogle the Highlander Frog, and later severely traumatizing him by trapping him in the gym with MacGoogle, instigating a fight between Dobbs and the Evil Ice Cream Man by stealing a coolant coil for his ice cream truck and his handheld device, and lastly to ruin Jindrake's chances of becoming superintendent to replace the current superintendent, Crazy Legs , by planting animal pheronomes within his breath spray, instigating a food fight, and later by sabotaging his announcements by placing a cardboard cutout of Max pointing at Jindrake claiming that he was wearing a thong. Once his missions are completed, Max ends up ditching Robe and Megan's going away party by accepting an invite to Jenna's milkshake party, causing a falling out. In addition, Don, taking Max's advice to heart earlier, announces that he quit his job and starting his own business, meaning that Max is not moving after all. Max freaks out at this news, and learns that Robe, Megan, and the entire school are suffering because of his actions. Max states that, no matter who you are, you can always stand up for yourself. Max confronts Jindrake, Troy, and Dobbs one final time, and with his help of Robe, Megan, and the entire school, eventually defeats Troy and Dobbs for good by throwing them into the dumpster, stops Jindrake from demolishing the animal shelter, and later gets Jindrake fired for fiddling with his school budget. The film ends when Max riding on his bicycle delivering newspapers around his neighborhood, and the Evil Ice Cream Man starts pursuing Max once again.
