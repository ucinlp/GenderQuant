During the demonstration of a device which allows the observation of alternate dimensions, an accident causes the building in which the demonstration is taking place - and its occupants - to be transported to a dimension seemingly devoid of animal life but for large, vicious carnivores which hunt and kill the displaced humans one by one. A creature with six eyes attacks the people. The senator is ripped in half, and Lex has a heart attack. While researching an alien creature, Josh Burke sprays Al with a toxin, and the first creature kills the private. While out getting water, two groups of three include Sam, Josh, and Dr. Karen Frost in one group, and Rivers, Dr. Jillian O'Hara and Murphy in the other, try to get out. Josh steals an egg, drops it on the rock, and is instantly ripped up by "Momma." Rivers blows him self up to save Sam, and Brian Murphy is attacked and killed by "Momma". Only Colonel Synn, Dr. Frost, and Dr. O'Hara are left. Colonel Synn and Dr. O'Hara manage to repair the device and return home, but sadly, Dr. Frost, who went off by herself in an attempt to find intelligent life because of a structure she saw in the distance, is left behind and is killed  by a monster.
