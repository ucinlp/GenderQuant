Unable and unwilling to live apart from his girlfriend, Andy  has decided to move from the UK to the United States, so that he can be near Rebecca  while she studies medicine at university. He meets Cassian Marsh , who persuades him to approach the Omega fraternity where Marsh is the leader. Following a typical fraternity initiation, Andy is offered a place in the Omega house and readily accepts. He then notices a suspicious looking old man  hanging around the campus and the stranger warns him that the brotherhood are hiding a dark secret: Marsh is part of a Voodoo Cult and that remaining at the fraternity could be dangerous. Andy decides he is just a crazy old man; but, as events unfold, it seems that Marsh is just using the Frat house as a front in order to practice voodoo along with his zombie friends.Voodoo, 1995, VHS, Planet Productions.Voodoo [1995], Buried Sci-Fi Database, 16 October, 2008.
