Mary Smith , daughter of presidential hopeful Horace Smith , has lived a cloistered life free of any scandal. Although she is devoted to her father and supports his political aspirations, she longs for a life of her own. Believing she needs some excitement in her life, Mary's free-spirited Uncle Hannibal ([[Harry Davenport  takes her dancing at a nightclub, which the police raid for gambling. When Horace learns that press reporters have discovered Mary's name on the police report, he sends his daughter off to the family's Palm Beach, Florida mansion. For Mary, Palm Beach during the off season is a place of loneliness and boredom. She asks her two housemaids  if she can go along with them on a blind date with some cowboys from a visiting rodeo. The two maids reluctantly agree. Feeling sorry for the inexperienced Mary, they coach her on their three-step "system" for getting a man interested: flatter him, get him talking about himself, and play on his sympathy with a hard-luck story. The three women go to the rodeo, and afterwards meet up with their dates at the Rodeo Cafeteria and pair off. Mary is immediately attracted to the tall, lanky, and unpretentious cowboy Stretch Willoughby  and arranges to be with him. After dinner, they continue their evening back at Mary's beachfront estate. Aware that the plain-spoken Stretch is suspicious of high society rich folk, Mary pretends to be a lady's maid whose "boss" is out of town. Mary attempts to get the shy cowboy interested by following the first two steps of the "system" but fails to attract his interest. Determined, she proceeds to the third step, inventing a hard-luck story about her drunken father and four younger sisters whom she alone must support. When she adds a tear or two to embellish her story, Stretch is won over, and the evening ends with the two kissing in the moonlight. The next morning, an enamoured Stretch Willoughby appears at the mansion prepared to ask for Mary's hand in marriage. Unprepared for this turn of events, Mary casually dismisses his awkward proposal. Angered at the rejection, Stretch tosses Mary into the swimming pool and storms off. Completely fascinated by this man unlike any she had ever hoped to meet, Mary follows Stretch when he boards a ship for Galveston. Determined to apologize, Mary finally succeeds in getting the stubborn cowboy to listen to her. But her explanation for her behavior falls short of actually confessing her true identity. The days on board the ship bring the two closer together, and on the last night before docking at Galveston, they are married by the ship's captain . When the newly married couple arrives at Galveston, they set up temporary home in a tent at a rodeo camp. Mary does her best to adapt to the dusty and primitive conditions, but she is having a difficult time. Stretch senses Mary's unease, but believes it stems from her worrying over her "family"â€”the fictitious drunken father and four younger sisters she's supporting. He suggests she return to Palm Beach alone to settle her family obligations. Although she is ashamed of her continued deception, Mary fears Stretch will reject her if he learns the truth about her and her wealthy family. Stretch believes he's married a "work horse" who works hard to support her family, not a "show horse" like her fictitious boss. Confused and miserable, Mary agrees to go back home for a few days and later meet up with Stretch at his ranch in Montana. When Mary arrives back at her Palm Beach mansion, she learns that her father is on his way with all his committee members, plus an important congressman who holds the presidential nomination in his power. Her sympathetic Uncle Hannibal arrives early, and Mary tearfully confides her secret marriage to him. Soonafter, Mary's father arrives, full of plans for the following weeks. He assumes his daughter will serve as dutiful hostess and support his plans. Feeling trapped again, Mary finally confesses to her father that she is married to a cowboy and plans to join her new husband in Montana immediately. Mary's courage, however, is short-lived. When she sees how her news has crushed her father, she agrees to stay and perform her duties until her father secures the presidential nomination. At his Montana ranch, Stretch is busy making preparations for Mary's arrival, helping to build a new house for his bride. But Mary never arrives. Stretch decides to head back to Palm Beach and find out what's wrong with his missing wife. When Stretch arrives at the Palm Beach mansion, he insists on talking to Mary's "employers". He bursts into the dining room, only to see his wife at the head of a dinner party table, surrounded by her father and all his distinguished guests, who proceed to have a few laughs at the cowboy's expense. When asked for his opinion about Mary's father running for president, Stretch delivers his scathing opinion about the whole group before leaving in anger. Seeing his daughter's distress finally gives Horace Smith pause to think about what his behavior has been as a father. He is there to comfort Mary as they listen to the whistle of the train that is taking her husband out of her life. Back in Montana, a subdued Stretch arrives home only to find his father-in-law Horace Smith sitting on his front porch in the sun, wanting to chat about farming. Horace also tells Stretch that he has quit the presidential race because he now knows that Mary's happiness is more important. He goes on to say that all her life Mary has made sacrifices, thinking only of her father, never herself. Upon entering the ranchhouse, the bewildered Stretch finds a party underway, Uncle Hannibal raiding the kitchen, and Mary herself baking a cake with Ma Hawkins. The story ends with the cowboy and the lady kissing in the kitchen of their new Montana home.{{cite web|last|titlehttp://themave.com/Cooper/filmog/cowblady2.htm Coop: A Tribute|accessdate"classic">{{cite web}}
