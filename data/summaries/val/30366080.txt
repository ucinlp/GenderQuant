One summer a long time ago, a little girl and boy, Jessica and Michael, were brought together by a very special dog. They played all summer long; it was puppy love. When the summer ended, they never saw each other again. Years later the girl's parents retire and decide to sell their house. Jessica, now grown and recently widowed, decides she needs to start over and move back home with her son. She hopes to buy the old house as a Christmas surprise. However, her plan goes awry when she discovers that her parents have already sold it. She schemes to get the house back for herself. In the end, she realizes she should be nicer to Michael and she buys his previous house for him in order to make up for 'sabotaging' his house sale. The movie ends with the two remembering each other from their childhood and they kiss while the golden retriever has puppies. Toward the end the golden retriever runs away happily. It is left for the viewer to decide whether the two moved in together or not.
