A vicious stranger, the "Man from Bodie" , terrorizes the small settlement of Hard Times. He kills the only man who stands up to him, Mr. Fee, and rapes his girl Flo. Before he leaves, he burns down the handful of buildings. Only a few people stay, among them Will Blue . Blue takes in Fee's young orphaned son Jimmy ([[Michael Shea  and convinces his woman Molly  to stay there with them. A few other people arrive to town. Zar  and his four saloon girls settle in to serve the nearby miners. Isaac Maple ([[John Anderson  comes looking for his long-gone storekeeper brother, so Blue persuades him to reopen the general store. A drifter, Leo Jenks , also lazes around town. Blue tries hard to build a family and a town, but Molly despises him for not standing up against the Man from Bodie and is obsessed with revenge against him for what he did. They both expect the Man will return in the spring. Molly works on Jenks, a fine shot, and even infects Jimmy with her consuming hatred, getting him a shotgun. Finally, the villain shows up and resumes his terrorizing ways. Molly persuades Jenks to go after him. Jenks ends up killing Zar by mistake and is gunned down. Blue is wounded in the shoulder, but then the Man runs out of bullets and Blue shoots him several times. Blue carries the body home to show Molly. When she gingerly approaches, the dying Man revives and grabs her hand. Her panicked yell for help brings Jimmy running with his shotgun. Blue tries to grab the weapon, but it goes off, hitting the Man in the face killing him, but also hitting Molly in the stomach. Just before she dies, she asks Blue to hold her. Later, from her gravesite, Blue and Jimmy see a growing town.
