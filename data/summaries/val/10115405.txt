{{original research}} Strawberry Shortcake in Big Apple City chronicles Strawberry Shortcake's trip to Big Apple City , so she can compete in a baking contest at "the little theater off Times Pear" . Strawberry's journey, however, is in jeopardy due to the constant interference of the Peculiar Purple Pieman of Porcupine Peak, who is her only competition in the bake-off. The Pieman counts on his kohlrabi cookies and a little trickery to beat Strawberry and her famous shortcake. A "Spinach Village" is also mentioned, a reference to Greenwich Village.
