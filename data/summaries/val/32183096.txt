 The film opens with a short segment explaining the events which transpired to culminate in Conan's launch of the Legally Prohibited Tour. It focuses on the rift with NBC and the outpouring of support shown by his fans while the fiasco played out. The documentary continues with Conan explaining that the idea for the tour came to them while thinking of things they could do in the 6 months they were legally prohibited from appearing on television. The following segments show glimpses of the thought process for the tour, and then an extremely nervous Conan and team members as they wait in realtime to see the results of whether or not their show would sell. All the venues begin to sell out at a fast pace and the stage is set for them to proceed with the planning of the tour. The rest of the documentary details the creative process behind various jokes/musical acts by Conan's team. In between segments of the live show a lot of fan interactions, attendance of functions, hosting at Bonnaroo and encounters with celebrities  are shown - not all of them are pleasant for an exceedingly exhausted and tired Conan as the tour progresses. Conan held a secret show for his fans at the studio of Jack White, with White participating in the show itself. During the film there is little interviewing between Conan and the director himself, though the few questions that are captured are answered in great detail. A constant during the entire documentary is Conan O'Brien's personal assistant with whom he shares humorous  banter till the close of the film. The documentary ends with a title card displaying the end date of the tour and that Conan had a few weeks off before starting his next assignment as the host of his cable talk show at TBS, a shot of Conan walking out onto the studio stage after the Conan theme has been played by the band is shown after the title card. A recorded performance at Jack White's studio is played while the credits roll.
