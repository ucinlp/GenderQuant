Henry Shand goes to Alaska to search for gold and find his fortune. While there, his spoiled son Reggie gets mad that he has to work for money. What further angers him is the fact that he has to share the dogsled with his two-year-old brother, nicknamed "Bobo". Reggie decides to take matters into his own hands and pushes Bobo off the sled, leaving him to die in the wintery Klondike wilderness. Some twenty years later, Henry has died, giving Reggie a large inheritance of thirty million dollars. Reggie foolishly spends it within a year, causing his new wife, Rhonda, to become an angry alcoholic, as they have gone broke and had to move back in with Reggie's mother, Margaret. Margaret has gone insane since Bobo's disappearance and Henry's death, and has now spent much of the family's fortune on buying homes for stray cats. Meanwhile, a biologist named Penny arrives from Alaska, claiming to have found Bobo. They discover that Bobo has been raised by wolves, causing him to sniff everyone's butts, run on all fours, growl and bark, and run through wet cement while chasing firetrucks or dogs. Reggie decides to manipulate Bobo into signing over his inheritance to him to pay off gambling debts. Reggie tells Penny that she can use Bobo for wolf research, but first must teach him to walk, talk, read, and, of course, write. Penny shaves Bobo and gives him a haircut, but getting him to act like a man proves to be a difficult task, and Bobo continues to unknowingly cause problems. Things get even worse when Bobo goes out in public, wreaking havoc in a shopping mall by going into dressing rooms, unwittingly trying on clothes and walking out of stores with them. As Bobo behaves more like a man, Penny begins to fall for him. Reggie wants her to speed up the teaching, as the people he owes money want their cash quickly. In court, Penny stands up for Bobo, having discovered Reggie's scheme. Bobo refuses to sign, and Reggie frantically attempts to demonstrate how Bobo was acting, making him look ridiculous to the judge, who drops the case. Bobo and Penny go outside and kiss, but Bobo stops to chase a firetruck.
