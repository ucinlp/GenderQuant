The film begins with Alice  apparently waking up at the mansion, as in the beginning of the first Resident Evil. Alice defeats obstacles she had encountered or watched being encountered in the first film, though she is eventually killed by a bouncing mine. Her body is dumped into a pit that is full of Alice clones. The camera zooms out from the underground facility's camouflaged entrance. Despite all the Umbrella activities and attempts to quarantine and sanitize Raccoon City, the virus managed to leave the quarantine, and it has spread around the world. As organisms were infected, the environment became destroyed. Umbrella has placed facilities underground to prevent the human survivors from finding out about Umbrella's experiments. Five years after the spread, the rest of the world eventually turned into deserted wastelands. Meanwhile, the original Alice wanders the deserts of the Southwestern U.S. She has separated from the rest of her group for their own protection, as Umbrella is tracking her and she is afraid that they will kill anyone linked to her. She searches for supplies and travels on a motorcycle. Alice hears a call for help during this and goes to investigate, only to discover it is some survivors playing a cruel joke. They catch her and a man starts trying to sexually assault her. She warns him not to touch her, but he just slaps her, so she kicks him, killing him. Another man knocks her out. She wakes in a pit, and the sadistic survivors force her to face zombie dogs but she defeats them, also collapsing the ground, allowing the dogs to get up to the survivors and kill them. Alice escapes, unhurt. In the Umbrella facility, Dr. Sam Isaacs  considers Alice's re-capture a top priority since she has the ability to bond with the T-virus. He tries to persuade the Umbrella board that he can use her blood to develop a permanent cure, as well as tame the infected. The new Umbrella chairman Albert Wesker  refuses the re-capture, and orders Isaacs to use the clones to create a cure, with no authorization to recapture Alice until they are aware of her location and ability to capture her. Meanwhile, Claire Redfield's  convoy, which includes the Raccoon City survivors Carlos Olivera  and Lloyd "L.J." Jefferson Wade , along with new survivors K-Mart , Mikey ([[Chris Egan , Chase  and Nurse Betty ([[Ashanti  along with others, travels cross-country, looking for medical supplies, food, water, gas, and permanent shelter. One day, in a deserted town, while searching for supplies, L.J. is bitten, but keeps it a secret. The next morning, the convoy is attacked by infected crows, whom Claire deduces were feeding on the infected flesh. The crows almost overpower the convoy, killing Nurse Betty and taking out the flamethrower operator, causing the weapon to careen out of control. Alice appears and saves Carlos and others. She uses her psionic powers to cover the sky with a blanket of fire from the flamethrower, killing the remaining crows. But after that she passes out, having pushed her powers to the limit. Carlos catches her, holding her close, hinting that they may become close. She comes round later, safe with the covoy and being watched over by K-Mart. She is introduced to Claire, giving her a diary she found. The book claims there is a "safe zone" in Alaska. Alice and Carlos convince Claire to take her convoy to Alaska. They agree to go to Las Vegas to search for supplies for their trip to Alaska. Meanwhile, in the facility, Dr. Isaacs' attempts to domesticate the infected have led to a new zombie breed. Wesker's security officer, Captain Slater , is adamant about Isaacs not disregarding Umbrella's regulations. Slater does admit that the "super zombies"  would be useful, but reiterates that Isaacs is out of control with his new horde, and he is losing his mind trying to re-capture Alice. Umbrella triangulates Alice's location based on her psionic abilities. Dr. Isaacs has a crate of his new zombies sent to ambush the convoy, against Wesker's orders. Most of the convoy, including Chase and Mikey, are killed in the ambush and Carlos is infected by L.J. as he turns. Umbrella tries to shut Alice down remotely, but she breaks free from their programming and continues to fight. She finds and kills the Umbrella team at the scene and Isaacs becomes infected as he flees. Alice and K-Mart use Isaacs' computer to track the helicopter's flight path, leading to Umbrella's underground location. The convoy arrives at the site, which is surrounded by infected. Carlos begins to slowly succumb to the virus, and he sacrifices himself by plowing his truck into the infected mob and blowing them up, giving Alice and Claire time to load survivors into the helicopter. Alice decides to stay behind. She finds the pit full of her clones, and determined, enters the facility. Ordered by Wesker to liquidate Isaacs, Slater finds him locked in his lab, injecting himself with massive doses of anti-virus in an attempt to counteract the infection, which causes him to mutate from overdosing. Slater shoots Dr. Isaacs, triggering his mutation into a powerful Tyrant, and he devours Slater instantly. Issacs kills all the facility employees, but the facility's AI, the White Queen  manages to temporarily lock him in the facility's lower levels. Entering the facility, Alice meets the White Queen, who informs Alice that her blood is the cure to the T-virus and puts the facility at her disposal to develop a cure. She then tells Alice about Isaacs. Alice agrees to deal with him. On her way to the lab's lower levels, Alice discovers one of her clones, still in development. The clone awakens, but seems to die from premature exposure. During a battle between Isaacs and Alice, they find themselves in a replica of the Hive's laser corridor. The grid activates and slices Isaacs apart. Just as Alice is about to meet the same fate, the system is deactivated by her clone, who has inexplicably revived. Meanwhile, Claire has left with survivors in the helicopter for Alaska. Later, in Tokyo, Japan, Wesker informs the rest of the Umbrella board that the North American facility has been destroyed and now rendered unstable, and he will now control everything from Japan. Alice's hologram makes an appearance, declaring that she is coming for him and Umbrella. Standing beside her clone, Alice looks out onto the hundreds of pods containing her developing clones, as the scene blacks out.
