The film, set in California, opens with Cosmo Vitelli  making the final payment on a longstanding gambling debt to a sleazy loanshark . To celebrate his long-anticipated freedom, strip club owner Vitelli has an expensive night out with his three favorite dancers . The evening culminates in a poker game in which Vitelli loses $23,000, returning him to the debtor's position he had just left. Using the debt as leverage, his mob creditors coerce him into agreeing to perform a "hit" on a rival. Vitelli is led to believe that his target is a smalltime criminal of minor consequence, the Chinese bookie of the film's title; but in fact, he is the capo of the Chinese mafia, "the heaviest cat on the West Coast." Vitelli manages to kill the man and several of his bodyguards, but is severely wounded before escaping. In addition to the potentially fatal gunshot wound he sustains, Vitelli comes to realize that his assignment was a set-up: that his mob employers double-crossed him and had no expectation he would survive his debut as a hitman. Forced into a corner again, Vitelli manages to kill or elude his assailants, but the film ends with no indication of whether Vitelli will survive his ordeal, as the show at his club goes on.
