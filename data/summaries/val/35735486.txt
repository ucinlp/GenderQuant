For forty years the Havo voor Muziek en Dans has given talented young people the opportunity to study music and dance in depth as well as following the normal high school curriculum, with the possibility of going on to the conservatory or dance academy. Each pupil dreams of becoming a professional dancer or musician. The film focuses on eight students: John, Lorenzo, Genelva, Paul, Misha, Alysh, Mickel and Rory.{{cite web}} The camera gives a view of the pupils' daily life in the school as the camera "dances" between classrooms and practice rooms. It shows the tension of the tough entrance exams and the demanding teachers. It shows the sacrifices the pupils have to make to realize their dreams, such as 12-year old Alysh from distant Joure who has to live in lodgings while she studies at the school.
