The film follows several characters both black, white as well as mixed. Maxwell Fleury  is a white plantation owner's son who suffers from an inferiority complex and makes rash decisions to prove his worth. He lives with his beautiful wife, Sylvia . Maxwell is tormented by extreme jealousy of his wife, and is envious of his younger sister Jocelyn . Jocelyn is being courted by Evan Templeton , a war hero visiting the Governor of the island, his father Lord Templeton . The film also follows David Boyeur , a young black man emerging as a powerful politician representing the common people and seen as a threat to the white ruling class. Mavis Norman , a woman from the elite white class strikes up a romantic interest in Boyeur and much of the film explores the tension between these two. Finally, the film takes a look at the interracial romance between Margot Seaton , a black drug store clerk, and Denis Archer , aide to the Governor. Other characters include Hilary Carson  who Maxwell Fleury thinks is having an affair with his wife; Colonel Whittingham , the head of police, who investigates the murder of Hilary Carson central to the plot; a journalist named Bradshaw ; and finally Julian Fleury  and his wife  who are both hiding secrets from their children. The characters and their relationships with each other are all shown to be complex and the issues being addressed were rather taboo for 1957. Furthermore, the film can be enjoyed for the lush, beautiful scenery and unpredictable plot dynamics. Belafonte breaks his character to sing a calypso title song.
