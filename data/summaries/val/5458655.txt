Dom Giotti, founder of the Staten Island Catapult Development Committee  maintains that the commuting needs of Staten Islanders have long been underserved by a cost-prohibitive dichotomy of bridge or boat. In his opinion the outermost New York borough is a trove of history and culture that remains largely untapped due to a lack of mass transit alternatives. To that end, Dom proposes a “seminal transit alternative” for the Staten Island community. Under the rallying cry “Where mass transit has failed…physics shall prevail!”, Dom spearheads an initiative to build a large-scale catapult that launches commuters back and forth from Staten Island to downtown Manhattan in 5 minutes. Although his vision is initially met with bemusement and doubt, Dom soldiers on and eventually develops a prototype.
