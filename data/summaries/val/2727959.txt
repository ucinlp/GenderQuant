Lifelong best friends Alice Marano  and Darlene Davis  graduate from high school and make plans to have one last "knock-out trip together" before they are separated by Darlene going to college. Darlene is perceived to be the "nice" girl, and Alice the "bad" one. The idea of vacationing in Hawaii seems less appealing to the girls than the sudden notion of going to Thailand. It is revealed in dialogue that Darlene's father has not been approached about the idea of going to Thailand, but that Alice's father has given her permission because he believes Darlene is going. Alice suggests to Darlene that she simply not tell her father she is going to Thailand instead of Hawaii. The two girls fly to Thailand and while there, meet a captivating Australian man, who calls himself Nick Parks . He befriends the girls and uses romantic charm to gain their trust. He claims he works for a software company that allows him to loll about in the sun awaiting his next assignment. Darlene is particularly smitten with Nick and convinces Alice to take Nick up on his offer to treat the two of them to what amounts to a day trip to Hong Kong. They check out of their hotel and have their bags carried down to an awaiting cab. Hopping in the back seat while the bellhop loads the bags in the trunk, the girls are running late to the airport. While they are waiting in line to board, the Thai police rush the surprised girls with guns drawn â€” discovering that the backpack that Darlene has packed but Alice is carrying has a few kilos of heroin inside. As they are interrogated separately, Alice's street smarts prevent her from signing a confession written in Thai. Darlene answers questions posed by a Thai official, the official then speaks to a typist in Thai who appears to transcribe the conversation. But Darlene is tricked into signing a confession to the crimes she is accused of but remains unaware of it until Alice points out that neither of them would be foolish enough to sign a confession written in Thai, which neither can understand. Abruptly the girls are placed in prison after pleading their case in vain, but instead of receiving the expected life sentence they "get off easy" with 33 years. There are a few other Westerners in the jail, one from Jamaica who refers to the prison as a "broke-down palace" and tells the girls they should seek the help of "Yankee Hank", an American lawyer. The British girl hears this and scoffs at Hank's lawyering skill. Meanwhile in the U.S., Darlene's father learns of his daughter's and her friend's arrest. He eventually flies to Thailand to plead with the U.S. officials to get his daughter out. He visits his daughter Darlene in prison and warmly reassures her that everything will be fine as she apologizes profusely for getting into trouble. Darlene excitedly reports to Alice that her father is going to get them out and that he wants to speak with her. Alice enthusiastically greets Darlene's father, but he lashes out, venting his rage at her for masterminding whatever scheme she created to get his daughter in trouble. Eventually "Yankee Hank", Henry Greene , an American attorney living in Thailand, arrives to see if he might get paid for acting on behalf of the girls. Darlene's father sends the money to Hank to appeal the girls' case. At first, Greene is confident about appealing their case when his Thai wife, also a lawyer, points out that the charges against the girls involve six kilos of heroin, when that amount would never have fit into the back pack. The girls are delighted with Hank's clever play, until the Thai prosecution bring forward a witness who testifies he served them drinks poolside at a swank hotel where Alice tried billing a random room number, instead of paying cash, as Darlene suggested . This causes them to lose their appeal. Green walks away from the girls' case until his wife discovers a clue in the police file that might lead to the whereabouts of the elusive Nick Parks. Trying a different tactic, he meets with DEA agent Roy Knox , who has influence with the police. Though Knox admits that the girls were probably duped, he firmly believes that someone has to go to jail for this crime. As long as no Nick Parks  can be produced to clear the girls, he says they will finish out the remainder of their sentences. Greene follows up the lead, travelling to Hong Kong to get information from another girl used by the smuggler whose alias is Nick Parks. He confronts DEA agent Knox with the uncovered evidence about Parks, but is shot down when Knox tells him Parks has friends in high places. Greene threatens the corrupt prosecutor with exposure to the American media and he agrees to a deal. If the girls confess to the crime and withdraw their naming of Nick Parks, they will receive a royal pardon. The girls agree and sign a confession wherein they claim Nick Parks is a figment of their imagination. However, they have been duped by the prosecutor, who uses their confession to assure they will receive no pardon. Alice, deciding to take responsibility for her life and realizing that Darlene will be unable to bear prison, falls to her knees and begs the King of Thailand to allow her to serve both Darlene's sentence and her own  in exchange for Darlene's release, as Darlene should not have to pay for her mistake. The offer is accepted, and the film ends with the girls' friendship, riven with conflicts, is restored. Darlene bids Alice farewell and returns to the States, promising that she will not stop trying to get Alice released from prison. Alice's voice-over indicates her acceptance of fate and the belief that Darlene and Greene will never stop attempting to get her released.
