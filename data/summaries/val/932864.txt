Odile  meets a man named Franz  in an English language class. She has told him of a large pile of money stashed in the villa where she lives with her aunt, Mme. Victoria and a man named M. Stoltz in Joinville, a Parisian suburb. Franz tells his friend Arthur  of the money – and his nascent romance with Odile – and the two hatch a plan to steal it. Meanwhile, Franz and Arthur try to seduce Odile. Ultimately, Arthur wins Odile, and they spend the night together. Arthur's uncle learns of their plot and wants a cut of the money. Franz, Arthur, and Odile now must commit the robbery the night before they had planned, the night they knew M. Stoltz would be away from home. Moreover, Mr. Stoltz grows suspicious, and he hides the money and changes the locks. When they arrive, Franz and Arthur tie up Mme. Victoria and lock her in an armoire. They only find a small amount of cash in the house, and when they open the armoire, to interrogate Mme. Victoria about the rest of the money, they find that she is dead. Franz, Arthur, and Odile flee the scene at once, until suddenly, Arthur declares he will return to the home, to verify that Mme. Victoria is in fact dead. This is a ploy: Arthur knows where the rest of the money is hidden, and he plans take it for himself. But on the highway, Franz notices Arthur's uncle heading in the direction of the villa; he and Odile turn around to follow. There, they witness Arthur's being shot by his uncle and with his final breath, Arthur shoots his uncle in return. Moments later, M. Stoltz arrives, gathers his money strewn on the ground. Mme. Victoria – believed dead – suddenly rushes out of the house. Odile and Franz drive off with a small stack of money from the robbery. Odile, crestfallen, declares, "I'm disgusted with life." The two decide to flee to South America, and the narrator declares his story has ended here, "like in a pulp novel," and promises a technicolor sequel chronicling Odile and Franz's tropical adventures.
