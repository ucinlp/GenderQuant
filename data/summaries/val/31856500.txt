In Sicily, Count Martinello is assassinated by Cardi and his mafia group on what would have been his wedding day. His bride to be, Countess Margherita, gets word of this from American Norvin Blake, who fails to protect her from Cardi, who wants her for his own. Later, Margherita and Norvin meet in New Orleans, where he declares his love for her. Recognizing Gian Norcone as the group leader that killed the count, Norvin has him arrested after getting into a fight with him. Caesar Maruffi, a supposed friend and admirer who suits Margherita, is discovered to be Cardi. In the middle of a fight between Cardi and Norvin, Cardi is stabbed by Lucrezia, Margherita's maid. In the end, Norvin finally wins Margherita.Film Fun, May 1922, Vol. 35, No. 397, p.51The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures Produced in the United States: Feature Films, 1961-1970.
