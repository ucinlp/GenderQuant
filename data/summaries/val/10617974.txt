Natwar is a young boy when his beloved older brother and caretaker, police officer Gridharilal , is framed for bribery by sinister criminal mastermind Vikram . When he grows up, Natwar  creates a secret identity for himself, posing as a powerful and mysterious underworld figure named Mr. Natwarlal, determined to slowly but surely exact vengeance on Vikram. This was another 'Hit' of Amitabh Bachchan.
