Vinod's wife Sudha sees a vagabond named Raja and tries to instill some good ways in him. Vinod is sceptical about this, but Raja comes to regard Sudha as maternal figure. Finally, Vinod decides to help Raja by sending latter to complete his education and become a journalist. Meanwhile, Vinod finds that S.K. Vardhan, a respected man in the society, is behind many malpractices. Vinod starts exposing S.K's illicit business. In retaliation, S.K. tries to buy his silence. When Vinod decides to stand up to S.K., latter has him thrown out of his house by his landlord. Vinod's newspaper office, which used to be in the house, is destroyed. Sudha, who is ailing, dies on the road, leaving Vinod distraught. An disillusioned Vinod realizes that S.K. will always trump him, since people too support him. Instead of trying to expose S.K., Vinod now decides to follow S.K's footsteps. Vinod starts producing illicit liquor and doing other businesses. In short time, Vinod becomes a rich man.

Vinod is disturbed to learn that Raja is trying to dismantle his empire, but does not stop him. One day, however, Raja learns about Vinod's truth and confronts him. Vinod accepts the truth and tells him what happened. After pondering deeply, Raja decides that he will do what Vinod taught him, even if this means exposing his own mentor. Raja confesses to Vinod that he is still his mentor, upon which Vinod gives him his blessings. Here, Vinod and S.K's enmity reaches a head when Raja starts writing about both.
