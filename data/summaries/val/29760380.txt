Released from prison on parole, John Bradley plans to live alone quietly in a cabin in the country. In bursts a beautiful dishevelled woman in evening dress, Louise Loring, who has run away on foot from her rich protector, Tony Robson. With a sidekick, he pursues her and in a fracas the sidekick shoots Bradley’s dog. Bradley knocks out the sidekick and Robson reports this to the local sheriff, who wants Bradley back in jail. Tipped off by the sheriff’s daughter, Bradley and Loring flee to the New York flat of an old cellmate, Tommy Logan. Traced by the police, Bradley escapes with a bullet in his shoulder and Loring goes back to Robson, who hires a creepy lawyer to defend her. To worsen the case against Bradley and Loring, Robson decides the sidekick should die but the two burst in and expose his plot.
