Dimple Chaddha  is a spoilt brat and the only daughter of Sandeep Chaddha, the creator of "Chaddha Industries", a huge finance company in Delhi. Her boyfriend, Sunny Singh convinces her father that he really loves her. The next day, he breaks into an old bungalow and throws stones at it, harassing the residents. He explains his actions to Dimple: The bungalow he vandalized actually belongs to his father, who died recently, and it had been illegally encroached upon by the tenants. He has to pay thousands in taxes, lest he'd end up having to cede the ownership to the tenants. Dimple convinces her father to help Sunny gets his ancestral property back, to which Sandeep agrees. Unbeknownst to Sandeep, the family living there had a stay order and had a family dispute in the court for years, and there was no "Sunny Singh" involved, which meant that Sunny had conned Dimple. Dimple becomes heartbroken and tries tracing Sunny, who, in the meanwhile, is boarding a flight leaving for Mumbai, with the money he received by conning Dimple's father. Flash forward to today: In Mumbai, Ricky is working as a janitor. There, he spies on Raina Parulekar , who is a headstrong go-getter businesswoman in a big PR firm called Synergy Services. She has been ordered by her boss to adorn the central wall of their upcoming party with an M.F. Hussain painting, one with a herd of horses, which is sold out everywhere. Ricky attracts Raina's attention by a planned "chance" meeting, where he, pretending to be an art aficionado named "Deven Shah", tells her that he has been loaned that same painting for an art exhibition by a reputed businessman . Raina, desperate to deliver on her promise of having to deliver an M.F. Hussain painting within 72 hours, fails to identify the fake painting and falls into the trap laid by Deven. To buy the painting, she is made to deal with the owner of the painting, Mr. Suri, over the phone, as he is not available to meet at such short notice. Mr. Suri , after much deliberation, agrees to sell the painting for 90 Lakhs - 60 Lakhs in cash and 30 Lakhs in cheques, which he tells Raina to handover to the "honest and innocent Deven". She hands over Rs. 60 lakhs to Deven. At the grand party, the real "Mr. Suri" contacts Raina's boss and reprimands him over the phone for using his name in a transaction which never happened. Humiliated, Raina's boss immediately fires Raina for her ignorant mistake, accusing her of trying to con the company for Rs. 60 Lakhs. Humiliated, Raina reveals to the media about Deven Shah, who has duped her for a fake Hussain painting. Dimple, sitting in a beauty parlor in Delhi, sees the news on TV and suspects that maybe Deven Shah could be "Sunny". She contacts Raina, who instantly recognizes that Sunny Singh is indeed Deven Shah. Simultaneously, Raina receives another call from Lucknow from a widow named Saira Rashid , who explains her story of having been conned, for an amount of 10 Lakhs, by the same person under the guise of Iqbal Khan. Raina asks Dimple and Saira to come to Mumbai so that they can make a plan to find and con their common conman, who they simply name "Bloody Kameena " . To trace BK, Raina uses the help of one of her hacker friends, who sorts all prepaid numbers from around India which also have the same unique "caller tune" . They finally manage to identify his number and trace him to Goa, where he goes by the alias of "Diego Vaz". To set the plan in motion, Raina decides to hire an acquaintance. Enter Ishika : a really smart, sweet-talking and cunning saleswoman, who'd act as the daughter of an NRI American business tycoon, who wishes to open a restaurant in India and prove to father that she has business acumen. Once Raina, Dimple and Saira reach and find BK in Goa, they call Ishika over to Goa. As a part of their plan, they instruct Ishika to con BK into investing in the  restaurant by offering him a partnership proposal. BK, apparently unaware of the trap set for him, slowly starts falling for it. However, in the process of conning BK, Ishika falls in love with him, knowing well that BK, in turn, has also fallen in love with her. Ishika is tormented due to a fight between her promise towards the 3 girls vs the true love she has for BK. Ishika says she can't con him anymore because they love each other, but the 3 girls pressurize her. BK, unaware of the trap, comes to meet Ishika, only to find the 4 girls loudly arguing about him. He realizes that he has been setup all this while. He is heartbroken, and realizes the pain he gave to everyone when he conned them. But BK remains firm, and wanting vengeance for this "trap" the girls tried to set up for him, he now, in turn, makes a plan to con the four girls. Because he truly loves her, BK confesses he's a conman and wants to leave this life behind, and wants to marry Ishika. The girls set up a fake "father" of Ishika, who orders BK to buy a plot in the name of Ishika, so she can be safe in case BK absconds. BK agrees, but since he does not have enough cash, he asks Ishika to lend him half  of the plot's worth . The deal is made and all the property papers are transferred to Ishika. But they soon realize that this was all a con by BK : He bought the worthless "swamp" plot for 3 Lakhs under a fake alias, then asked the agent to sell that same land to Ishika  for 90 Lakhs. That way, the money  which Ishika had conned out of BK would come back to him. The 3 girls blame Ishika for cheating them, and vent their anger out on her. Ishika leaves and returns back to Mumbai. The three return to pack up and leave, only to find BK sitting in their garden. He explains why he came back, that he didn't feel good about conning the girl he truly loved, and that the four girls have changed him into now becoming an honest and decent man. He returns their money - Rs. 1 crore - he stole from the three combined, and leaves. The three girls realize BK's and Ishika's love for each other and reunite them. He lands up in Mumbai, confronts Ishika and proposes to her. In the end, on being probed by Ishika, BK reveals his real name to be "Ricky Bahl", and the movie ends with them embracing and kissing each other.
