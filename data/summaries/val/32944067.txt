In Italy, Dr Ceneri gives money to support Garibaldi, including money meant for his orphaned niece and nephew Pauline and Anthony. When they grow up, they learn of what he did with the money, and Anthony is killed by the villainous Macari. This is seen by Pauline who goes insane, and the blind Gilbert Vaughan. Vaughan regains his sight, Pauline regains her sanity, and they are married while Macari is arrested.
