As the Nazis invade Holland in 1940, Corrie and her family allow Jews to hide in a part of their home that is specially remodeled by members of the Dutch resistance. However, the Nazis eventually discover that Corrie and her family are hiding Jews, and on February 29, 1944, the family and their friends are arrested after their betrayal by a Dutch collaborator. The hidden Jews are never found. Corrie's father, Casper, dies before he reaches the concentration camp, and Corrie worries that she will never see her home again. The Nazis send Corrie and her sister, Betsie, to the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp in Germany for hiding Jews in their home. At the concentration camp, Betsie encourages Corrie to remain hopeful that God will rescue them from the brutalities they experience. With little food and constant work, the women suffer constantly, and Corrie's sister Betsie , dies. Ultimately, Corrie  leaves the camp through what is discovered years later to have been a clerical error, as everyone in her group of prisoners was marked for gassing the following month . Her life after this ordeal was dedicated to showing that the love of Jesus is greater than the deepest pit into which humankind finds itself.
