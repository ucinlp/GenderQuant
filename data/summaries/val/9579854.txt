Whipple "Whip" Hoxworth  returns home to Hawaii to find his grandfather has died and left his fortune to Hoxworth's cousin, Micah Hale . Hoxworth, the black sheep of his otherwise very conservative and disapproving family, starts a plantation, staffing it with newly-arrived Chinese indentured servants Nyuk Tsin  and her man Mun Ki . Mun Ki fathers children with Nyuk Tsin, all the while dreaming of returning to China and his wife. Nyuk Tsin, named "Wu Chow's Auntie" to support the fiction that Mun Ki's spouse is the real mother of the children, has other ideas. Whip steals valuable pineapples from French Guiana in the hope that they will grow in Hawaii. He gives the forlorn plants to Wu Chow's Auntie, knowing that she has a "green thumb". When she succeeds in nurturing the plants into flourishing, the overjoyed Whip offers to buy her some land as a reward. Over Mun Ki's opposition, she accepts. This is the first step in the rise of both Whip and Wu Chow's Auntie, as well as the pineapple industry in Hawaii. Meanwhile, Whip marries native Hawaiian Purity  and has a son with her. However, because of her royal, inbred background, she is mentally fragile. Eventually, her mind gives way, and she can no longer abide to live with Whip. Their son Noel  grows to manhood with an uneasy relationship with his father. When Mun Ki contracts leprosy, Wu Chow's Auntie accompanies him to the leper colony on Molokai. Upon Mun Ki's death years later, she returns to be reunited and reacquainted with her now-grown, educated, and prospering children. A complication arises when Noel falls in love with Wu Chow's Auntie's only daughter. Neither parent approves of the idea of the marriage, but in the end, they grudgingly accept it.
