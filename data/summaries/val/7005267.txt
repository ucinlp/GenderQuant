In 1916, as U.S. soldiers wage war against Pancho Villa's Mexican troops, Army Major Thomas Thorn  is assigned to be a battlefield observer and reward heroism. He has been suggested for this duty by a Colonel Rogers , who is 63 years old and impatiently yearning to be promoted to general. Rogers commands his unit to make a poorly planned, old-fashioned Cavalry charge on a villa owned by Adelaide Geary  where a number of Villa's men have been staying, enjoying her hospitality. Thorn, excused from the fighting, observes through his binoculars various acts of heroism by Lt. Fowler , Sgt. Chawk , Cpl. Trubee  and Pvt. Renziehausen  in defeating Villa's men, although not before many U.S. soldiers are slaughtered. Rogers is proud of having personally led the charge, but furious when Thorn won't nominate him for a citation. Thorn insists that a commanding officer cannot be honored for a command decision he himself made. Rogers counted on the fact that he saved Thorn from an investigation into a charge of cowardice from a previous engagement, saying he did so out of respect for Thorn's father. Thorn intends to recommend the four soldiers for the Congressional Medal of Honor. He is ordered to take along the traitorous female prisoner, Mrs. Geary, who is charged with "giving aid and comfort to the enemy." A fifth soldier, a private  also nominated by Thorn for a medal, rides with them to the Texas town of Cordura. This seemingly simple task becomes increasingly complex, however, as the incessant squabbling between Thorn and the men threatens to destroy them all. Eager to learn more about their acts of bravery, Thorn finds the men to be hostile toward him, ill-mannered toward the woman and, in some cases, heroic merely due to a desire to survive the warfare. They ultimately turn against Thorn, forcing him to fight fellow soldiers to save his own life.
