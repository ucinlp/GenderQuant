The plot concerns the Legion of the Winged Serpent, a rogue group of human-like aliens led by Captain Rameses  who wish to invade Earth with their fleet of flying saucers before life on their own planet becomes untenable because their sun is about to go supernova. They plan to kill all humans on Earth through the use of an orbiting transmitter whose signals prompt people to commit suicide. Opposing this plan is the Intergalactic League of Races, another highly advanced group of bald, big-headed aliens based in a golden pyramid deep beneath Earth's ocean. Due to acts of assassination and sabotage that leaves their robots destroyed, their forces depleted and their base in enemy hands, the League of Races seeks help from UFO expert Professor Allan Duncan  to save the Earth. Their efforts culminate in a battle between the League and Rameses' saucers deep in space.
