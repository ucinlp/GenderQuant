Josie  is a good-natured man with learning difficulties who lives and works at a garage in a small rural Irish village called Rathcabbin in County Tipperary. The owner, called Mr Gallagher, is a former school classmate who is not interested in the garage and is only waiting for the right offer from developers so he can sell. For Josie, one day rolls into the next with nothing but his menial job and a few pints in the local pub, even though the regulars mock him and his ways. Kind-hearted Josie's only other companion is a large horse that is tethered alone in a field. When he visits, he talks to the animal and brings it an apple. However one day his boss hires his girlfriend's 15-year-old son, David  to help Josie. Slowly Josie connects with David as they endure the slow and menial pace of the garage. One night after work, Josie innocently shares some beers with David. They sit and watch the sunset at the rear of the garage. Josie joins David and other local teenagers down by the railway tracks, bringing beer for all of them. The new social aspects to his life lift his confidence. At the local pub, he gets the courage to dance with Carmel, the local shopkeeper. But she shows her cynicism for Josie by explicitly telling him she feels no physical attraction towards him; not realising that Josie's innocuous intentions were purely friendly and innocent. The friendship between Josie and David progresses nicely until one fateful day after work he shows David a pornographic film, which he received from a trucker who frequents the petrol station. David feels uncomfortable and leaves. Josie, sensing something is wrong, follows him outside but is unable to clarify the situation. David returns the following week but does not stay after work. Instead he leaves with a local boy who openly mocks and despises Josie because he is different. Nevertheless Josie offers him a beer and a cheerful goodbye. The next day, the local Garda√≠ come to the garage and take Josie to the police station because there has been "a complaint". The boy who was with David, told David's mother that Josie had supplied her son with alcohol and shown him pornography. After an interview with a sympathetic officer, Josie explains it was just a bit of "craic" and "pure innocent". No charges are brought and he is released. But he is told to stay away from the town and especially to avoid contact with David. Josie returns to the garage. While eating dinner, he suddenly realises what has happened. Shocked he puts his head in hands all alone in his little room at the back of the garage. The next day Mr Gallagher comes to the garage. Although not explicitly stated, Josie is told that he or the garage are finished. Unable to sleep that night, Josie get dressed and sits on the edge of his bed. He then goes down to the river at dawn and sits for a while on the bank. Josie then takes off his well-polished shoes and socks before neatly placing his garage cap on them. He then wades slowly into the water arms outstretched. The lonely horse, which was tethered in a field, has been cut free. It stops and looks directly into the camera as the screen fades to black.
