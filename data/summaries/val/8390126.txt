Con men Eddie Farrel  and Lou Pesquino  need cash fast and pretend to be repair men sent to fix a gas leak. The con fails, but they escape. Eddie and Lou find an empty house that they decide to burglarize. When they learn from a message on the answering machine that the owner is out of the country and the man who was going to house-sit can't make it, they spend the night. The next day, Eddie and Lou are on the run from thugs sent by local gangster Sal Nichols , to whom they owe money. After they find themselves separated, Eddie takes refuge in the empty house. In the morning, Eddie walks out of the shower and meets Mona Malkin , whose son owns the house. She assumes Eddie is her son's friend Jonathan Albertson, the one supposed to house-sit. Eddie plays along, meeting Mona's businessman husband Milt , who offers him a job. Eddie decides to run a "love con" on Milt's daughter Annie  in order to gain access to Milt's money. However, Lou is captured by Nichols. Eddie and his aunt and uncle  conspire to get Nichols off their backs for good. Along the way, Eddie falls in love with Annie.
