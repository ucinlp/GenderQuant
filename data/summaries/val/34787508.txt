The story is about Dr. Baldev Chaddha , a fertility expert, who runs a fertility clinic and a sperm bank in Daryaganj, Delhi, that guarantees high quality and specialized sperm for the couples without issue. Unfortunately, he has more failed cases to his credit than successes. A healthy and high-performing donor is therefore need of the hour. While searching for his 'Indian Alexander', Chaddha bumps into Vicky Arora . Vicky is an only son of his widowed mother Dolly, who runs a small parlor from their home in Lajpat Nagar. He provides no financial support to her. As luck would have it, a small brawl in the colony brings Chaddha and Vicky face to face, where Chaddha concludes that Vicky could be the donor he has been looking for. From here on, Chaddha's days and nights are spent in convincing Vicky to become a donor until he finally gives in. Vicky falls in love with Ashima Roy , a Bengali who works in a bank. Despite initial rivalry between Vicky and Ashima's families due to conflicting cultures, they eventually convince their families and get happily married. It is discovered in the progress that Ashima is infertile and Vicky, with a heavy heart, takes better care of her. Soon their world comes crashing down because of Vicky's past as a sperm donor, which Ashima can not digest. She moves back to her father's house at Kolkata. For the 25th anniversary of Chaddha's clinic, Vicky convinces Ashima to attend. On the day, all the children who were born out of Vicky's sperm are present , and Ashima realises that Vicky was responsible for the happiness brought to the parents of these children. In the end, they adopt a child who was sired by Vicky but whose foster parents have since died in an accident. Vicky and Ashima reunite and live happily. Also, Dr. Chaddha convinces Vicky to donate his sperm for one last time.
