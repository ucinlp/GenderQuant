Chicago residents Neil Randall  and his wife, Abby Randall  have the perfect life and a perfect marriage. With their beautiful young daughter, Sophie, they are living the American dream... until today. When Sophie is suddenly kidnapped, they have no choice but to comply with the abductor's demands. The kidnapper, Tom Ryan , a cold and calculating sociopath, takes over their lives with the brutal efficiency of someone who has nothing to lose. In the blink of an eye, Neil and Abby's safe and secure existence is turned upside down. Over the next twenty-four hours they are at the mercy of a man who wants only one thing: that they do his bidding. It soon becomes clear that Ryan's demands are all the more terrifying because he doesn't want their money. What he wants is Neil and Abby's life, the life they have built over 10 years, to be systematically dismantled and destroyed, piece by piece. With time running out on their little girl, Neil and Abby realize their nightmare is just about to begin. They will have to submit to Ryan's challenges over the next 24 hour period. How far will they go to save the life of their child? They are asked to withdraw money from the bank which Tom burns and throws along with their wallets out of the car. They have to get $300 from nowhere in a part of the town where they don't have any friends. Abby pledges her bracelet and Neil his watch which gets them the $300. They are then asked to deliver a courier to some place within 20 min, and Tom reveals to Neil that the cover contains dirty details of Neil's job, which if leaked will ruin Neil. This goes on, with efforts by them to rescue Sophie from the Hotel, only to get caught by Tom, who makes Abby strip and change in front of them, etc. The denouement is revealed only in the last few minutes. Neil and Tom's wife  are colleagues at work and have been having an affair for a while: and Tom has come to know of it. On that day, Neil and Judy were planning to meet for a rendezvous. Tom wants to put Neil through the pain he had undergone and surprisingly Abby plays along with his plan. Neil lies to Abby when they are returning home that someone else was having an affair with Judy and Tom mistook Neil to be that person, which is why Tom had tormented them the whole day. Abby reveals the details at the very end to Neil, that in truth their daughter has not been kidnapped, she knows of the affair between Neil and Judy, the cover delivered contained only blank sheets, etc. Abby is paying back Neil the pain she went through on learning of the affair and played the game along with Tom.
