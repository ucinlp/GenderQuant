The story is centered on a puppy named Fluke , who has flashing memories and dreams of a human life. After being taken to a pound, and eventually escaping from it, he is raised by an elderly homeless woman named Bella , who gives him the name Fluke, stating that he's "a fluke by nature, and by name." After Bella dies of an illness caused by poor conditions, he befriends a street-wise St. Bernard-like dog named Rumbo . During this time he matures into an adult dog , and he eventually realizes that he used to be a workaholic named Thomas P. Johnson  who died in a car crash. Fluke is then abducted by a man named Sylvester  to be used in animal experiments at a cosmetics company. During the tests, Rumbo comes to the rescue. Rumbo is shot by Sylvester as he and Fluke escape. A dying Rumbo tells Fluke that the black-and-white snapshot of a man in a sailor suit was him. He's also told that as a human, Bert   was his brother and that he wishes to smell the sea again, suggesting that he died in the line of duty. After Rumbo's death, Fluke seeks out his wife  and son  and reunites with them as their dog. Fluke tries to show them who he used to be, at the same time suspecting that his human death was caused by his former business partner Jeff Newman . It's during his time among them as a dog that he gets to know his family better and bitterly realizes that he was an emotionally distant workaholic. However, he comes close to killing Jeff, but at the last minute has a flashback and realizes that Jeff wasn't involved in his death - his death was caused by his own recklessness. Fluke finally manages to point out to his wife who he really is . With a heavy heart, he decides it's better to move on; the man he used to be is dead and gone. So he leaves his family, never seeing them again. He realizes that life is simply meant to be cherished, regardless of how one lives it. Far away, Fluke is resting under a tree by himself. To his surprise, he encounters Rumbo, who is now reincarnated as a squirrel.
