The animation begins as avuncular and humorous Professor Toto invites his class to watch a cartoon about a day in the life of a boy named Eric. Eric describes what he is doing, “I comb my hair,” “I put on my socks,” “I put on my shoes,” “I drink hot chocolate,” “Dad drinks coffee,” and “Mom drinks tea,” in school, lunchtime, park, snack time, dinner, and bedtime environments. Then the professor introduces his class to more foreign language words and images periodically prompting viewers to repeat and asking review questions such as “what is the cat wearing?” The animation introduces animals, clothing, colors, body parts, foods, action verbs, adjectives, prepositions, places, directions, shapes, sports, musical instruments, time, months, and seasons.
