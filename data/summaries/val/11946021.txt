A series of characters of the same species as Goofy are playing a game of college basketball, with one team representing "U.U." and the other representing the hopelessly outmatched and undersized "P.U." The short primarily focuses on a wide gamut of physically impossible and illegal stunts taken by each team. In the end, P.U. wins the match on a last-second shot that sends a U.U. player through the basket . The game ends with the lone fan in the stands, presumably Goofy himself, singing the P.U. alma mater. (When the series was edited for television, this character was voiced by Jeff Bennett with a much different voice, more closely resembling the voice of Mr. Smee from Disney adaptations of [[Peter Pan
