{{cquote2}} The Heart of Texas is the story of Grover Norwood and Ulice Parker. When tragedy pierces the heart of a small community on the quiet Texas plains, its townspeople witness what can happen when grace and forgiveness triumph over angiush and outrage. Against the traffic of our crowded lives, a story of such forgiveness can seem more of a work of fiction...yet every moment of this story is true.http://www.heartoftexasthemovie.com/index.html
