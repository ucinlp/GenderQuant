{{plot}} The plot revolves around an awkward, lonely young woman named May Dove Canady , who suffered a troubled childhood due to her lazy eye. She has very few social interactions, her only "true friend" being a glass-encased doll named Suzie made by her mother and given to May for her birthday. While presenting young May with the gift, her mother tells her, "If you can't find a friend, make one." As an adult, May works at a veterinary hospital, assisting with surgeries. Her optometrist fixes May's lazy eye, first with glasses, then with a special form of contact lens. As May attempts to be more social, she sees Adam , a local mechanic, around town, they become friends. When she tells him that she's weird, Adam replies, "That's okay. I like weird." May has a fixation on his hands, which she considers to be the most attractive part of him, and they start dating. Meanwhile, May's lesbian colleague Polly  begins to flirt with May, while simultaneously poking fun at her for her oddness. One day while feeling especially low, May remarks that Polly has a beautiful neck. Polly then gives her pet cat Lupe to May, ostensibly because of her "bitch" landlord. One night May invites Adam to her apartment. Adam shows her a film he made for his university titled Jack and Jill. The film reveals a story of two young lovers who go on a picnic and end up eating each other. May becomes aroused by the cannibalism in the film, and during an intense make-out session, she gets carried away and bites Adam on the lip. Bleeding profusely, Adam is finally disturbed by May's strange personality and leaves. May feels guilty and blames her doll Suzie for encouraging her to make bad choices. She shouts at Suzie and shoves her in the cupboard. May begins working at a school for disabled children. She is especially interested in the blind children and identifies with a lonely girl named Petey David, who makes her a clay ashtray with May's name carved into it. May finally gives in to Polly's wiles and starts a short affair. After Adam stops calling her, May goes to his house and overhears him and a friend calling her a loony. Adam says he's glad he could get rid of May. Heartbroken, May goes to see Polly, only to find Polly with another girl named Ambrosia. Totally miserable, May returns home. When Lupe refuses to come near her, she becomes enraged and throws the clay ashtray, killing Lupe. May becomes delusional, thinking that her doll Suzie is talking to her through its glass case. May takes Suzie to school and tells the blind children that Suzie is her best friend. As the children struggle curiously to take the doll out of the glass case, it falls and shatters resulting in the kids and May cutting themselves on all the glass in the process. Carrying the now-destroyed, blood-covered Suzie, May returns home, devastated. The following day, May meets a punk boy named Blank . He is interested in her remarks that people cannot be entirely perfect, only have perfect "parts". May doesn't like Blank, but she likes the tattoo on his arm. They go to May's house and when he opens the freezer to get ice, he finds the cat's corpse wrapped in plastic wrap. Blank panics and calls May a freak, infuriating her; she stabs him in the head with a pair of scissors. Suddenly, she realizes that the people she had considered her friends were not friends at all; there were only parts of them that were friends. She concludes that a perfect friend can only be made of all the perfect parts of people. On Halloween night, May dresses in a homemade costume similar to Suzie's dress and goes to Polly's house, adopting a completely "normal" manner. She kills Polly with scalpels from the animal hospital. When Ambrosia arrives, May admires her legs and asks her to turn around for her. Ambrosia accepts, not without calling May a freak first and making derisive comments about her and Polly's previous relationship. May stabs Ambrosia with the scalpels. When May goes to Adam's house, she finds him with Hoop, a girl with hoop earrings. May asks Adam to touch her face. He indignantly pokes May's forehead, at which point May stabs Hoop in the neck. She then stabs Adam in the stomach. Back at home, May designs her "new friend", Amy, a Frankenstein-esque life-sized rag doll made from Blank's arms, Polly's neck, Adam's hands, Ambrosia's legs, Hoop's ears, and Lupe's fur to substitute for hair. The head and torso are different scraps of fabric stitched together and stuffed. Once the macabre doll is finished, May realizes that Amy can't see her. In a rush of misery, May gouges out her right eye, the lazy one, with the scissors. Crying in pain and bleeding, she puts her eye on Amy's head and begs the doll to look at her. A dying May sees her friend come to life and touch her face lovingly with Adam's treasured hands. May smiles, and the credits roll.
