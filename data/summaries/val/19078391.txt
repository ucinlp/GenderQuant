An orphan boy in 1830's London is abused in a workhouse, then falls into the clutches of a gang of thieves.  Despite the fact that the Sowerberrys and Noah Claypole appear in the cast list, the entire Sowerberry sequence is omitted from this film, as is Monks, Oliver's half-brother. Rose Maylie becomes Brownlow's daughter in this version, and it is Brownlow's house that Skes attempts to rob. It is possible that early releases of this film did include Noah Claypole and the Sowerberrys.
