Oswald is a penniless vagabond who comes out of one of the train's cars after it made a stop. As he steps out of the train, Oswald saw a guard passing by. Therefore, he hurries back inside and shuts the door. But because Oswald's baggage  was left outside, the suspicious guard decides to inspect the train. When the guard opens the door and peeps in, Oswald, coming out from another exit, kicks the officer in and makes a run for it. Wondering on the countryside, the hungry Oswald saw a homeless bear camping under a tree. The two met and befriended each other. They then started to fry an egg using the camp fire and other limited equipment that they have. While Oswald and the bear couldn't agree on how they should have the fried egg, a squirrel pops out from the tree and snatches it from them. The two uneasy friends were left wondering what they should do next. Suddenly, they saw roasted chicken on a window sill of a nearby house. The bear tells Oswald to filch it. Oswald was initially reluctant but ultimately agrees after getting strangled by the bear. The rabbit entered the house's yard and approaches the window, only to be chased out of the gate by the resident dog. Oswald came with another idea when he noticed the clothesline connects between the gate and the window. The plan worked and Oswald got his hands on the roasted chicken. Upon exiting the gate, he was spotted by a patrolling cop, prompting him to leave quickly. Passing by his friend, Oswald tosses the food to the bear who catches it. The rabbit figured he'd rather run to somewhere than to be tormented by the cop. When the bear was about to take a bite of the roasted chicken, the cop, approaching from behind, swipes it in the blink of an eye. The surprised bear then looks around and notices the cop pointing a gun at him. He too flees. As they walk away together, Oswald and the bear pointed fingers at each other over not having to eat anything. Meanwhile, the cop carries the roasted chicken and puts it back on the window sill. Just then, the dog, watching from one of the house's corners, thought another act of pilferage was taking place. In this, the dog chases the cop down the road, passing by Oswald and the bear who are enjoying the incident.
