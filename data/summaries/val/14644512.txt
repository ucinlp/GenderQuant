George, a chronic hypochondria, wakes up in the morning after a series of dreams dealing with health issues and takes his daily pills. His wife, Judy, locks herself out of the house when receiving a delivery from the milk man. She made her way in at the side window and makes breakfast. Judy gossips to George about the Bullardâ€™s divorce with many false assumptions about the split. When he experiences chest pains, George goes to the hospital for a checkup and overhears his doctor discussing the diagnosis of a terminally ill patient who had two weeks to live with an associate. He assumes that Dr. Morrissey was talking about him and was distraught. On the train back home he tells his friend, Arnold that he will die soon and decided to not tell Judy knowing it will upset her. At night he dreamed about Judy marring Vito who is only out for their money. Worried about her, he made plans before his death. He visited a funeral home operated by Mr. Adkins to buy a burial plot. There he gets the idea that he should seek a husband for Judy. He asks Arnold to help him find a new husband for his wife so he will know she is taken care of. On a golfing trip Judy's go- cart malfunctions and is saved by her old college beau Bert, now a Texas oil baron. George agreed with Arnold that he will be great for Judy. During the night out, George forces Judy to dance and talk to Bert. When George ran into Linda Bullard, she kissed him thanking him for the conversation. When Judy sees them she walks out, thinking that the only reason he is pushing her to spend time with Bert is to have an affair with Linda. He then tells her that he is dying. Upset, Judy puts George in a wheelchair. When Dr. Morrissey made a visit and tells her that he is fine, she thinks George is lying to get out of his affair. She rolls him out of the house locking him out. The next day Judy left to buy a train ticket. At the train station he tells her that he is dying and had bought a burial plot. Thinking it is another lie she went home to get her bags. When Mr. Akins delivered the burial contracts, she realized that George was telling the truth and forgives him.
