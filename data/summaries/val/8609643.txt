13 year old Patty Bergen lives in Jenkinsville, Arkansas, during World War II. Patty's family owns the local clothing and general supplies store, in which Patty occasionally works. Patty's abusive father and uncaring mother have little time for her, instead favoring her younger sister Sharon. However, Patty does have a friend in the family's black, middle-aged housekeeper, Ruth. The U.S. government opens a prisoner-of-war  camp for captured German soldiers in the town, and one day Patty meets one of the POWs: Anton Friedrich Reiker  when the POWs are allowed to buy supplies from her family's store. Soon after, Anton escapes from the POW camp and is on the run. He is about to escape on a train when Patty sees him and scuppers his plans. Rather than inform the authorities, Patty hides the young soldier in some abandoned rooms above the family's disused garage and brings him food. The two become close friends, Anton showing Patty a warmth and respect that she never had from her cold family. Anton nearly gets exposed when he sees Patty's father beating her one day and nobly runs out of hiding to protect her, but she shouts for him to go back before he is seen. However, Ruth sees Anton. She does not approve but agrees to keep Patty's secret and helps by giving Anton food. Before long, the FBI begin conducting a thorough search of the town looking for Anton. When they call at the Bergens' home, Patty runs out to the garage to warn Anton that he must leave immediately or he will be caught. Anton flees from the garage after thanking Patty for her help and gives her a valuable ring that belonged to his grandfather. However, whilst trying to leave town that night, the FBI find Anton and he is shot dead trying to escape. Patty is virtually disowned by her father, who tells her that she is dead to him, and by all of the townsfolk, who view her as a traitor for aiding a German prisoner. The only person who still talks to her is Ruth, who has now been fired from her job as housekeeper, and who tries to comfort Patty in her grief. Ruth tells the townsfolk to leave Patty alone as only God has the right to stand in judgment of her.
