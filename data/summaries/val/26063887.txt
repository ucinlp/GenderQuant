Kong Lik-son was born with the ability to see ghosts and spirits. One day, he sees a restless soul, Mrs Chung, who is looking for a human replacement. Kong provokes Chung because he spoils her plan when he saves Ying-ying, and she keeps haunting him. Kong goes to find Mrs Bud Lung to help him, and she tells him that he had disrupted the Yin and Yang balance when he saved Ying-ying's life. Mrs Chung had drowned during her pregnancy and she needs to find a human body for her unborn son to possess and be reborn. Mrs Bud asks Bud Gay and Ying-ying to bring Mrs Chung to the lakeside and wait for transmigrants.
