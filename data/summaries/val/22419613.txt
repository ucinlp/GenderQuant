Diamonds of the Night begins with two young men fleeing from a train and hiding in the woods. Through the course of their journey, flashbacks shed light on their past; the boys are fleeing from a Nazi train on its way to a concentration camp. During their escape, they encounter a woman on a farm. One boy struggles with thoughts of murder and rape before silently taking a loaf of bread from the woman's kitchen and leaving. Eventually, the boys are caught by members of a local shooting party. The men prepare to execute the boys, but simply laugh as they walk away instead of executing them. The ending is ambiguous: The men either actually spared the boys, or they could be walking into the afterlife.
