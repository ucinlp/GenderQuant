Rambling U. cheerleaders  work together to keep State U. from stealing Rambling’s star football players. State’s Mr. Langley — on behalf of Coach Wilson — takes the players on a trip to Bell Harbor, to convince them that State has much more to offer.  Rambling’s Coach Hensen does not see anything he can do to stop it, given Rambling’s limited resources, so the four girls take it on themselves to do whatever is required to convince the players to stay at Rambling. 1970s-era sex-comedy high jinks ensue as the girls compete with stuck-up State cheerleaders to get their players back. The Rambling U. cheerleaders succeed by infiltrating parties and meetings with sex, disguises and drugs. Not only do they keep their players, but they recruit State's star players, Mitch Stevens and Stanley Kraus, to boot.
