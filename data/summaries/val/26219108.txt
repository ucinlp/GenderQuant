The story is set in Africa. Two rival European governments have sent secret agents to the uncivilized kingdom of M'tela. British agent John Culbertson  survives an attempt on his life and leads a safari from Bajuma, on the edge of the desert, to the savage kingdom. An agent of the rival government, Madame , who is known as the "Leopard Woman," is also leading a safari to M'tela. Her mission is to prevent the Englishman from reaching the kingdom. The two parties meet in the desert. The Leopard Woman's men are exhausted and dehydrated and she is forced to seek Culbertson's help. The Leopard Woman then feigns illness and manages to fulfill her promise to delay Culbertson. Although her government has given her orders to kill him, she falls in love with him. After they make love, he spurns her. She is enraged and orders her servant, Chaké , to kill him. The attempt fails, however, and the Leopard Woman is relieved. She has decided that she really loves him after all. Culbertson then loses his sight due to overexposure to the sun and his progress is delayed further. The Leopard Woman smashes his bottle of medicine in the hope of forcing him to return to Bajuma. Despite his blindness, Culbertson is determined to complete his mission and goes on to M'tela. With the help of a record player, Culbertson forms an alliance between the primitive tribe and Britain. Choosing love over her duty as a foreign rival, the Leopard Woman sends Chaké to find the British military surgeon. When his sight is restored, Culbertson declares his love for her.
