Pocahontas is the daughter of the Algonquian chief Powhatan; one day, she is out playing in the woods near the shore when she spots a strange ship filled with white men. When they notice her, she runs away in alarm and tells her father and her people all about the new arrivals. Powhatan's tribe begins to worry; they have terrible memories of the last time the "pale faces" arrived in their land. Some of the younger men suggest attacking the white men and sending them back to where they came from, but Powhatan feels that these new men should not have to pay for the mistakes or cruelty of others in the past. He suggests everyone stay away from them, and to not harm them in any way, but to continue living their lives within their lands until they know what the settlers are up to. Eventually, the young Pocahontas befriends Captain John Smith, and the two become fast friends. Captain Smith is a friendly man and desires peace, but neither he nor Pocahontas can prevent a growing hatred between the two groups. Some of the Indians, feeling that Powhatan has grown weak, decide to abandon the tribe and start their own, with new laws. The ones that remain allow themselves to be taught many things by the white men, including new sports and useful everyday things. As winter begins to approach, the two groups face difficult problems; the Indians believe that the white men are purposely hunting all of their animals and that they may soon be left to starve, while the white men fear they may not survive unless they're invited to spend the winter safely in this new land, rather than sail back to England. The wisdom and good heart of young Pocahontas becomes the key to the collaboration between the two different groups of people in order to survive those difficult times.
