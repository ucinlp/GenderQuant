Jack  was left a mute simpleton after a car accident. After being institutionalized for a year, Jack is released. As Halloween is approaching, Jack decides to carve a pumpkin, but the gourd had been taken over by an evil force and begins to bleed. Over the next 4 days, Jack lapses into occasional catatonic states, during which time the group of friends who had caused the earlier accident, are murdered one-by-one by a deformed Jack O' Lantern creature.
