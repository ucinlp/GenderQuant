Thirty-two year old Scott is the son of a rich businessman, who runs a modern bridal salon. Scott is a sluggish and hedonistic gentleman and a lot of ladies are willing to surrender themselves to him. He's the most sought after bachelor in town. He dislikes to be restrained by either family or marriage. His life is all about efficiency and he's excellent at making decisions and accomplishing tasks in 3 minutes. In Scott's list of the most disgusting things on earth, kids are considered the all time Number one. However, during a rehearsal of a wedding gown show, Scott mistakenly took a six-year old child, Wayne, as a thief of his wallet, but the kid suddenly calls him dad.
