During a radio interview on BBC Radio 4's PM programme, Minister for International Development Simon Foster  accidentally states that a war in the Middle East is "unforeseeable". He is told off for not remaining neutral by the Prime Minister's enforcer Malcolm Tucker . But when later caught by news cameras Foster makes a further mistake by saying there may be a need to "climb the mountain of conflict". The two contradictory statements coincide with a visit by senior U.S. State Department officials, who jump on Foster's two quotations and begin to use him, and his hapless new aide Toby , as pawns in an international political game.Xan Brooks, Iannucci's Iraq war satire lauded at Sundance in The Guardian, 21 January 2009.
