Frinton is Under Secretary of State at the Foreign Office. The marquess is a longtime horse owner who has his heart set on winning the Ascot Gold Cup. This year his horse, named June 10  is the favourite and does indeed win. Lord Frinton is presented the Gold Cup by King George V. However, his elation is blighted when he finds his wife with her lover and his underling, John Fane  in the back of the Rolls with the shades drawn. For appearance's sake, Lord Frinton will not divorce his wife, but he returns the car. 20,023 miles later, Genoa, Italy — The Rolls, according to G. Bomba, owner of the Genova Auto Salon was “owned by a Maharajah, who lost his money at the San Remo Casino.” The Rolls is purchased by American gangster Paolo Maltese . He is touring Italy with his bored fiancée Mae Jenkins  and his right-hand man Joey Friedlander . When Maltese returns to Miami to take care of some unsavory business, he leaves Joey to chaperone Jenkins. Friedlander turns a blind eye when she falls in love with Stefano , a handsome young street photographer. Upon finding Jenkins and Stefano in the back of the Rolls with the shades drawn, Friedlander walks away. But he later shows Jenkins an eight-day-old American newspaper headline, Bugs O’ Leary Slain—Police Claim Gang Warfare, that was Paolo’s business in the United States.

However, none of his men know how to drive, so Millett volunteers, much to Davich’s surprise. They survive a German aerial attack and reach their destination. Along the way, these two very different people fall in love. Millett and Davich get in the back of the Rolls and draw the shades down. She wants to stay and help repel the invaders, but Davich will not permit it, saying it is not her fight. He tells her to go back to America and tell people what she has witnessed.
