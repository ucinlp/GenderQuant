The film opens with an elderly man  leaving a rushed and emotional, voice message to his partner of 30 years. The Patient implies that an insidious person from his distant past  has shown up and this person is very dangerous. The Patient has decided to run out on the good life he has had for so long, to leave his lover and everything they have behind to keep his partner out of harms way. When The Patient finishes his message and prepares to leave he suffers from delirum, and he sees an orange fishtank with devil horns and eats it. In this moment The Patient drifts off into his subconscious mind, into his past. As this happens the "elderly" Patient's apartment fades away into a bright white light that reveals a large ominous building perched on a jagged cliff side, overlooking the sea... Two voices appear over the scene, one is of The Patient  and the other is a sadistic man known only as "The Doctor" . The Doctor states the he has been administering an experimental drug called "Psychotropica" to The Patient and mercilessly interrogating him about a traumatic and off kilter "nightmare" for quite sometime now  The Patient is obviously in great emotional and psychological stress and does not wish to continue the "treatment" but The Doctor forces him to continue for "as long as it takes" under threat of severe "punishment." Reluctantly The Patient agrees to continue relating his painful nightmare for The Doctor. The Patient takes a deep breath and begins his psychological "trip"... As The Patient begins, the scene fades into an odd neon landscape, that features a never ending "highway of the mind", glowing green plasma mountains and billowing technicolor clouds that flow relentlessly in the sky. The Patient can now be seen standing off in the distance of this dreamscape. We move slowly past him and into the sky. We travel through the vast reaches of space and time at great speed until we are thrust into the first major segment of The Patient's "nightmare"... From here on out the film plays like a dream would, jumping wildly in tone and style, from the past to the present, each segment related in some meaningful way to the ones before and after. The dream logic of the film is only interrupted by brief interludes of The Patient setting up and describing each part of his "nightmare." Most of this nightmare revolves around The Patient's tumultuous relationship with his sadistic Stepbrother and Sister  and his efforts to break away from them and their violent life together. Along the way there are visually stylish dreams with dreams, a pulse pounding psychadelic sex scene between the step brother and sister, an extended Evil Dead homage that segues into an epic animated sequence that pits The Patient's conflicting "light and dark" sides against one another. There are also moments of unmitigating violence, black comedy, brutal fights and visually stunning weirdness; all building up to an emotionally and psychologically explosive final act where all the secrets of the "nightmare", The Doctor and The Patient are revealed.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1433331/
