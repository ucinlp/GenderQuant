Shortly after escaping the planet from Pitch Black, Riddick, Jack, and Imam are picked up by a ship. They quickly discover that it's a mercenary ship. Although Riddick attempts to conceal his identity from the mercenaries by impersonating William J. Johns  over the intercom, they quickly voice-print and identify him. Captured by the mercenaries, the trio of survivors discover that their captors have unusual plans for them. The ship's owner, Antonia Chillingsworth , collects criminals, whom she freezes and keeps as statues that are, in her view, art. Although the criminals are frozen, they are alive and conscious. To her Riddick is the ultimate "masterpiece" for her collection. Riddick, Jack, and Imam must fight their way through the army of human and alien creatures at her disposal or they will meet a fate crueler than death. Riddick is pursued much of the story by Toombs and his mercenarys/bounty hunters. Mercenary soldiers are kept in suspended animation until they are needed. They are released to confront Riddick and company aboard the ship. Jack has important character development, as she discovers her violent side by shooting the ship's owner just before she can kill Riddick. This discovery is clearly a source of worry for Riddick and Imam as the three escape from the mercenary ship. Riddick decides to deliver both Jack and Imam to New Mecca, leaving them behind.
