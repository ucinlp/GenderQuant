Harry Dighby  and Walter Hill  are struggling vaudevillians who are sent to jail when Dighby is caught robbing audience members. They are assigned as roommates to a cultured, wealthy, and charming bank robber named Adam Worth . Worth plans to rob the Lowell Bank and Trust, both to avenge himself on the bank manager who had arranged his capture, and because his ego can not resist the temptation of robbing a bank reputed to be perfectly secure. Though in jail, he procures detailed diagrams of the bank's security systems. A reforming newspaperwoman named Lissa Chestnut  visits their cell, during which visit Dighby and Hill manage to photograph the bank plans with her camera, then burn the originals. They break out of prison the next day, as Worth is also paroled. They meet in New York and, by force, Worth manages to extract a copy of the photographed plans from them. Dighby, Hill, and Chestnut then band with Chestnut's team of do-gooders to race with Worth and his professional bank robbing squad to see who can first rob the Lowell Bank and Trust.
