Priya Malhotra  is an orphan who hopes to have a family of her own and keeps a diary outlining her dreams and the type of man she wants to meet â€“ someone who does not drink, smoke or tell lies. She is skeptical when her friend Honey's  aunt, a card reader, Sunita Rao , predicts that she will go to a foreign land and find the love of her life in seven days. She is pleasantly surprised when she is selected to go to a Youth Festival in Bangkok. That is where Immy  enters. Immy is a complete opposite to what Priya wants in a guy. He smokes, drinks, and lies all the time. Due to his bad habits, Immy is being chased by security and runs into Priya's hostel room. Before he leaves, he sees Priya and falls in love with her. He takes her diary and escapes. He then pretends to be the total guy Priya wants to be with, and the two start a relationship. Soon enough, Priya spots her diary in his room, and realizes he had stolen her diary and acted to be like her dream man. She breaks up with him, and leaves the country to go Delhi and forget about her past. After she reaches the airport, Immy also arrives, and explains to her that destiny wants them together. Priya does not believe him and therefore challenges him that if destiny did want them together, they would both find them again in future. In order to prove it, she asks Immy to write his name and phone number on a note and uses the same note to buy a Numerology book where she writes her own name and phone number and further she sells it in market at second hand rate. If she receives the same note again and if Immy finds that book with her name and number on it, then it will prove that they love each other and its destiny that wants them together. Three years later, Immy is engaged to Sofiya  and Priya is engaged to Jatin. However, a week before the marriage, both of them land up in Bangkok again looking for each other. They believe if they find each other one more time, they will prove their love to each other, however they are unable to find each other. Priya goes back to Delhi, and finds the currency note and realizes that destiny did actually want her and Immy together. When she calls him, his servant tells her he is going to his own wedding. Heartbroken Priya arrives at the wedding but is too late. She drops the note which had his number on, and runs away. She is crying to herself, until Immy shows up and says a child found the note and gave it to him, and he realized she had found him. Just like that, destiny helped him find her as well. The two express their love to each other, and get married.
