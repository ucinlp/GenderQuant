The map of fortune hunter Daffy Duck indicates that gold is located at precisely the spot where the Goofy Gophers live. When Mac and Tosh refuse to leave and defend their home, Daffy decides that violent means are needed to involuntarily remove what he considers pests. The Gophers fight back by giving Daffy first explosives, then ordinary rocks painted like gold, the latter of which fools Daffy into thinking he actually struck gold.
