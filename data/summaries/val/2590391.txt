Conrad Veidt plays Dr. Warren  who changes into Mr. O'Connor . This transformation is brought about, not by experimentation with chemicals as in Stevenson's original, but through the supernatural agency of a bust of Janus , which Warren / O'Connor purchases in the opening sequence as a gift for his sweetheart, Jane Lanyon . When she refuses the gift, horrified, Warren / O'Connor is forced to keep the statuette himself. It is at this point Dr. Warren first transforms into the gruesome character Mr. O'Connor, and returns to Jane's house in a rage, kidnapping her and taking her back to his laboratory. Upon recovery, Warren is horrified by what he has done and tries to sell the bust at auction, but the hold it has over him forces him to buy it back again. A second transformation proves to be his ruin, committing random acts of violence in the streets. Ultimately, Dr. Warren as Mr. O'Connor is forced to take poison after locking himself in his laboratory. He dies, clutching the statue to his chest.
