A group of New Jersey women, upset over their boyfriends' tendency to pay more attention to softball then their love lives, decide to beat them at their own game...literally. The girls form their own softball team and challenge the men to a match out on the field. The men initially scoff at the idea, but soon grow nervous when they worry that they'll lose face if they refuse to play.
