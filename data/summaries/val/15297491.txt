The story begins as Police Lt. Nick Ferrone explains what bail bonds-men do and tells the viewers the setting is Los Angeles, California. One such men is Vince Kane, a former cop. When one of his customers, Brackett, is murdered, Kane decides to investigate. He has two reasons for investigating: the curiosity of a former cop and it seems he has fallen in love with Brackett's widow Lucy, a woman he used to date.
