The story is set in 1897 in and around the small peaceful  farming village of Dolwyn in Mid-Wales. A massive dam and reservoir to supply water to Liverpool has been constructed at the head of the valley above Dolwyn, but construction has stopped due to geological difficulties; what was thought to be limestone is actually granite. Realising that a cheaper and easier scheme would involve the flooding of the village, Lord Lancashire, the scheme's promoter, dispatches an agent, Rob, to visit the village and buy the land. Rob persuades a reluctant, and debt-ridden, Lady Dolwyn to sell the land, and also offers the leaseholders large sums for their leases. They are also offered new houses in a Liverpool suburb and jobs in a cotton mill for those who want them. Rob has his own reasons for wanting the village flooded; he is a native of Dolwyn, but was stoned out of it twenty years before for thievery. He is thus hated by the villagers, whom he looks down on, and especially Gareth, the village shop owner, who helped to stone him. Whilst preparing to pack up and leave, Gareth, who has also lived in England and thus is more conversant with the language, discovers documents that prove his foster-Mother, Merri , to own her hand in perpetuity. A solicitor conforms this title. Lord Lancashire himself visits Merri, but soon realises that this simple village woman cannot be bought off or cajoled - and to top it all, she is able to cure his rheumatic shoulder with simple manipulation. He decides to leave the village alone and use the more expensive and difficult method of construction. Rob is furious and decides to sabotage the dam to flood the valley. He is unable to do so and instead decides to set fire to Merri's cottage. He is confronted by Gareth and a fight ensues. Rob is knocked down by Gareth and he falls into the fire he planned to use for his devilish work. He dies of a heart attack. Merri has witnessed the events and is horrified. Determined that the killing shall not be discovered, she herself makes her way to the dam's valve room and opens the valves. The villagers watch sadly from nearby safe ground as their beloved village is slowly drowned. A short prelude to the film shows a plaque near the dam marking the deaths of two people in the flood, but that only one of the bodies was recovered. The plaque not identify the two casualties of the flood, and the mystery of their identities is used in the film to add suspense, and, more importantly, in leading to the film's theme of moral ambiguity. The riddle is implicitly answered at the film's close; of the two bodies, one belongs to the villain of the story. Clearly, this is the body that was never found, for the village was flooded in order to conceal the manslaughter forever. The one found is the body of a shepherd whose voice has been, throughout the film, the voice of the beauty of the now-flooded valley, an innocent we last see alone in the village, sitting, singing on a wall while the rising flood waters lap at his booted feet. The film may be based on the construction of the Elan Valley Reservoirs, designed to supply water to Birmingham. Some filming was carried out at these dams.
