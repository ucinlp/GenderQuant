After 16 years absence from the Jensen Project, a secret community of geniuses conducting advanced underground to resolve the world's problems, Matt ([[Brady Smith  and Claire Thompson  are asked to come back and stop Edwin Jensen  from using nanobots to take over other people. To create these nanobots, Edwin needs a molecular assembler, which he steals. With the help of Kendrick James , Ginny  and Ingrid Jensen , Matt and Claire use chemical traces of gold and silicon to track down the location of the assembler. They are mislead, but their son, Brody , and his new friend from the Project, Samantha , manage to trace Edwin through a voice tracker and retrieve the molecular assembler. Brody is caught and implanted with nanobots. Edwin threatens to kill Brody with the nanobots if the molecular assembler is not returned to him. The Project members mount a successful mission to destroy Edwin's laboratory and capture Edwin before he can execute his plan to harm anyone with the nanobots.
