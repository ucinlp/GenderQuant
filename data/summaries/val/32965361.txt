On the islet Bannec, off the coast of Brittany, four fishermen have set up camp for three months to harvest seaweed. If processed correctly, the ash of the seaweed can be sold for high prices. It is therefore burnt in several large piles on the island. During a smaller brawl between the two youngest fishermen, Ambroise and Jean-Marie, Ambroise cuts his thumb on a piece of glass. After the brawl, Jean-Marie cannot find his knife and believes Ambroise has stolen it. At work next day Ambroise starts to feel weak. He discovers that the thumb is infected and swollen. He does not tell the others about it; instead, his attempts to hide the injury makes them accuse him of laziness and immature behaviour. After a feverish night, Ambroise decides to sneak out and sail to Ushant to see a doctor, but the voyage fails due to low wind and a strong current. On his way back to the camp, Ambroise collapses on the beach. On Ushant, people are concerned that only one pile of smoke is coming from Bannec. A disquieted group of people go to the island doctor and ask him to go to the islet, which he promises to do as soon as the tide allows. Meanwhile the other men on Bannec discover Ambroise on the beach and carry him to the camp. Jean-Marie suddenly finds his knife and realises he has judges Ambroise unfairly. He tries to convince the other men to bring Ambroise to Ushant, but is told that it is impossible without more wind. Jean-Marie then carries Ambroise to the boat. Struggling both with the boat and to keep Ambroise conscious, he sets out to get him to the doctor himself. At the same time, the doctor has enlisted a crew of volunteers and sets out to reach Bannec. A thick fog appears and both boats have a hard time to see anything. Eventually, as they pass close to each other, Jean-Marie sees the doctor's boat and calls for it. The doctor hears the call. He boards Jean-Marie's boat and quickly lances Ambroise's thumb. Ambroise is brought ashore on Ushant. He is put to bed. Jean-Marie visits him and tends him. The tired doctor receives a message about a sick man on the other side of the island and sets off.
