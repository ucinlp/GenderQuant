Bugs wakes up after a long night to find that a burly construction worker  has just shoveled up his rabbit hole near a highrise building being built. Bugs kindly asks the construction worker to put his hole back, but the worker simply dumps Bugs and the dirt into a dump truck. Bugs angrily shouts "Hey, you big gorilla! Haven't you ever heard of the sanctity of the American home?" before another mound of earth falls on him and the truck hauls him away. But a when the worker exits the crane, Bugs calls him from the building under construction  dropping a brick on him , then a steel girder, and then plays with the elevator controls while the worker is inside the elevator. Bugs then impersonates the project engineer and orders the worker to make a high brick wall. Next, Bugs traps the worker on a teeterboard, removing bricks one by one, causing it to tip forward. The worker, desperate not to fall, strips down to his underwear. Ultimately, the worker falls in the end. However, the worker manages to get the better of Bugs, knocking him out temporarily with a steel girder and causing Bugs to dumbly "sleepwalk" through a harrowing series of moving girders and other objects, finally regaining his senses when he falls into a barrel full of water. When Bugs recovers and sees the worker taking the lunch of a shy worker for himself and sending the hapless man back to work, this infuriates Bugs. Bugs takes a look at the floor plans for the building, then drops a single red-hot rivet down a hole, which bounces around through an elaborate maze of objects, until it burns through a rope holding up a giant steel pipe. The pipe then falls on top of the worker . The worker finally waves the white flag in defeat. The next shot is of the finished skyscraper, with a slight indentation in the middle. At the bottom, Bugs sits in his hole - the building has been built around it - and declares: "After all, a man's home is his castle."
