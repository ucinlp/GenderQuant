B.N. Reddi is one of the most prolific filmmakers of Telugu cinema during the 1950s. He is also the director of the critically acclaimed Malleswari. The plot is an adaptation of Shakespeare's Hamlet with significant changes. Plot lines like the queen marrying the king's murderer, tragic ending are removed. Instead, in the film, after the king's murder by his prime minister, the queen and the prince form a team. Prince feigns madness as in the play but the conclusion was changed to a happy ending.
