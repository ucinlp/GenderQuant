Owen, a young reporter for a Los Angeles-based music magazine, goes back to his Florida hometown to interview Sherry, a local rock singer. Sherry and her band are becoming increasingly popular, largely because of a song she wrote about being sexually assaulted as a girl; this song has become a hit on college radio. Owen's reasons for returning to his hometown are more than professional, however: he and Sherry were close friends in childhood. Through flashbacks, the movie recalls Owen's memory of a critical moment in that past. In the end, Owen informs his brother Dan that he sent the details of the crime committed to Dan's parole officer and also to his editor. In addition, he also describes his own role in the crime - he participated in a gang-rape he was unable to prevent. Owen is able find some of the twelve girls who were raped and convinces them to testify against Dan. When Dan vehemently asks why Owen is doing this, Owen replies that he once loved Sherry.
