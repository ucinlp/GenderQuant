Bugs Bunny is drumming up business for a vaudeville show in a remote western town . One of the main attractions is 'Fearless Freep' and his high-dive act. As soon as Yosemite Sam hears the name 'Fearless Freep', he goes into a frenzy, buying as many tickets as he can.  During the show, as Bugs is about to introduce Freep, he gets a telegram informing him that Freep is delayed by a storm and won't be able to appear until the next day. An angered Sam insists on seeing the high-diving act and forces Bugs at gunpoint to the top of a high-dive platform. But Bugs manages to pull out all his tricks and stops, and it is Sam who does all the diving, in a different comical setting nine separate times . 1: Sam pushes Bugs to the edge of the platform . Bugs dupes Sam into covering his eyes while he puts on his bathing suit, and then proceeds to spin the board around so that Sam is at the diving edge. Bugs makes it look like he's taken the dive , but Sam turns around and starts to walk off, right off the edge and into the tank, which falls apart with the water still intact. 2: Bugs springs on the board so hard that he sends Sam up, over and down . Bugs then realizes that he forgot to fill the tank with water, so he grabs a bucket of water from off-camera and throws it down from the diving board past Sam. The water makes it into the tank, but Sam misses the tank altogether, smashing through the stage into the basement. 3: Sam walks to the end of the board and finds Bugs standing under the board upside-down . But it is Sam who is upside-down . Sam looks "up", then sees the tank, and falls "up" into it. 4: Having been verbally hit with "fightin' words", Bugs dares Sam to "step over this line" , sending Sam down for the splash again  5: Sam is stopped by a door, and yells "Open up that door!" then turns to the audience and says: "You notice I didn't say Richard?". He backs up and charges towards the door, which Bugs opens at the last microsecond, leading Sam to another splash, this time assisted by an anvil which Bugs gives him. 6: Bugs, dressed as an Indian, points Sam to a "short-cut" in a desert-like setting . Sam thanks the "Indian" and takes the route leading to yet another dive. After two more dives in which the setups are unseen, Sam finally has Bugs tied and standing on the edge of the platform, with Sam sawing away at the board, gloating: "Now ya smarty-pants, let's see ya get out-in this one! This time, you're a-diving!" However, as soon as Sam cuts through the board, it's the ladder and platform that falls, leaving the cut plank suspended in mid-air. Bugs turns to the camera and cracks: "I know this defies the law of gravity, but, you see, I never studied law!" High Diving Hare can be seen in the third act of The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie.
