In 1999, ten years have passed since the fifth film; Freddy Krueger had failed to attack Alice Johnson  and her son Jacob as they have moved away from Springwood, and it states that through a series of mysterious suicides and murders every child in Springwood, Ohio has died. It indicates there is evidence of another teenager; the film opens with the teenager on an airplane, but he falls through the plane before it can leave Springwood and after he escapes his house, which is directly across from 1428 Elm Street, he tries to flee on foot. Freddy tracks him down and ejects the boy from Springwood by sending him through the border. As Freddy cannot cross the city line, the opening seals itself when Freddy touches it. He tells him to be a "good little doggy, and go fetch!" Waking without his memories of who he is or where he comes from, the teenager is eventually picked up by police and taken to a youth shelter, given the name John Doe by Maggie Burroughs, who becomes his care giver. Her other charges are introduced, Carlos, who was abused by his family, ending up with a hearing impairment, Tracy, a tough and angry girl who was raped in her youth by her father, and Spencer, whose rich lifestyle and overbearing father had driven him to drugs. Doc, a therapist at the shelter specializing in dream therapy suggests that Maggie try to help John discover who he is and that might help her with her own recurring nightmares of a little girl and a woman being murdered. John begins having strange nightmares of the same little girl and of his "memory" trying to get him to free it. A newspaper clipping about a missing woman he brought makes Maggie suggest they go to Springwood to find his past. They take the van, but John has a hallucination of the little girl telling him to "go back" and the panic reveals that Tracy, Carlos and Spencer also stowed away in the van hoping to escape the shelter. They arrive in Springwood where the adult population for the greater part has lost their minds and are both fearful and coveting of the new children who have come to town. Unable to contact the shelter, Maggie sends the three teens back while she and John decide to investigate the school. However, an unseen force keeps sending them in circles and they are unable to leave Springwood. They eventually walk down an abandoned street and break into a house, which quickly changes its exterior to reveal that it's 1428 Elm Street, Freddy's old house. Maggie and John go to the high school, where they learn that the town's psychosis was caused from the deaths of every child in Springwood. They find a memoir of the original child victims of Freddy, as well as where the newsletter clipping came from. They also learn Freddy had a child that was taken away when he was arrested. They go to the orphanage where the matron is playing "Skip to my Lieu" with imaginary children. She recognizes John and Maggie, causing John to believe he is Freddy's son but Maggie finds this lead unreliable Unable to get any new clues, except that Freddy's child's first initial was 'K', they leave. Meanwhile, Carlos falls asleep and encounters Freddy who magnifies his hearing aid, then uses his claws on a chalkboard to make Carlos' head explode from the noise, in reality his body vanishes and Tracy leaves the house while Spencer lays stoned in front of the television which is working for him, but is just a worn out piece of junk to Tracy. She gathers Maggie and John, and they return, but not before Spencer is pulled into a video game where images of his father and Freddy are the antagonists. His body zooming around the house like he's in a video game. Tracy and John enter the nightmare to save him, but they are too late when Freddy knocks Spencer into a pit that Maggie witnesses. She is able to wake Tracy, but John is too far gone and they try to escape, however in John's dream he is in a parachute and Freddy appears. Freddy says John is not his child and destroys the parachute making John fall on bed-spikes killing him, revealing his child was a girl, which he relays to Maggie in his dying breath. Freddy absorbs John's soul and enters Maggie's mind, now able to travel where she goes. At the shelter, no one remembers Spencer, John or Carlos including Maggie's boss. But Doc is able to remember them because he can control his dreams and is free of Freddy's influence. Maggie remembers what John said and finds out that she had been adopted. She has another dream in which she witnesses Freddy Krueger kill his wife in front of Maggie's eyes. Freddy reveals her name is Katherine Krueger and that she told the authorities he killed her mother resulting in her being put up for adoption. Freddy reveals the true purpose for his killing spree: to get revenge against the people who took his daughter away from him by killing their children. But now that they're all dead he can start over, because "Every town has an Elm Street!" showing the shelter as his intended "playground." Before waking her from the dream. Meanwhile Tracy is attacked by a nightmare of her father who becomes Freddy and she is able to wake herself by burning her wrists over the stove. They go to Doc, who was also attacked by Freddy. He discovers that he could bring a piece of Freddy's shirt out of the nightmare and that would be how they kill him. Maggie enters a dream state and puts on a pair of 3-D glasses that serve as the climax of the film to the audience in the 3D version of the film. She steps into Freddy's past, revealing his conception and childhood which he displayed the signs of psychosis, killing small animals and being taunted by children.
