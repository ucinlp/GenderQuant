The Valley is about four prospectors who walk into a valley and unwittingly enter a rift in the time/space continuum. As they journey down the valley, one of the prospectors  gets taken away by a Harpy. Another prospector  falls off a cliff. The two remaining  have to fight and destroy a Cyclops. They build a raft, float across a lake and see a building in ruins. This ruin, unbeknownst to them, is the Beehive building of Wellington city â€“ they haven't travelled back in time but ahead into a Post-Apocalyptic world taken over by mythical beasts.
