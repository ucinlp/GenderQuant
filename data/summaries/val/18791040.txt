Two cops - Sean  and his partner Billie  are on the front line in the city's never ending war on crime. In addition to the routine small-time robberies they're dealing with on a daily basis, they must face a very dangerous and powerful man called Dalton Rhodes , who's not only a smuggler of guns and stolen luxury cars, but also a master of martial arts. Police are finding one body after another of mafia related people . Sean and Billie have only vague clues in this case and no idea who's actually behind those murders. An aid in solving the riddle is to come from Sean's troubled younger brother Michael, who's found himself working for the mob boss Rhodes. Soon he'll learn that an easy way to get rich is also extremely dangerous and sometimes lethal.
