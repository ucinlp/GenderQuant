For the Cause is set in the future on a distant planet that has two human colonies. They were founded as a refuge from the wars of Earth, but the vision died when the colonies began fighting a hundred-year war, reducing their once mighty cities to rubble. The stone walled city of Brecca is the northern neighbor of the nation of Obsidian, a culture of black glass cities and unfathomable technology. The war drags on with the vestiges of once mighty technologies, and the great armies are now but orphaned teenagers, fighting and dying for a cause they never knew. Unless the war ends, yet another entire generation of children on both sides will perish in battle, so Brecca’s greatest military leader, General Murren , decides to use the last of Brecca’s ancient weapons to end the war. It is called Warhammer, a hundred-year-old weapon built to cripple Obsidian’s technology using a technology more like magic than science. Murren leads a small team to deliver the weapon to Obsidian, taking with him his most loyal soldier, Sutherland  and Abel , a beautiful woman who is the last master of the ancient weapon. Feared by even her own people, Abel uses her ancient skills to channel energy into lethal forms. Murren also selects Evans , a celebrated warrior with a mysterious past, who has learned that peace is greater than victory. The small team intends to penetrate the defenses of an enemy city that couldn't be reached by Murren's father and six million men, but as the team battles its way toward Obsidian, they also must contend with their own Breccan people, torn apart by a century of conflict.
