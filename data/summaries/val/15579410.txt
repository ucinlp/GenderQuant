Tula, a thirty one year old unmarried woman, whose sister has just died, decides to bring her brother in law, a bank employee and his two children into her home. As she takes over the management of their lives, she gradually usurps the privileges of her brother in law, and his children. She acts as a wife mother figure, but does not accept the sexual commitments or maternal responsibilities of her new role. Ramiro, her brother in law, is attracted to Tula as she dotes on his children, but she spurns his affections. She is also critical of his interest in other women. As Ramiros’ sexual frustration grows, he attempts to rape Tula. Tula’s priest advises her to marry Ramiro. When she is ready to agree, she discovers that Ramiro is paying court to another woman, Tula’s nubile teenage cousin, Juanita and obtaining sexual favors elsewhere. Juanita becomes pregnant and Ramiro is forced to marry her, taking his children and new wife to a life, out of the provinces and into the city. The closing scene shows Tula waving goodbye to the ménage as the train departs, resigned to her spinster status.
