The business does well and everything works in an orderly fashion until one day an itinerant painter is hired to decorate the doors and vases at the factory for Chinese New Year. The woman, forbidden to marry as it would involve outsiders in the factory ownership, is drawn to the headstrong painter. When they fall in love, the situation throws her entire life into disarray.
