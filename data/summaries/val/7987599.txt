Ted Healy is a producer trying to stage an elaborate musical revue. His efforts are constantly interrupted by demanding back stage personalities: a flaky musician , a less-than-cooperative girl friend , and a trio of raucous friends . Ted is able to get the show ready for presentation, but during the main number the Three Stooges slip beneath the enormous hoopskirt costume worn by the leading vocalist. They emerge on stage during the performance, ruining the show.Lenburg, Jeff, Maurer, Joan Howard, and Lenburg, Greg, "The Three Stooges Scrapbook." Page 226. Citadel Press. ISBN 0-8065-0946-5]
