After an argument with her husband, Lucy Church storms out of her house and goes to see a film at the local cinema. While looking for the toilet she stumbles across the office where she witnesses the murder of the cinema manager by two criminals Wade and Barney who are in the process of robbing the cinema's safe. When they pursue her, she is struck by a bus and is taken to hospital. Unable to leave the town until they know what has happened to her, the two robbers head to the hospital to observe her. Meanwhile her husband Jay Church has grown concerned and scours the town searching for her. At the hospital the medical staff attend to Lucy and place her in a quiet ward although she has yet to regain coconsciousness. Ward, watching from the nearby shrubbery realises that if she lives she would be able to identify him and he would be hanged for murder and he decides to murder her in spite of the protests of his partner, Barney who has grown disillusioned with his sinister intent. Wade is uninterested and beats him. He tries to enter the hospital several times to strangle her, but is foiled by the watchfulness of an elderly patient. Eventually, Ward is forced to assume the disguise of a hospital orderly and takes Lucy to the operating theatre where he plans to murder her - only to be prevented by the sudden reappearance of Barney, his associate.
