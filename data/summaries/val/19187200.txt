The film begins with the following lines appearing on screen, complete with deliberate spelling mistakes: "Attention! Ce flim n'est pas un flim sur le cyclimse. Merci de votre compr√©hension."  The story begins with the death of George Abitbol , described as the classiest man in the world, somewhere near the fictitious atoll of Pom Pom Galli in the South Pacific. Reporters Dave , Peter  and Steven  investigate his death by going to meet people who knew him during his life in Texas. They mostly investigate his last words: this movie is a parody of Citizen Kane. Pom Pom Galli was taken from the Wayne movie The Sea Chase.
