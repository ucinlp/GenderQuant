The film begins with a tank battle where blond-haired Captain Holland  is sprawled unconscious in the dunes. When he comes to, he walks over the dunes until collapsing near a Bedouin encampment at an oasis. He is found by the sheik's daughter, Mabrouka , who takes him to the camp which consists of several black tents. The film skips forward to a point after the war when Captain Holland's brother, Colonel Sir Charles Holland , is guided into the desert by Ali  in search of his brother. They were drawn by a promissory note that had been given by Captain Holland to Bedouins for their assistance and eventually cashed. Sir Charles eventually comes across the Bedouin camp and is entertained by the camp's chief, Sheik Salem ben Yussef  and sees a young blond boy in the camp. Later, the Sheik becomes angry at Sir Charles's line of questioning about his brother, the boy, and note and asks them to leave. Before they leave, Mabrouka gives Ali a sock containing Captain Holland's diary which Ali then gives Sir Charles. The film skips back in time to recount the story within the diary. Captain Holland, having been tended by Mabrouka, recovers. He learns that Mabrouka is the daughter of the sheik and is betrothed to Sheik Faris  from another tribe. When a German reconnaissance vehicle is spotted, Captain Holland hides in some Roman ruins. The senior German officer then finds Holland's service revolver in a tent. Mabrouka and Captain Holland become romantically involved to the obvious annoyance of Sheik Faris. He colludes with the Germans who return to the camp where Holland kills them and Faris. The romance between Captain Holland and Mabrouka deepens and they marry. Learning of the British victory at El Alamein, Captain Holland seeks to return to the British lines but finds out his wife is now pregnant. A group led by the Sheik and Captain Holland travel towards the British lines but came across a column of retreating Italian vehicles. Captain Holland sustains a fatal injury rescuing the Sheik. The film returns to the present day with the Sheik handing Sir Charles a letter with his brother's will bequeathing his estate to his son. Sir Charles discusses this with his nephew but the boy decides to remain with the tribe and burns the letter.
