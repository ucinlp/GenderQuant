They're always trying to prove to each other that one is better than the other and are always bickering. When Pandiyan insults his daughter's suitor who comes to see her in hopes of finding a future bride. Pandiyan insults him for not having as much money as he did and questioned his mother if she had other husbands. Hearing this Livingston's father gets a heart attack. In anger Livingstone, wanting to make Pandiyan lose his properties and come to the streets, arranges to have a petty thief Paramu  pose as a rich man and wriggle his way in as Pandiyan's son-in-law. Paramu and another thief Sivam are always competing against each other to be better than the other and to become a millionaire before the other. This leads to a lot of comic rivalries. But Paramu mistakenly enters Cheran's house because the gate of Pandiyan's house had been recently been painted over and Manju falls for him. Meanwhile, Sivam ,Paramu's friend, enters Pandiyan's house posing as a cinema director. Madhavan  helps them both since he is in love with a poor girl and is pretty sure that his father will oppose his wedding. Paramu and Sivam make a deal with Abbas that if he helps them become rich then Paramu would adopt the poor girl that Abbas loves so they would be equal in prestige and stature. This way Abbas's rich father would agree to their marriage. Paramu and Sivam pose as the sons of Abbas's dad. How everything comes to be known to both families and Abbas's family forms the crux of the story.
