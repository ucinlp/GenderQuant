Sao is a nurse who comes to work at an older, rundown hospital in Bangkok. Witnessing her arrival is Num, a disabled orderly. Num is shy, but a little girl selling roses convinces him to buy one. He gives her money and the girl in turn gives the rose to Sao, forming a bond between the two. Sao takes room in an old house behind the hospital, near a disused gymnasium and the old morgue. She is getting over a breakup with an old boyfriend who left her because she turns into a ghost. And, indeed, unbeknownst to her, she does turn into the krasue ghost that very night, scaring the hospital's security guard.
