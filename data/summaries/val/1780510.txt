Greg Nolan  is a newspaper photographer who lives a lavish and carefree life--that is, until he encounters an estranged, lovelorn woman named Bernice  on the beach near her beach front home. She assumes different names and personalities whenever the mood hits her . After having her dog, Albert, a Great Dane , chase Greg into the water when he insults her after not feeling anything towards her after they kissed; she invites him to stay at her home and later manages to make him lose his job and apartment after drugging him, which left him in a deep sleep for days. However, Bernice manages to find Greg another home, and he wants to pay her back. So he gets two full-time photographer jobs: one for a Playboy-like magazine company owned by Mike Lansdown , and the other for a very conservative advertising firm co-owned  by Mr. Penlow . The two jobs are in the same building, forcing Greg to run from one job to the other without being detected. Greg now has to manage balancing the two conflicting jobs along with dealing with Bernice and her eccentric ways.
