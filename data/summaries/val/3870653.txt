In the year 1960, a plague known as "male-itis" has killed every fertile man on Earth over the age of 12. Boys under the age of 12 have been vaccinated, but they are all rendered sterile. Womankind takes over the world and a woman becomes President of the United States. Meanwhile, a female aviator, Gertie , flying over the Ozarks finds smoke rising from the chimney of a cabin. She discovers a reclusive hillbilly named Elmer Smith  living there with his sweetheart Hattie . He is captured and examined at a hospital. All the women in the world soon begin to fight over Smith. This film emphasized two events still very memorable at the time: the 1918 influenza epidemic, and women winning the right to vote in 1920.
