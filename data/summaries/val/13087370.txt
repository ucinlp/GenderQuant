Mark Sway and his little brother, Ricky, are sneaking cigarettes in the forest near their home when they witness the suicide of mob lawyer Jerome Clifford. Prior to his suicide, Clifford reveals to Mark that he is killing himself to avoid being murdered by Barry "The Blade" Muldanno, the nephew of notorious mob kingpin "Uncle Johnny Sulari". As a result of witnessing the suicide, Ricky goes in to shock and is hospitalized. It soon becomes apparent to authorities - and the mob - that Clifford may have revealed to Mark the location of the body of a Louisiana senator believed to have been murdered by Muldanno. Mark seeks out a lawyer, and finds Reggie Love , a recovering alcoholic who agrees to defend him in court. They quickly run afoul of Roy Foltrigg , a celebrated and vain U.S. Attorney, who is attempting to solve the case as a springboard to greater ambitions. In the mean time, it is revealed that Sulari never authorized Muldanno to make the hit on the senator, and is requiring Muldanno to try and figure out how much the kids may know about the location of the body. Muldanno is also required to move the body, but isn't able to immediately because he had buried it in Clifford's boathouse, and the cops are still on the property investigating his suicide. As all parties become increasingly desperate, Foltrigg tries to go to continued legal lengths to get the location of the body through Mark's testimony, while Sulari eventually orders Muldanno to kill the children and their lawyer to avoid any further screw-ups in trying to deal with the case. He also orders the body moved, now that the investigation at Clifford's home is over. Mark and Reggie go to New Orleans to confirm that the body is still where he was told it is, knowing that it is their only bargaining chip to get Ricky the help he needs, and to place the family in protective custody. They arrive the same night as Muldanno and his fellow mafia goons, who begin digging up the body but who are stopped by Mark and Reggie. In the melee that follows, the mafia goons flee when the neighbor's alarm is tripped and the authorities are summoned. Knowing that the body is there, Reggie is able to use the information as a bargaining chip to get the family the full slate of protective custody and medical help for Ricky, as well as a new home and job for the children's mother. Although not explicitly stated, it becomes apparent that Sulari has had enough of Muldanno and is going to have his nephew killed. With the body recovered, Foltrigg is a lock-in for the newspaper headlines he craves, and makes mention that he intends to run for governor.
