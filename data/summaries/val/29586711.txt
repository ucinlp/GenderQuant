In Hawaii, during World War II, U.S. Navy pilot Alec Brooke  successfully commands a flying boat, named the "High Barbaree". During a bombing mission against a Japanese submarine, his PBY Catalina is shot down with all but one of his crew killed, but still able to stay afloat, adrift far from Allied territory. While the crippled aircraft is slowly floating, the two survivors hear the voice of "Tokyo Rose"  invoking memories of their past. Alec shares a series of recollections with fellow survivor, Lt. Joe Moore ([[Cameron Mitchell . His memories concern his boyhood sweetheart, Nancy Fraser , now a Navy nurse serving on a ship in the Pacific theater, commanded by his uncle, Capt. Thad Vail ([[Thomas Mitchell . His uncle had once discovered High Barbaree, a mythical island that the crew members now head for, using a lashed-up sail made from parachutes to convert the flying boat into a sailboat, but as water supplies dwindle and both men begin to succumb to the conditions, Alec continues his story of a childhood where he had dreamed of becoming a doctor like his father . After completing the first two years of medical training, he had chosen to become a pilot and rose to the ranks of vice-president of the Case Aviation company, even winning the hand of the boss's daughter .

The coming of war precludes Alec continuing his medical career, and as a pilot in the highly-specialized PBY flying boats that harass the Japanese fleets, he is particularly successful until his last mission. After Joe dies, and Alec goes into a coma, High Barbaree seems only a dream when rescue comes at the last moment, as his uncle steers to the location he had once charted and finds Alec. On board, Nancy and the recovering Alec are finally reunited.
