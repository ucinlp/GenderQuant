An unidentified flying object makes an emergency landing on Earth and is taken into custody by the United States government. The occupant of the "flying saucer" turns out to be a cat-like alien named Zunar-J-5/9 Doric-4-7, or Jake  as he is called by his human friends (a tawny [[Abyssinian . When the Army takes his space ship into custody, without any sign of 'the pilot', which could be a 'slimey, green-headed, twelve-legged creep', Jake realizes that he needs help to not only get his ship back, but repair it as well, since the Mother Ship cannot send one in time. Tracking the military to the Energy Research Laboratory  Jake uses his special collar to spy on the top energy specialists in the country, hoping to find an ally. But while none of them possesses the knowledge that Jake needs, a theoretical scientist named Dr. Frank Wilson  comes along and explains that the propulsion unit from Jake's ship, which the military has brought to E.R.L. because they want to know what makes it tick, is tapping the Primal Mainstream. More commonly referred to as electromagnetic energy pulled in from the universe itself, Frank is rebuffed in his claims due to his odd sense of humor. Jake follows Frank to his office in the bottom floor of the E.R.L. building, where Frank nicknames him Jake. Before Jake can communicate with Frank his intentions, Dr. Liz Bartlet , who heads the Thermal Department, storms into his office, upset at Franks sense of humor in light of such an important scientific discovery. Frank is able to calm her down, mostly by introducing Jake, and asks her out to dinner. Liz accepts and leaves the small office. Once she has gone, Jake reveals his true nature to Frank, demonstrating his incredible powers of mental-communication and levitation thanks to the special collar around his neck. He eventually manages to convince Frank to help him, by offering him a quantum-leap in his own research on energy. After helping Dr. Norman Link, a garbage researcher at E.R.L., win a basketball game  and dodging Liz and her cat Lucybelle by Jake faking a cold, the pair break into Hopscotch Air Base, where Jake's ship is being kept, and after freezing a guard dog and a soldier to get by, make it into the hangar to commence repairs. Using a back-up collar, Frank is able to fly around the hangar and eventually up to the top of the ship where he plants a special intercog device that helps Jake find out the problem. Realizing one of the catalizers has burnt out, Jake needs an element called "Org 12" in order to be able to fly once again. However, Frank doesn't know what "Org 12" is, and when Jake's computer identifies its atomic weight as 196.967, Frank realizes that "Org 12" on Earth is actually Gold. The pair barely escape from Hopscotch base alive when a passing security guard finds the frozen soldier and dog and hits the alarm, and after Jake levitates Frank and a stolen motorcycle over the locked fence, the pair get back to Frank's apartment. There, Frank tells Jake that, based on Jake's calculations, they will need $120,000 dollars in order to buy the necessary gold to repair Jake's ship. Which is money that Frank doesn't have. The answer comes to them when Link comes over to watch horse races and football games, that he had placed major bets on. Realizing that they can use this to win the money they need, Jakes uses his powers help Link's horse, called Sweet Jake, win the derby. Jake and Frank use this to convince Link to help them, but have to convince Link to help them willingly. After a series of levitation tricks, Link agrees to help them. But when Jake gets knocked out by a well-meaning vet in the second football game, brought in by Dr. Bartlet because she thought Jake was still sick, the pair pull Liz along to Ernest Ernies Pool Hall, where Link has called in his bets. Desperate to get even when they find out the last football game has been lost, they are tricked into a game of pool with a hustler named Sarasota Slim. At first Frank's attempts to use Jake's collar to win go awry, nearly killing a couple of people by sending pool balls flying all over the room, Jake wakes up thanks to an onion-heavy sandwich from one of the spectators. Convincing Ernie to give them one last shot, Jake manipulates the game in order to enable Liz to win the $120,000 they need to acquire the gold for Jake's ship. However, all this time, a man named Stallwood, , has been watching Frank and Jake. Working as a spy at E.R.L., Stallwood first became aware of this when he say Frank and Jake break into Hopscotch. Worse, Stallwood works for a master criminal named Olympus, who is after the secret of Jake's collar for the purposes of universal domination. To make matters worse, the military are also on to Frank and Jake, and go to arrest them for the sake of National Security. Frank and Jake manage to elude the military and the criminals, only to have Link and Liz  captured by Olympus and his men. They plan to ransom them back for the collar, which forces Jake to make a desperate decision. Jake sends his ship back to the awaiting Mother Ship, which will not return for another 115 years, and stays on Earth in order to help rescue his friends. In the end, Jake and Frank use a broken-down biplane to rescue Liz and Lucybelle from Olympus's helicopter, and Jake is allowed to stay as a representative of a 'friendly power'. He then applies for citizenship in the United States, with Frank as his sponsor, using his powers to levitate the judge who is swearing him in.
