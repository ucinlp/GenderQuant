The story involves the Tucks, a family who drank from a magic spring from the Fosters' little forest and became immortal . In the novel, set in the late 19th century, the protagonist is ten-year-old Winifred Foster. She comes from a well-bred, straight-laced family and becomes lost in the woods one day during an attempt to escape her smothered lifestyle. In the woods, she encounters Jesse Tuck, a boy of immortals due to a spring from which he and his family drank water years ago. The novel ultimately puts up an argument for mortality and why it is necessary by using the Tucks as an example.
