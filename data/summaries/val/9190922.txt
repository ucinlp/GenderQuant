Bates moves back into town and begins a friendship with Hagen's favorite teacher Julia Kane . There are hints that Bates is the real father of Hagen, though it is later revealed that she is an orphan adopted by the Hagens. When the teacher leaves town, she suggests to Bates that he stop playing Hagan's father, as it has become clear that he is in love with her. The movie ends with Bates and Hagen boarding a train, presumably to get married.
