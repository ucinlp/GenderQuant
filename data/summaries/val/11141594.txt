Kamal Haasan plays the younger son of an illustrious Carnatic music maestro. The role of the father is played by legendary thespian Gemini Ganesan. The father is a strict disciplinarian who is very class conscious and cares only for his art. The maestro's eldest son was born mute and hence had to take to an instrument, the nadhaswaram, which he is quite adept at. The father looks upon his younger son to carry on his artistic legacy in vocal music. Kamal Haasan's character on the contrary has limited interest in classical music and is more interested in social services. This causes a rift between son and father. The film depicts how the son gains fame through serving the people and ultimately winning his father's respect.
