Steve Clark  is on a Los Angeles-bound bus and gets off in a small town on the way. He first hides a large amount of cash he had been carrying in his suitcase. Then he gets a job, which leads him to a chance encounter with Julie Saunders , a local woman in her 20s. Julie lives with an elderly, bitter aunt who makes her life miserable. Clark, with his charm and original outlook on life, instantly becomes a ray of sunlight for her, and they quickly marry. However, Clark soon admits to her that the marriage is part of a plan he has crafted. This plan will help him launder a large amount of ill-gotten cash--but it also involves murder and will make Julie an accessory to it, against her will.
