Although to the outside world he seems like the a perfectly normal insurance broker, Michael secretly keeps a 10-year-old boy called Wolfgang locked in a room in his soundproof basement. The film shows Michael washing his genitals after leaving Wolfgang's room, thus more or less confirming to the viewer that he has sex with him. Apart from that they have somewhat of a father–son relationship, with Michael sometimes being strict, sometimes caring, and sometimes playful. In the evenings, after Michael locks the door and closes the blinds, Wolfgang is allowed into the living room for dinner and to watch TV. When in hospital after an accident, Michael is in a hurry to be released and return to Wolfgang. When Wolfgang gets sick Michael digs a grave in the woods, as a preparation in case Wolfgang dies. However, he recovers. The boy writes a letter to his parents, to be mailed by Michael, but Michael does not send it and lies to Wolfgang saying his parents don’t want him back. Sometimes he takes the boy on a pleasure trip outside the town, where people do not know Michael. On one occasion he goes on a skiing trip with friends for multiple days, leaving extra food for Wolfgang, who has water, a toilet, simple cooking facilities and a TV in his room. Since Wolfgang is lonely, Michael promises that another child will arrive, so that he has company. Together they assemble a bunk bed in advance. Michael attempts to abduct another boy by luring him away , but the boy is called back by his father, who scolds him for walking off with a stranger. Michael tells Wolfgang that he did not succeed in providing him a friend to keep him company. One day Wolfgang throws boiling water into Michael's face, severely hurting his eyes, but Wolfgang does not succeed in escaping. Michael drives off but dies in an accident. After the funeral Michael's mother is about to discover the boy when the film ends.
