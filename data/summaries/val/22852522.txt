The Loneliest Runner follows the story of Michael Landon's alter-ego, 13 year-old John Curtis , who still wets his bed although already into his teens. The problem is publicized, by his mother, Alice Curtis , not only at home but also in public. She even goes so far as to hang her sonâ€™s stained bed sheets up in the window for all to see. For fear of having his friends see the yellow sheets, the embarrassed John runs home from school every day and takes them down to avoid further humiliation. Soon, however, the running becomes more than a race home but an ambition. Partly because he loves it, and also to help him forget his shame and hurt of his unhappy home life, John starts running with the Junior track team in order to channel his anger. The show continues on ten years later when the now adult John Curtis  is an Olympic marathon runner and a gold-medal-winner. During a post-race interview, the adult Curtis gives credit to his mother for his success as a runner.
