The film opens on Mars, showing the last moments of a Mars rover's mission. As the rover prepares to sample Martian rock, it "kicks the bucket." The mission controllers congratulate themselves on a "successful" mission, while back on Mars the scene pans up from the dead rover to show a huge undiscovered Martian city. A spaceship is seen quickly rocketing from the city and accelerating into space. News producer Tim O'Hara , is fired for unwillingly "compromising" his boss's daughter, Brace Channing , during a live broadcast of the first Space Shuttle launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base. His assistant, the shy Lizzie , tries to comfort him, and it's apparent she has a secret crush on him. A while later, Tim witnesses a small Martian spacecraft crash landing. Realizing his chance to deliver a story that will "rock the Earth", he brings Brace to show her the ship. Nearby, its only occupant  hides in the bushes. Tim takes the now-shrunken spaceship home with him with the Martian following him to retrieve it. After Tim knocks the Martian out, the Martian's suit, named Zoot, comes alive and knocks Tim out; the Martian quickly comes to and disguises himself to look like Tim and ends up kissing Lizzie when she visits. When Tim confronts the Martian the next morning, he finds out the "electron accelerator," a small device which powers the control systems of the ship, is damaged beyond repair and the Martian needs Tim's help to find a replacement. Eventually, the Martian takes the name "Uncle Martin" and explores the city, unaware that they are being watched by SETI, which discovered DNA left by Martin while hiding out at Tim's. While exploring Tim's neighborhood, Martin tells him about a friend of his named "Neenert," one of his planet's most gifted Martian scientists, who came to Earth in 1964. Tim and Martin also stop by at a beach wear shop and Martin buys a new pair of clothes, leaving a jealous Zoot in the fitting room but then escapes out. Tim's other friends including Lizzie meet Martin without knowing that he really is a Martian yet; after this, Brace is captured by the SETI gang as she is mistaken by them as an alien. As the story continues, Tim secretly tapes Martin and Zoot with hidden cameras to back up his story and impress the TV station staff, but he eventually decides not to, considering his friendship with Martin. Meanwhile, Martin and Zoot discover a subsystem called the Interstellar Safety System which is prepared to self-destruct, taking Martin's ship with it. Lizzie shows up at Tim's house, to discover Brace stealing the tape. After thinking that Tim cheated on her, Lizzie rejects him and storms out, only to be distracted by the now full size spaceship and is pulled into the cockpit by Zoot. A screenshot of Martin in the bathtub while in his Martian form, is discovered by Brace and she steals all of Tim's tapes. Martin and Tim go after the Martian evidence, shrinking the ship  and racing down to the station where Martin ties Brace to her office chair and gags her. Martin then disguises himself as her so he can take her place on the news where Martin's alien form is almost exposed. The broadcast is carefully watched by Elliot Coleye , head of SETI. Tim admits to Martin that he has been videotaping him, but found he also likes Martin and apologizes. As footage from another news report is aired, Tim and Martin escape the station. Tim and Martin escape through the sewers via shrinking/unshrinking device of Martin's and eventually into the hands of Coleye, who take them back to SETI for investigation. At the lab, Tim tricks one of the scientists into growing Martin's ship to normal size, breaching security and allowing Lizzie and Zoot to escape. However, the trio's escape is blocked by two security guards; one of the guards nonfatally shoots Zoot. With the help of a "nerplex," a piece of alien gum that can transform anyone into another life form , given by Zoot to Lizzie, and defeats the security guards. The three eventually succeed in locating Martin, who underwent surgery, involving the removal of Martin's antenna and presumably killing him. When Martin and Zoot reunite, he comes back to life and wakes up. The three then escape SETI headquarters and prepare to bid farewell to Martin, installing a car alternator in place of the damaged electron accelerator. He is intercepted by Coleye, but a SETI official named Armitan, actually Martin's old friend Neenert , saves him by destroying Coleye's gun and tossing Coleye wildly in the air. Then Martin and Neenert flies back to Mars. Eventually, Coleye consumes the piece of nerplex left by Neenert and he's turned into an alien too. While laughing at this, Coleye accidentally swallows the gum, which presumably leaves him permanently in his transformation. He ends up getting caught by his own organization as Tim and Lizzie escapes home. In the end, Martin and Zoot return to Earth with enough supplies to settle down with Tim and Lizzie. Neenert flies Martin's spacecraft back to Mars. Tim initially objects to Martin staying, but a passionate kiss from Lizzie convinces Tim to change his mind. The film ends with Zoot in a washing machine, enjoying an issue of Victoria's Secret.
