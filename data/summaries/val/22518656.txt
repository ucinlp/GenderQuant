After getting pick-pocketed in the subway, Gus' destiny is turned over into the hands of Deechâ€”who promptly burglarizes his home and steals his paintings. To capitalize on his stolen goods, Deech generates interest in Gus' work by creating Geoffrey Boiardi, a fictional artist with a fascinating profile. Geoffrey becomes an overnight sensation while Gus is forced into the shadows of the ever-illusive rising star.
