After selling his house and belongings in East Africa, upper-class black sheep Willie Hale  returns home to England, where he buys a dog and charms his rich father, Lord Leeland , into giving him more money. After reuniting with his old girlfriend, actress Mary Crayle , he meets and falls in love with heiress Dorothy Hope . Dorothy then breaks her engagement to Grand Duke Paul  because she finds bankrupt Willie far more charming. He also makes Willie agree to stop seeing Mary. Mistakenly thinking he has breached this agreement, Dorothy pays Willie off. He sends the money to destitute Paul, who gladly accepts it, showing both Willie's and Paul's true characters to Dorothy. When Dorothy and Willie make up, Lord Leeland laughingly informs them that Dorothy's father is making them a wedding present of a sheep farm in Australia. At least if Willie goes broke this time, Dorothy's father is footing the bill, not him.Frank, Sam, Ronald Colman, A Bio-Bibliography  p. 89
