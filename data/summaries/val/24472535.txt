Arjun finds a cute baby on the road and asks for acting in the ad to its mother who refuses to the proposal. While convincing, the mother faces an accident. Arjun admits her in the hospital and meanwhile takes the baby to the client and gets their approval. Arjun returns back to hospital to find the mother and found left without caring about the baby. Arjun takes the baby to the police station and discusses the issue with police friend. He then takes the baby to his home accompanied by Archana with him.

Both of them set to Pondicherry to search her to find who the baby's real parents are. They find her finally but the lady denies their charge of baby stealing. By some non-violent tortures they grab the details of the real parents. The lady stole the baby from the parents and she along with her boyfriend demand twenty lakh rupees from them to return to them and while on the mission she lost the baby to Arjun. The kidnapper diverts them saying that he is the real parent to Arjun and also orders the baby's parents to give them the money and pick up the kid in a separate remote place. Arjun and Archana arrives there and find that something wrong and runs away with the baby. Both of them are finally trapped among the kidnappers, parents and the police. The due date for handing over the agreement finally comes and Srinivasan unable to catch Arjun finally admits that he could not produce the agreement and therefore he quits from the project while Arjun and Archana arrives there with the document and finally project gets approved.

The parents are very much happy on getting back their baby and seeing their child in the ad and sign the no objection agreement. Arjun and Archana finally unite and romance each other
