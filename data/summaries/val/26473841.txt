MelsA popular Soviet communist name - an abbreviation of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin > Mels, a member of Komsomol , helps break up a stilyagi party. He briefly meets and is intrigued by a hipster girl named Polly, who invites him to hang out with her friends on "Broadway." Mels is drawn to Polly and seeks to win her over by becoming part of their world of colorful fashions, dancing, and loud music. He begins to adopt their fashions and even purchases a saxophone off the black market which he learns to play in the illicit jazz style. His old traditional communist friends shun him, but he remains refreshingly optimistic. Through his jazz career he is able to woo Polly and they consummate their relationship. After dating for a small while Polly eventually reveals she is pregnant although not with his child. Mels denies that the child is not his and insists they will raise the baby together. Polly is kicked from her home by her mother and goes to live with Mels and his family. The baby is born and is clearly not Mels as it is born black, however Mels and his family accepts the child despite this, though Mels remains bitter and this affects his relationship to Polly and in turn Polly's relationship to their friendship circle.
