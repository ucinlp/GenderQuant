 In the cartoon, Tom is seen living the high life in a penthouse, while Jerry is seen with an empty stomach looking for food. Jerry sees a lunchbox at a construction site and jumps into it to have a meal, but the steel beam on which the lunchbox sits is lifted into the air, then slides off, landing  on Tom's patio. Tom grabs the food and uses it to make a Jerry sandwich, but Jerry escapes while Tom is eating it. Tom gives chase, which ultimately leads to Tom falling off the penthouse patio and tumbling across the construction site into a building hosting a dog show and the dogs in the building attacks Tom while biting him and barking at him. Jerry is now in Tom's penthouse, enjoying the high life as Tom was at the start. Jerry drinks some juice by connecting 3 straws and ends up swallowing a whole ice cube. Jerry decides to just take a nap.
