Luis Forest, an aging Falangist writer, has retired to Sitges to devote himself to review his past, write his memoirs and ruminate over his failed marriage. He feels guilty because of his political past and lives in virtual isolation in his large house accompanied only by his dog and Tesla, the housekeeper. His isolation is suddenly interrupted by the unexpected visit of his niece, Mariana. Young and wildly carefree, Mariana has arrived with the excuse to interview her uncle about the biographical book he's writing. The reportage would appear in the magazine where she works with her aunt, Sole, Luis’ estranged wife. Mariana has not seen her uncle in many years and is happy in his company. She has arrived with a mysterious silent photographer, a male friend of foreign origin, Elmyr. They shake up Luis' staid world. Mariana and Elmyr have a close relationship; they argue frequently, smoke some drugs together, and it is evident that they are lovers. Elmyr paints golden panties on Mariana’s body. Mariana’s mother calls Luis to warn him if her daughter is in the company of Elmyr, whom she describes as a drug addict with suicidal tendencies. She also tells Luis that Sole has died unexpectedly. There is not need for him to worry about funeral arrangement since Sole has already been buried and their four children do not want to see him. Flashbacks, tell the story of Luis Forest when he was young. He was smitten with Mari, Mariana's mother, and her sister, Sole. He was first courting Mari, but one dark night by the piano, he made love to Sole thinking that it was her sister. That eventually led him to marry Sole. Their marriage was not happy, in spite of Sole’s efforts, and she ended up leaving her husband years ago. The other sister, Mariana’s mother, in a time in which she was drinking a lot, had a one-night stand with Luis. However, shortly after, she married, José Maria Tey, Luis’ close friend. The past that Luis is preserving in his memoirs is more fiction than truth. He is rewriting the facts, inventing many and softening many more. His book of memoir is full of lies that his niece soon discovers when she offers him to type the manuscript. Slowly, Mariana's taunting and teasing breaks down Luis’ intellectual barriers and, as that happens, she becomes more interested in him. Elmyr is not really a man but a female friend of fragile psychology and suicidal tendencies. Mariana and Elmyr have male lovers who they bring to the house. One night, while Mariana is out in the town, Luis expels Elmyr from the house. Mariana is initially very upset but she calms down kowing that Elmyr is safe in Ibiza. Alone with her uncle, Mariana begins a game of seduction until Luis succumbs. When Mariana’s mother  comes to visit, worried about what he can say about her in his memoirs, it is revealed that Mariana is in fact his daughter. Luis feels guilty of the incestuous relationship they have had and tries to commit suicide.
