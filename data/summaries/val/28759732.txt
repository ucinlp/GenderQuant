Once-successful book editor Suzie Stone who would choose to go to work on Thanksgiving weekend, suddenly gets a visit from her inner child in a form of a seven-year-old girl that only she can see and hear. The inner child who does not want to go away until Susan is happy, keeps commenting on merits of a potential love interest and teaches her how to playfully dance in her living room. Watching the film protagonist slowly melting her ice is another reward of this movie.
