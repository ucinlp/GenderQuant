In an attempt to impress his American girlfriend, Mischa, actor Steve Coogan accepts a commission from the Sunday newspaper, The Observer, to undertake a tour of leading restaurants in the north of England for a column in their monthly food magazine. However, when Mischa, who was expected to accompany Coogan on the tour, insists that they take a break from their relationship and returns to America, Coogan is obliged to search for another companion. After finding that other friends are "busy", he decides with feelings of some ambivalence to invite his former colleague, Rob Brydon, with whom he shares an uneasily competitive relationship. In the course of the trip, they eat a series of gourmet meals and visit sites linked to the Romantic poets Coleridge and Wordsworth, Coogan has casual sex with a couple of women working at their hotels, and the two men indulge in various forms of one-upmanship, including exchanging impersonations of famous actors such as Anthony Hopkins, Sean Connery and most notably Michael Caine. At the end of the trip, Brydon returns to a nondescript suburban home and his evidently loving wife and child, while Coogan comes back to a glamorous but lonely riverside apartment: the closing shots show him staring broodingly out of the window. In the end he calls back his agent to reject a deal for the lead role in a US drama in order to remain close with his family.
