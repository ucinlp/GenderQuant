The story, set in the Heian era, depicts the conflict between Korean painter Yoshihide  and his Japanese patron, the cruel and egotistical daimyo Horikawa . Horikawa demands that Yoshihide decorate the walls of his new temple with an image of Buddha, but Yoshihide refuses, insisting that he cannot paint what he does not see. In Horikawa's realm, Yoshihide can see nothing but the suffering of peasants. He creates several gruesome images that appear to have some sort of magical power.  These all appall Horikawa, and he demands that the paintings be destroyed. Ultimately, Yoshihide asks that he be allowed to portray hell on a screen for the wall of the temple, and Hosokawa agrees. Yoshihide asks for one thing to be in the centre of his painting: a burning carriage with Horikawa in it. Hosokawa agrees to this, but to provide a model for the scene, he has Yoshihide's daughter, Yoshika , chained in the carriage. Yoshihide watches in horror as his daughter is burned alive, before going on to paint his masterpiece. Before the completed screen is unveiled, Yoshihide hangs himself. When Hosokawa looks at the screen, he is horrified to see himself portrayed in hell. The climax of the film is slightly vague, but the audience is led to believe that Horikawa becomes trapped in his own private hell through the power of the portrait.
