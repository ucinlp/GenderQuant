The murder of a prostitute in Nazi-occupied Warsaw in 1942 draws Abwehr Major Grau  into an investigation where the evidence points to the killer being one of three German general officers: General von Seydlitz-Gabler ([[Charles Gray , General Kahlenberg , his chief of staff, and General Tanz . Grau's investigation is cut short by his summary transfer to Paris at the instigation of these officers. After the war, the murder of a third prostitute in Hamburg in 1965 draws the attention of Interpol Inspector Morand . Morand owes a debt of gratitude to Grau for not revealing his connection to the French Resistance during the war. Almost certain there is a connection, Morand reopens the cold case and the movie shifts between the Europe of the 1960s and the Europe of the 1940s. The case in Warsaw remains closed until all three officers meet in Paris in July 1944. Paris is a hotbed of intrigue, with senior Wehrmacht officers plotting to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Kahlenberg is deeply involved in the plot, while von Seydlitz-Gabler, who is aware of its existence, is sitting on the fence, awaiting the outcome. Tanz, who is unaware of the plot, remains loyal to the FÃ¼hrer. On the night of July 19, 1944, Tanz orders his driver, Kurt Hartmann , to procure a prostitute; Tanz butchers her so as to implicate Hartmann, but offers Hartmann the chance to desert, which he accepts. When Grau, who is now a Lieutenant Colonel, learns of the murder, committed in the same manner as the first, he resumes his investigation and concludes that Tanz is the killer. However, his timing is unfortunate. On July 20, 1944, the assassination attempt takes place. When Grau accuses Tanz face to face, the general kills Grau and labels him as one of the plot conspirators to cover his tracks. Years later, Morand begins to tie up the loose ends: he finds no criminal activity from Kahlenberg or Seydlitz-Gabler, but learns of one man who knew which man is the real killer. Morand confronts Tanz at a reunion dinner for Tanz's former panzer division. When Morand produces Hartmann as his witness, Tanz goes into a vacant room and shoots himself.
