Morocco receives many emigrants whose ultimate destination is Europe. Some of them, a minority, make their way to Morocco in the hope of finding asylum: People from CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Togo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Palestine and even Iraq who have fled their countries of origin. About a thousand of them hold a political refugee card granted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Agency . However, having this card does not necessarily make life any easier with Moroccan territory.
