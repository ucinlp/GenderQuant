A flashback takes one to Kodaikanal where Karthik  falls instantly for a gorgeous woman called Jennifer , who is older to him. She is admired and respected by everyone, especially men.

Twists and turns reveal that Jenniferâ€™s husband has died in the Indo-Pak war of 1971. What happens then forms the climax.
