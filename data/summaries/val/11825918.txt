In "a New England city", Frank Skeffington plans to run for a fifth term. Skeffington rose from poverty in an Irish ghetto to become mayor and former governor, and is skilled at using the power of his office and an enormous political machine of ward heelers to receive support from his Irish Catholic base and other demographics. Rumors of graft and abuse of power are widespread, however, and many Catholics and other citizens oppose Skeffington, including the Catholic cardinal and Protestant bishop. Newspaper publisher Amos Force and other members of the city's traditional elite the Irish Catholics replaced also oppose him, and support the candidacy of Kevin McCluskey, a young Catholic lawyer and war veteran with no political experience. Adam Caulfield is a sportswriter for Force's newspaper. His father-in-law, Roger Sugrue, is among those who oppose Skeffington, Caulfield's uncle. The mayor invites Caulfield to observe in person what will be his last election, his "last hurrah", to preserve for history urban politics before radio and television fully changes campaigning. Skeffington prefers old-fashioned, hands-on politics, and attends numerous rallies, luncheons, dinners, and speeches. His influence is such that when Skeffington attends an unpopular old friend's wake, hundreds rush to be present. Disgusted at how the wake becomes another political event, Caulfield leaves; one of the mayor's men explains to him, however, that Skeffington attended to attract mourners to cheer the widow, to whom Skeffington has secretly donated $1,000. After Norman Cass's bank turns down a loan for the city to build a housing development, Skeffington invades the exclusive Plymouth Club to confront him, Force, the bishop, and other members of the elite. The mayor threatens to publicly embarrass Cass's family by appointing his unintelligent son as fire commissioner. The banker is forced to approve the loan, but vows to contribute large amounts of money to defeat Skeffington. McCluskey's campaign arranges for a series of television advertisements, but his ineptness disappoints both the cardinal and bishop. On election night Skeffington's men expect another victory, but McCluskey unexpectedly defeats the incumbent and his machine. As his men argue over why their usual tactics involving large amounts of "money" failed, Skeffington chastises them as if he were unaware of their actions. The mayor confidently states on television that he will run for governor but suffers a heart attack that night, and a large crowd comes to pay respect to the invalid. After Skeffington's last confession, Caulfield, Sugrue, and the mayor's men are at his bedside. When Sugrue suggests that the patient would live his life differently, Skeffington regains consciousness enough to reply "Like Hell I would" before dying.
