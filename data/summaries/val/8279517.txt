{{Expand section}} Delores Quantero is the descendant of Zorro-style hero, Don Quantero, who was granted land by the Spanish crown. This grant, which is still legally valid, now covers the business district of the city. Another descendant, Carlos Manning, has discovered the existence of this document and plots to inherit the fortune by murdering his relatives.
