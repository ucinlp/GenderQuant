Charles Dobbs  is a British secret agent investigating the apparent suicide of Foreign Office official Samuel Fennan. Dobbs becomes suspicious when a wake-up call is made to Fennan's home the next morning. While his wife Elsa  says it was for her, this is discovered to be a lie. Dobbs then suspects that Elsa, a survivor of an extermination camp, might have some clues, but other officials want Dobbs to drop the case. Dobbs privately hires a retired police inspector, Mendel , to quietly make inquiries. As they uncover some horrible implications, Dobbs also discovers that his wife Ann  has been having an affair with a colleague, Dieter Frey  who may have used access to her to gain knowledge of Dobbs' movements.
