{{Inuniverse}} Beaver  gets his heart set on a Bike in the store window. He doesn't know how to get his parents to buy it for him. However, Eddie Haskell  tells him that if he sucks up to his father ([[Christopher McDonald , by signing up for football, he will be sure to get the bike on his upcoming birthday. He signs up for football despite his small size, and is tackled and thrown to the ground many times during practices. On the first day of school five days later, Ward and June  tell Wally to drop Beaver off and pick him up for a few days because he has never ridden his bike there before. At school Beaver sits beside a very pretty girl named Susan Acustis  and has a very kind teacher named Miss Landers . After school Eddie asks Wally to come to the soda shop to see him flirt with Karen . He does not want Beaver to follow them, so Wally leaves him alone at the bike rack telling him he will be back in a second. Beaver is polishing his bike when a punk teenager  comes over and admires it and asks him if he can show him some cool bike tricks. He agrees and the boy shows him some tricks before riding off with the bike. Inside the shop it becomes apparent that Karen likes Wally, not Eddie. When Wally and Eddie come out of the shop and hear that Beaver's bike got stolen they look for it but can't find it. During dinner that night, the boys try to cover up the fact that the bike was stolen, but to no avail. When Ward hears this he is very upset not just at Beaver, but at Wally, because he wasn't watching him. In the boys' bedroom, they get into a fight which sends Beaver's new computer flying out the window. Wally grabs the wire and tries to pull it in and does, but the wire breaks, and it falls out the window and crashes into many pieces. Beaver decides to skip football practice and study instead, and Wally starts spending more time with Karen now instead of him. When he is caught by Ward for skipping practice, Beaver is told that he can quit the team if he wants, but he doesn't. During the last game, he gets a catch and runs it for a touchdown. By the concession stands, he finds the punk with his bike and takes it back. Ward reads Beaver a bedtime story.
