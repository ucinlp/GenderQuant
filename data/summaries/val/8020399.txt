A Russian peasant family is eating dinner when a truck stops in the front yard. The father opens the door of the truck to find a murdered woman and two crying infants in the seat next to her. Forty years later Marie Jones has been summoned to Russia by a notary who claims to have found her long dead parents and the home they owned. As she climbs the steps to his office someone brushes past her. Marie arrives at the house where her mother died and is confronted by an old woman who insists that she should not go to the Kardinovsky farm, where Marie's parents lived. They are interrupted by Anitoly, Marie's guide, the only person willing to venture to the farm at night. The farm sits on an island and is only accessible by a bridge. Marie and Anitoly cross the bridge and stop a few yards from the house. Anitoly tells Marie to stay in the truck while he makes sure there are no animals blocking their path. Marie waits, and then sees what appears to be Anitoly ahead of her, but when she leaves the truck she finds herself alone. Shortly afterwards the truck's engine dies. Marie enters the house with a flashlight and begins investigating. She hears a bang and a child wailing from upstairs, but finds nothing. Marie enters a nursery, and sees, out of the corner of her eye, a woman walking past. When she runs into the hallway she sees the same woman enter another room. Marie follows and comes face to face with her doppelgänger who appears to be soaking wet. She runs out the house in time to see the truck leave. In a panic she chases it and falls into the river where she begins drowning. Marie wakes up in a much warmer and brightly lit room in the house. She meets Nikolai who explains that he is her brother and that he was summoned by the notary. Marie is sceptical, but when he takes her upstairs and shows her their cribs she realises he is being truthful. She tells him what she saw and he explains that seeing your double shows you how you will die. They meet Nikolai's doppelgänger, a bloody, ravaged body, and realise they have to leave the island. As they are ready to flee Nikolai falls through a hole in the floor and vanishes. In her parents' room, Marie witnesses events from the past as she watches her father stab her mother to death on their bed. Screaming, she turns to find her doppelgänger behind her. This time it catches her in the babies' room and seems to suck out part of her soul, leaving her gasping and disoriented. Marie flees the house, taking a boat to the other side of the river as her doppelgänger watches. As Marie runs through the forest, she finds herself before the house again. When she enters, she finds the dining room clean, as it must have been decades earlier. At the table, looking morosely at a birthday cake, is an injured Nikolai. He did not die, but merely fell into the basement. He tells Marie that they were not meant to leave the house. They were supposed to die with their mother and now, on the eve of their birthday, the house has called them to fulfill their destinies at midnight. When the clock strikes midnight, the entire house returns to the state it was in 1966, and they hear their father enter the house. Marie tries to intercept him, hoping to change the past, but Nikolai tells her that it has already happened; the only way to survive would be to escape in the past, where the house cannot touch them. When they try they are separated, and Marie ends up in the back of the truck as her father drives away with the infants, while Nikolai sees the form of his long lost love, Natalie. Marie's father stops at the barn, leaving one baby in a pig's pen for the boars, while he tries to drown the other in the boars' water tank. Marie's injured mother shoots her father in the head and grabs both babies, fleeing to the truck. Nikolai turns to see his lover is now his father and is attacked by the boars. Marie finds her father's now desiccated body in the barn, and is then pushed into a pseudo-past where she realises her father and the notary are the same person. She flees his office in the present and runs into her past self as she comes up the steps, and continues fleeing into the sunlight until she finds herself back in the house, this time between the past and the present, where the apparition of her father explains that he has always loved his children and his wife, and could not let them leave him. She runs from him and finds Nikolai's body being eaten by the boars. When her doppelgänger comes after her, Marie flees to the truck parked outside and drives away. Marie's father's voice comes over the radio, telling her to return and join the family he has created. The bridge that brought her there has been destroyed, and she plunges into the lake, drowning. The film ends with Marie's daughter, Emily, explaining that she knew her mother would never return. It has been months since she left for Russia and she has never had the desire to know what happened to her or her parents, breaking the cycle and leaving her abandoned.
