Elvira Madigan and Sixten Sparre are together in the Danish countryside. Sixten has renounced the military and now claims to be "on the women's side." Elvira, who was the main attraction at her circus, has got her identity back and starts to refer to herself with her real name Hedvig. A friend from Sixten's regiment tries to persuade him to come back, but fails. They have no money or future and try to fish and earn money the best they can - Hedvig sells a picture of herself drawn by Toulouse-Lautrec and is paid to entertain a party with her tightrope walking. But the situation becomes more desperate, and finally they see death as their only option.
