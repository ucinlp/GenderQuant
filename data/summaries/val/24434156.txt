In the not too distant future, society has levied laws against smoking and forced citizens to live in a certain part of town called the "SMOKING SECTION" if one wants to smoke cigarettes. After crossing the line into the smoking ghetto, Cigarettes now cost $63.49 a pack, and are sold on the street corners and underground bars. The unnamed heroine  of the film works in the "Vice Club", an abandoned 1930s era cigarette factory turned club, where a once iconic emblem of a giant cigarette tipping over into a giant ashtray, now sits atop the factory coated with rust like a cancer. Occasionally still tilting into the astray if the wind is strong enough, the giant cigarette squeaks like a siren, going throughout the city. We find the heroine, after her grandmother  is hospitalized with emphysema, the Cigarette Girl attempts to break her addiction to nicotine while also escaping the clutches of her employers, the mob-associated operators of the smoker hangout, the Vice Club. Deciding to start packing a pistol along with her packs of cigarettes, the Cigarette Girl becomes an angel of death when she stops smoking and starts killing on the third day to alleviate her acute psychological withdrawal manifested primarily by the ghost of a cowboy who is always on her back to keep smoking. The film's tag line "She'd kill for a smoke."
