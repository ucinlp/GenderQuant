Alberta leaves her small hometown to move in the city, and moves in with her former babysitter, Celene, who is now a professional dominatrix. Out of money, Alberta decides to impersonate her roommate's identity, lured by the 300$/hour pay rate. While working her first client, Paul, three men break in the house, believing Paul stole half a million dollars from them. Paul defends himself, saying whatever money he has he won at the casino. Alberta flees the scene, grabbing Paul's money on her way out, which leads the robbers to believe she's involved with the theft as well. For the rest of the movie, Alberta and Celene are now trying to deal with the resulting mess.
