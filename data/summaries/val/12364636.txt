Martin Raikes  is a bank investigator who is sent to Monaco to check up on the shady dealings of a movie production. After the business trip, he'll then fly over to London to visit his daughter. When Martin arrives in Monaco, he is met by the film company's CFO, Lela Forin  and washed-up action star Jake Mellows . Something is rotten with the production, though, and Martin senses it. Unfortunately, he sticks his nose in a little too deep for the corrupt bankrollers' tastes, and is soon deemed a threat to them. Martin is first offered a mega-bribe, but he rejects it. As it turns out, the bankrollers are Russian mafia, led by Oleg Butraskaya . Suddenly, Martin finds himself framed for an assassination attempt, and the hostile authorities—on the payroll of the mob—want to kill him. The American authorities are also hot on his trail, investigating him for money laundering, among other false charges. As Martin sifts through the mystery, he reveals the nefarious nature of Oleg's rackets, which include illegal pornography and money laundering. Not knowing whom to trust, he turns to Lela. Soon, she, too, is marked for death, and the two go on the run, before meeting up with Jake, who joins the group. They put their minds together, desperate to find a way to clear their names and survive.
