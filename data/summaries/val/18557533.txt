Wile E. Coyote leaves a telephone at the hole of new his neighbor, Bugs Bunny. He calls, asking to borrow a cup of diced carrots. Bugs' whiskers twitch as he sarcastically looks at Wile's mailbox , and realizes what he's up against. He then mocks him: "Are you in, genius? Are you in, capable? In, solent? In, describable? In, bearable?..." Wile grabs Bugs and ties him to a stake as he prepares to cook Bugs, but Bugs gets the upper hand by hopping on the floorboards, setting off a wine cork that, after it ricochets around the room, triggers Wile E's wall bed that crushes the Coyote (All to the tune of Raymond Scott's [[Powerhouse . Bugs makes his getaway and hops back to his hole. Wile then tries a vacuum cleaner to suck up the rabbit, getting a dynamite decoy instead, before the decoy explodes, he says: "well, the boy has talent"; a cannon shot, which Bugs re-directs at the Coyote , hitting him in the head and leaving it oddly-curved ; next, "Quick-Drying Cement", which dries into a cylindrical block. As Wile E. laughs, saying: "What a wonderful way to cement a friendship", he runs right into the block, which tips over on top of him. Bugs then pops out and says: "Well, now he has concrete evidence that I'm a good neighbor". The final attempt is a 10 billion-volt electric magnet, which Wile E. Coyote turns on after leaving a metal carrot in Bugs' hole . Bugs tricks him and sends the carrot right back at Wile E. Upon releasing the carrot, Bugs' mailbox is also pulled towards the magnet, hitting Wile E. right in the face. To further batter Wile E., Bugs throws out an iron, a frying pan, a garbage bin, and a mallet, as well as his bed and kitchen stove, all of which are attracted to the magnet. However, neither Bugs nor Wile E. expects the magnet to attract everything else with metal properties  their way. The rocket lodges itself in Wile's cave and then explodes along with everything else the magnet attracted, blasting Wile E. and his cave into oblivion like a scene from Tom & Jerry Episode, "The Missing Mouse" as Bugs watches from his hole. All Bugs himself can do is remark: "One thing's for sure: we're the foist country to get a coyote into orbit".
