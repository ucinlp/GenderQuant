Steven Gold  is a struggling medical student who moonlights as a stand-up comedian. It quickly becomes evident that he is lousy at the former and excels at the latter. And yet, when he is given a chance at the big time, he cracks under the pressure. Lilah  is a dedicated housewife that also yearns to be a comic. She has the raw talent but does not have the command of craft that Steven possesses. At first, he doesn't give Lilah the time of day but slowly they bond and he teaches her the fundamentals of stand-up comedy. "All you need is the right gags," Steven tells her, and he's right. Once Lilah has some decent material, she discovers her natural gift of making people laugh. An uneasy friendship develops between the two and the personal conflicts they must resolve: Steven's desire to make it big vs. his inability to do so and Lilah's love of comedy vs. her love for her family. Steven also develops a romantic attraction to Lilah, which she rejects. Steven expresses his anger and frustration by performing a sarcastic rendition of Gene Kelly's famous dance routine from Singin' in the Rain. The film culminates with a competition at the comedy club where Steven, Lilah and other aspiring comedians have been performing. Television executives are in the audience, and the winner of the competition is promised a chance at stardom. As they compete on stage, the characters also grapple with conflicts between their desires for success on stage versus their loyalties to one another and the expectations of their families. After the final tallies from the judges, Lilah is declared winner and Steven is second place, only gaining interest of two of the five judges. But Lilah declines, and leaves before the announcement of the winner is declared. She leaves with her husband telling him she won, but it's good enough with her family giving support. They leave the Gas Station and the two share ideas for her next set. Inside, Steven is declared the winner of the show.
