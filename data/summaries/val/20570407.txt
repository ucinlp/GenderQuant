Megamind  is a super-intelligent alien, and the supervillian of Metro City. He continually battles - and loses - against his nemesis, Metro Man , a rivalry that has extended since the two arrived on Earth as infants. On the day of dedication of a museum in Metro Man's honor, Megamind and his sidekick Minion  kidnap reporter Roxanne Ritchi  to lure Metro Man into a copper-lined observatory. Inside, Metro Man appears to become weak from the copper, and everyone is surprised when Megamind's death ray appears to kill Metro Man. Megamind revels in his victory, but this is short-lived as without a nemesis, his villainy has no purpose. While attempting to destroy the Metro Man museum, Megamind uses a holographic disguise of the curator, Bernard , to talk with Roxanne. She gives him the idea of creating a serum containing Metro Man's DNA to inject in a worthy target, thus creating a new superhero for Megamind to fight. Later, as Megamind finishes the serum in his lair and locates a worthy target, Roxanne sneaks into the lair, and in the resulting chaos, Megamind injects the serum into Roxanne's dimwitted camera man, Hal . Megamind disguises himself as Hal's "space dad" to groom the new hero into shape to fight Megamind in a few days; Hal takes the superhero alias of "Tighten", a result of mishearing Megamind's suggestion of Titan. During this, Megamind, in the Bernard disguise, continues to see Roxanne and becomes close to her, unaware that Hal also had romantic interests in her. Minion expresses discontent at Megamind's lack of villainy and angrily leaves him. On the night before the battle, while dining with Roxanne, the holographic disguise fails revealing his identity, and Roxanne leaves him. Furthermore, he loses track of his invisible car that has the anti-serum to restore Hal to normal. Upset, he vows to fight Hal the next day, but Hal does not show up at the appointed time. Megamind finds a bitter and heart-broken Hal having used his powers for ill-gotten gains. Megamind is horrified at this change and attempts to convince Hal to be a "hero" by revealing how he has manipulated Hal. Hal realizes he has been toyed with and battles Megamind. Megamind attempts to capture Hal in a copper-lined trap, but it fails to weaken Hal, and the villain is forced to flee Metro City, while Hal begins to threaten the city with his powers. Megamind meets with Roxanne who takes him to Metro Man's secret lair, and both are surprised to find Metro Man there. The former hero explains on the fateful day, he had an epiphany and pretended to be killed as to forego the superhero career and become a musician. He refuses to help stop Hal. Roxanne tries to convince Megamind that he could be the hero, but Megamind has resigned himself to be the villain and turns himself in at prison. When Hal kidnaps Roxanne and threatens her life if Megamind does not fight him, Megamind has a change of heart and requests the warden to let him go, surprised to find the warden is Minion in disguise, having returned to help out. Megamind and Minion fight Hal by holographically disguising themselves as Metro Man and Megamind, respectively, but a slip of the tongue reveals their true identity. As the disguise is broken, another battle ensues. In the fray, Megamind discovers his lost invisible car. He grabs the anti-serum and heroically injects Hal with it, reverting the superhero to a normal man. Hal is taken away while Roxanne convinces Metro City's citizens that Megamind chose to be their hero. Later, Megamind and Roxanne's relationship has become close, and the city welcomes Megamind as their new protector, while a disguised Metro Man, hidden in the crowd, quietly congratulates him.
