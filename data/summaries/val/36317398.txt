In the 14th Century half of Eurasia is occupied by the Golden Horde. Europe waits in trepidation for its attack, anticipating the death of the Christian civilization. The Great Khan is killed by his brother Janibeg and their mother Taidula should now pass judgment, to persecute the conspirator or to bless him for the reign. The film tells the story of how Saint Alexius, the Metropolitan of Moscow and Wonderworker of All Russia, healed Taidula from blindness, in 1357.
