Kurtwood Smith plays Myron Castleman,<ref nameKurtwood Smith Biography |workhttp://www.cbs.com/primetime/worst_week/bio/kurtwood_smith/bio.php }} an everyman who keeps repeating the same hour of his life, from 12:01 PM to 1:00 PM. The character is fully aware that the sixty-minute time loop is occurring, although no one else appears to be aware of the repeating hour. Each time the hour resets, Myron retains his memory . Myron soon becomes bored, irritated, and later insanely furious, going so far as to scream at his secretary and toss his briefcase into traffic. Despite his best attempts to understand what is happening, he cannot figure it out, so he talks to a scientist who studies time loops. Although reluctant at first, the doctor believes him, and tells him that he is entirely helpless to prevent the time bounce. A nearly hysterical Myron shouts that he is God, and he attempts to break the loop by shooting himself, as he reappears, alive. The time is 12:01 PM. Myron realizes that he is trapped in the loop for eternity and finally accepts this, looking around in hopelessness.
