When Porky and Gabby Goat realize that they overslept to 10:00 after their alarm goes off at 06:00, they end up rushing to work at Peter Piper Pickled Peppers and sneaking in. When it came to clocking in, Gabby tries to turn the clock back a few hours, but ends up struggling and the clock goes crazy. Their boss (played by [[Spike and Tyke  catches them and states that if they weren't going to make it, he would've sent their work to them. The boss warns them that if they are late one more time, they are fired. The boss orders them to get to work. Later that night at 08:00, Porky Pig sets the alarm clock as Gabby complains about having to go to bed early. Porky reminds Gabby that if they are late again, they will be fired. Porky climbs into bed and they both fall asleep until a bunch of cats next door wake them up. Later that night, the moon comes out and its light wakes up Porky. One of Porky's attempts to close the window ends up wrecking his bed. This also disturbs Gabby. Gabby found that unbelievable. As the night progresses, a thunderstorm occurs while Porky is sleeping in Gabby's bed. Porky closes the window only for a leak in the roof to disturb him and Gabby. Gabby opens an umbrella in the house with Porky telling him that it's bad luck. Gabby ignores Porky's statement until lightning destroys the umbrella. When Gabby quotes that he should try sleeping under Niagara Falls, a lot of water comes through the roof and down on them. The next morning, Porky and Gabby are shown sleeping in the drawers when the alarm clock goes off at 06:00. They get themselves ready and drive off to work. When Porky and Gabby arrive at Peter Piper Pickled Peppers, they see a sign on the door that says "Closed Sunday." Porky and Gabby drive home, and when they climb back into the drawers to sleep, the alarm clock goes off again at 06:15 and Porky hits it with a mallet.
