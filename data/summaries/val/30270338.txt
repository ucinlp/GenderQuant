After the untimely death of a small-town church choir director  in Georgia, Vi Rose Hill , a no-nonsense mother raising two teens alone, takes control of the choir using the traditional Gospel style that their Pastor Dale  approves of. However, the director's widow, G. G. Sparrow , the main benefactor to the church, believes she should have been given the position. As in previous years, the choir reaches the regional finals of the national amateur "Joyful Noise" competition, only to be disappointed when a rival choir beats them. Tough times in the town have led to budget problems that threaten to close down the choir, at the same time as the town needs the choir's inspiring music more than ever. Vi Rose has a son, Walter , who has Asperger syndrome, and a talented, pretty and ready-to-date daughter, Olivia . But not ready to date under her mothers household rules. G. G. has recently begun caring for her rebellious, drifter grandson, Randy . A romance blossoms between Olivia and Randy, which is strongly opposed by Vi Rose. Olivia also has a rival suitor, Manny . At Randy's urging, G. G., Olivia and most of the choir come to believe that some more contemporary arrangements  would be more successful for the choir. It also turns out that the choir has a chance at the national finals of the competition when the rival choir is found to have cheated by hiring professionals. But the pastor says that the church will not sponsor the choir unless they continue to use their reverent, traditional style. Vi Rose's husband, Marcus , enlisted in the army after having trouble finding work at home, but his prolonged absence has saddened his family and causes additional tension between Vi Rose and Olivia. Meanwhile, a vivacious member of the choir who choreographs their routines, Earla , after a long dry stretch, finds passion first with Mr. Hsu , whose weak heart gives way by morning, and later with Justin . The town's tough times forces another choir member, Caleb , and his family out of business. Vi Rose and G. G. come to blows in a confrontation, Olivia's frustration with her mother boils over, and G. G. threatens Pastor Dale with disendowing the church if the choir is not allowed to compete in the finals with the new arrangements. During the movie Randy befriends Walter and begins to teach him how to play the piano. One day, while at the waterfall Randy and Walter are hanging out as Manny arrives. Randy and Manny begin to fight over Olivia ending with Walter giving Manny a bloody nose. When returning home Walter brags to Vi Rose about the fight. Angered by the news, she throws out Randy and tells him to leave her family alone. The choir travels to Los Angeles for the final, feeling very unsettled. Vi Rose and Olivia have a fight and Vi Rose slaps Olivia. Tough competition presents itself in the form of a choir made up of cute pre-teens, with a charismatic young soloist . But Vi Rose, G. G., Olivia and Randy pull the choir together and they give a rousing performance, using the new arrangements and choreography, capturing first place. The choir returns to town in triumph, Marcus comes home to his family, Vi Rose tacitly gives in to the inevitable relationship between Olivia and Randy, and all ends happily. Earla and Justin get married and on the same day Marcus comes back.
