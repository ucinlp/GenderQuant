Feyzee hopes to be a chef, much against the aspirations of his father. He goes to Switzerland to study hotel management in University of Lausanne and when he returns with much fanfare after the course, it is revealed that he has done a chef's course secretly and not the hotel management. This shatters Razaq's dream of opening a five-star hotel in his home town Kozhikode. This revelation costs Feyzee a marriage proposal from a wealthy family. Razaq wanted him to marry a business tycoon's daughter Shahana . Razaq virtually disowns Feyzee and even takes away his passport and credit cards so that Feyzee cannot go to London where he has already got a job.

Feyzee collects money from the employees and renovates and reopens the restaurant with the help of Shahana. The restaurant becomes a grand success thus enabling them to clear the debts. Feyzee wants to go to France to pursue his career and he gets an offer as well. But before he could go, Kareem asks Feyzee to visit his friend called Narayanan Krishnan in Madurai.  Kareem was funding him in his project of feeding the poor. On seeing how poor people are struggling in India for food, Feyzee now understands the meaning of Kareem's words that "anyone can fill a stomach, but a good cook should fill the heart as well". By the time Feyzee comes back, Karim goes for a pilgrimage never to return again. Feyzee changes his mind and decides to stay with Ustad Hotel. He marries Shahana who helps him run the restaurant. Feyzee's rich father also changes his mind and supports the restaurant changing it to a profitable one.
