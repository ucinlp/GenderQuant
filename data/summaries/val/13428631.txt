A robot named Elektronic escapes from Professor Gromov's laboratory. The robot looks exactly like Sergey  Syroezhkin, the boy from the magazine cover, which was chosen by Gromov as a model to construct Elektronic. By coincidence, the double meets its prototype. 6-grader Serezha cunningly suggests that Elektronik should impersonate him - go to school instead of him and even live in his home. His plan works, as no one can tell the difference between them. Serezha's teachers delight in a very gifted pupil, who suddenly shows unbelievable talents in math, gymnastics, drawing and even singing. Sergey's parents do not suspect his trick and are glad of their pseudo-son's progress. However, eventually the boy realizes that as the robot takes over "his" life, he may be out of business... At the same time, "somewhere abroad", a gang of criminals operates. It is headed by a criminal authority known as Stump. He tells Urrie, who is the best in their gang, to find and kidnap Elektronic. They want to organize a "crime of the century" with the use of his extraordinary abilities.
