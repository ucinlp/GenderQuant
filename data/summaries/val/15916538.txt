Dinanath Singh  is honored by the Indian Government, which is televised live. While receiving the honors, Dinanath informs the Government that his village is still without electricity, and he is promised that electricity will be provided in his village immediately. And electricity is provided in the village. Dina Nath's son, Karan , who is in Mumbai, hears of this and returns to the village along with a C-Band ten foot satellite dish and a super flat stereo television Dinanath has one more son Ajay , who is in Delhi after hearing this he also came back. When the satellite is set up, the villagers are thrilled by the TV shows. This helps create a running gag of copying TV culture into the rural lives. The changes lead to the village priest  complaining to Chotey Thakur Rudra Pratap Singh  that the villagers are turning away from his temple and worship. Rudra is not concerned as he himself has a TV set in his home. But when the priest informs Rudra that his sister, Kesar  and Karan are in love, Rudra makes a threat to destroy Karan and all of the village in the presence of a TV crew filming the whole drama and telecasting it live worldwide. The plot comes to a culmination when, angered by Karan's antics, Rudra arrives to destroy the village. The villagers stand up to the exploitation and fight Rudra and his goons. Finally Rudra is killed at the hands of Karan.
