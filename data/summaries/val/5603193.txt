Two convicts dig a tunnel to escape from prison, but end up in the warden's office, after making a detour around a burst water pipe. They then disguise themselves as painters and walk out through the front gates. They later climb into a limousine carrying two visiting French police chiefs, steal their suits and throw the two men out of the car. The two convicts, now disguised as dignitaries, are then driven back to the prison to have dinner with the warden. Later, while visiting the cells, they are recognised and marched back to their own cell.
