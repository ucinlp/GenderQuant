Inspired by a story that appeared in a 1950s newspaper, this short film plays out a year in the life of a young girl, Mouche. Deemed too skinny to make a living at the Moulin Rouge, Mouche is cast out and saved from suicide by a group of puppets traveling from town to town performing street puppet shows for a few paltry francs. She joins them on their journey and together they become quite an attraction earning more money than they have ever made. In turn, the puppets become Mouche’s beloved family, yet behind them lurks a cruel and abusive man who is desperately in love with her. “It would have all been so perfect if not for the puppeteer.” Mouche must make a decision, to stay for the love of the puppets or leave to escape the terrible wrath of the puppeteer.
