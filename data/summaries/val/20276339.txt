The film tells the story of a bristly-faced resident expat, Irwin, and his friends as they experience their second coming-of-age in New York City. For Irwin, there are “women” and then there are “girls”: women want to get married and girls just want to have fun. For the single Anny, there are three types of men: married, gay and idiots. Polish polka bars, confusing self-help books and a mythical hooker who never sleeps with her clients confound the friends’ American journey.
