Yogeshwaran, simply known as Yogi , and his gang of three men live in a slum on the edge making a living out of robberies and murders and having no human emotions. Yogi, in particular, has a dark secret about his bad past, which he keeps to himself. One day during a robbing spree, he is chased by the police. He gets into a car parked by a woman in front of a fruit shop and manages to flee, when he suddenly hears the cry of a child, finding a three month old baby in the back seat of the car. He abandons the car and leaves the baby in the car, but as he hears the baby crying, he is moved and the human being in him wakes up. He gets back to shove the baby into a large shopping bag and takes it home with him. He from them hides the baby from the rest of his gang and tries to take care of the baby alone. Yogi then, holding at gunpoint, coerces Rajasulochana , a young mother hailing from Andhra Pradesh and deserted by her husband, to breastfeed that baby. Meanwhile it is revealed, that the child's real mother Caroline  is despearate to get her child back, whilst her husband Linden , happening to be merely the step father of the baby, searches with the help of rowdys for the baby, which he actually wants dead. In the meantime, Yogi slowly gets transformed, turning into a new man thanks to the baby, which apparently prompts feelings in him, even planning to keep and bring up the child himself. A flashback reveals his past, where he had an atrocious childhood as he was terrorized by his sadistic father , a beggar, who was responsible for the death of his mother and sister and for making Yogi himself a brute. However, he changes his plans and decides to reunite the baby with its mother, but unfortunately the child slips into the hands of her husband Linden. Yogi gets to know that Linden wants to kill the baby and tries to prevent that and to save the baby.
