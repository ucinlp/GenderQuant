For the First Time follows the lives of a couple from two worlds. Seth  is a rich, impulsive playboy who runs away from serious relationships and doesn’t give much thought to the women he goes out with. Sophia  is a prude, ambitious girl who feels responsible for the tragedy she once encountered and with a scar to constantly remind her about this unfortunate experience. When the two accidentally meet in Santorini, their differences did not stop them from spending one unforgettable summer together — that is until Seth runs away again, scared of the unusual feeling that is happening within him. Seth soon realizes his mistake and comes back to Manila to try his best to regain Pia's affection. Conflicts in land ownership and businesses of their parents are now parts of a wall that is growing in between them.http://forthefirsttime.yehey.com/experience_synopsis.html
