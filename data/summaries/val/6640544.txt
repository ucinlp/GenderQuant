Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria  clashes with his father, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria , over implementing progressive policies for their country. Ava Gardner plays his mother Empress Elisabeth. Rudolf soon feels he is a man born at the wrong time in a country that does not realize the need for social reform. The Prince of Wales , later to become Britain's King Edward VII, provides comic relief. Rudolf finds refuge from a loveless marriage with Princess St√©phanie  by taking a mistress, Baroness Maria Vetsera . Their untimely demise at Mayerling, the imperial family's hunting lodge, is cloaked in mystery, but the film's ending suggests the two lovers made a suicide pact when they decided they could not live in a world without love or prospects for peace.
