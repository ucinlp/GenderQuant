A group of common merchants in Edo  in the mid-1800s is really a band of assassins available for hire. Each assassin has his or her own unique killing style. But one assassin is killing other assassins, and the survivors must find out who is doing it before they are all killed. The rogue killer is referred to as "Copper" in the film, a reference to the assassin's gruesome calling card, which is a copper coin left in the mouth of each victim. The ultimate realization that "Copper" commands an army of assassins simply means that the climax involves an orgy of assassinations.
