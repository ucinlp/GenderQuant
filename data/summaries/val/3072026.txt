The movie takes place in late 1920s Berlin. It opens with Paul being questioned by police about a note he had written. The scene then fades out, and the movie shows what happened. Paul, a shy virgin who is tired of being alone and heartbroken, is friends with an openly gay boy, Guenther. Paul is staying at Guenther's parents'  country home, along with his sister Hilde, over the weekend. Paul is madly in love with Hilde, although she has no interest in committing to a relationship with him. Guenther invites some people over to have an all night party, filled with alcohol, music, and sex. It is one of their last parties, since Paul and Guenther have made a suicide pact. Guenther and his sister Hilde clearly have feelings for the same boy, which complicates the brother-sister relationship. Guenther, Paul and Hilde go through a series of couplings, conversation and partying before proceeding to their parents' apartment in the city. There the drama ends with gun shots. The question is what actually happened. The film is based on a true story, the so-called Steglitz student tragedy.
