Esther  is a disillusioned and bitter nursing home resident who shares much with her attendant, Michael , in terms of personal sacrifices that they have both made. Esther also hides a dark secret. Michael has spent his life looking after his cancer-stricken late mother and now faces rejection from his fiancee's father. Michael makes it his mission to improve the last years of Esther's life. Aided with a locket with her lost love's photograph, Michael searches for the elusive love of Esther's life. But ironically it is Esther that does the greatest favour for Michael by vouching for him when he's accused of a murder in the nursing home.Family Drama - The Locket All Movie Guide.
