Firecracker is a tale of murder in small town Wamego, Kansas. The film portrays abuse, suffering, denial, and dreams of escape. Jimmy , meek, reclusive, and talented, is emotionally imprisoned by his abusive, alcoholic older brother David  and fanatically religious mother Eleanor . At night Jimmy finds escape in a traveling sideshow carnival. Unlike its drab, depressing daytime reality, the carnival becomes a nightly glittering solitaire on the prairie, beckoning all around to its illusions and make-believe. With a guise of red satin and a heavenly voice, Sandra , billed as an “oddity of nature,” is the carnival’s premier attraction. Yearning for a way out, Jimmy befriends Sandra, unaware that her imprisonment and degradation, at the hands of Frank , the carnival owner, mirrors his own. Sandra, taken by his innocence, finds her own inner strength and suppressed dreams. When David disappears, the metaphorical white-picket fences collapse, leaving raw emotions exposed. Throughout the film Police Chief Ed  searches for truth, uncovering bits of evidence suggesting deceit, abuse, murder, and cover-up. Through her investigation she is led closer to the truth and the lives of those involved.
