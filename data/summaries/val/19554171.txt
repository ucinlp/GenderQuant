{{plot}} At a satellite base in Northern Germany, a worker named Freidrich , delivering secret codes finds a Cocker Spaniel puppy outside his office. He brings the puppy inside, showing her to his Bloodhound, Rex. Rex senses something is wrong with the puppy and starts to bark at her, making the worker take him outside. Both are locked out of the office. Rex looks in the window to see that the dog is Kitty Galore , an evil female hairless cat. Rex turns out to be a dog agent and reports to HQ. In San Francisco, Diggs , a German Shepherd police dog and his master, Shane  are called to a hostage situation at Crazy Carlito's used car lot. Diggs deliberately ignores Shane's commands, attacking Crazy Carlito  and causing him to release a device that Diggs grabs which causes the car lot office to blow up. Butch, an Anatolian Shepherd,  and Lou , now the top dog of D.O.G. HQ, are watching footage of the incident. Lou, wants Diggs to be an agent with Butch as his mentor  to help bring down Kitty Galore. At the police station, Diggs is suspended and sent back into the kennels. Shane wants to adopt Diggs but the police will not allow it. With Diggs alone, Butch recruits him to D.O.G. HQ. Lou shows them a video from Kitty Galore who is planning to broadcast a sound that will drive all dogs completely insane all around the world, and without the dogs to protect the humans, she will enslave all mankind. Lou sends them on a mission to find Seamus, a stool pigeon that Kitty has been trying to find that can lead them to Kitty. After tracking down Seamus, Diggs and Butch meet a M.E.O.W.S.  agent named Catherine  who was after Seamus for the same reason the dogs were. She reveals that Kitty Galore was once an agent named Ivana Clawyu who worked for M.E.O.W.S. until a mission at a cosmetics factory during which a guard dog chased her into a vat of hair removal cream. This caused her to lose all her fur, making her unrecognizable and humiliated by her fellow agents and her owners. Since then, Ivana went rogue, changing her name to Kitty Galore and has been plotting her revenge, not only on dogs, but cats and humans as well. After bringing Catherine to HQ, Lou is contacted by Tab Lazenby , the head of M.E.O.W.S and they form an alliance to take down Kitty Galore. At a cat lady's home,they discover about the middlecat who has been sending parts of stolen technology to kitty using other pigeons that work for her but claims that he does not know where she is hiding. Needing help to find out where Kitty could be hiding, they go see Mr. Tinkles  who is locked up in a secret prison. He refuses to help them fight Kitty he gives a hint to where she is. Kitty discovers that cats and dogs are working together and hires two Scottish tabby mercenaries named Angus and Duncan MacDougall  to assassinate Seamus on the boat returning from the prison.On the boat Diggs subdues Angus and throws him overboard, disobeying Butch. After getting fed up with Diggs not listening to his commands, Butch votes him off the team and leaves with Seamus. Catherine takes Diggs to her house and learns that he has been in and out of kennels his whole life due to the fact he never trusted anybody but himself. But Catherine points out that if he is like that, nobody can help him either. She takes him to the M.E.O.W.S. HQ. and learn that Kitty is hiding at a fairground with her new master, an amateur magician named Chuck the Magnificent . Not long after arriving at the fairground, Diggs and Catherine are captured by Kitty Galore and Paws, Kitty's assistant, and reveals her plans to send the "Call of the Wild" via an orbiting satellite, which only dogs can hear through televisions, radios and cell phones to cause them to act crazy towards their humans. They will then be put in the kennels where they will spend the rest of their lives neglected. Diggs and Catherine however escape and meet up with Butch and Seamus. Kitty uses the roof of the fairground's flying swings ride as the satellite dish to transmit the signal. Butch, Diggs, Seamus and Catherine reach the roof. Seamus accidentally activates the signal but Diggs tricks Paws into destroying the satellite and Kitty lands in the magicians hat with the humans thinking it was a stunt, while Diggs and the others escape. After the mission, Diggs goes to live with Shane before coming to H.Q. to learn that Mr.Tinkles has escaped from prison with the middlecat , so Diggs, Butch, Seamus, and Catherine go to stop him. In a post-credits scene, Mr. Tinkles tries to order a cream and says "Cats rule!"
