 Tom is chasing Jerry through the house, then bumps into a table and breaks an ornament abd Tom gets scolded by Joan. While Tom is cleaning the mess, he sees an advertisement on the newspaper, and gets interested in the ad and leaves for the given location. Tom walks along a road and sees the creepy house, enters the place and a witch  comes in riding on her broom. Seeing the job is less appealing than he thought, Tom tries to leave but the witch grabs Tom on her broomstick. She then gives her broom a kick and they take off. During the ride, the witch loses her hat. Tom had taken it and uses it to parachute down, but the witch grabs Tom, they return to the house and the witch tells Tom that he gets the job. Tom is left to sleep in a casket. As the witch retires, Tom looks at her broom and decides to take it on a joyride. He gets the hang of riding a broomstick by himself and does a few tricks. Tom then flies by his house spying Jerry, who thinks that he saw something, Jerry then opens the front door and gets knocked down by Tom, who then gets off the broom and points to Jerry. The broom hits Jerry and sweeps him into a dustpan. Tom leaves and returns to the witch's house where the witch is waiting for him. She is very angry about Tom taking her broomstick. The broom takes off on a painful ride with Tom on it. The broom drags Tom's head through the ceiling, causes him to bounce down the stairs, and into a table. The broom then acts like a pogo stick with Tom holding on to it. However, Tom wakes up to see Joan shaking the broomstick. Realising it was only a dream, Tom is relieved and goes back to clearing up his mess. He then decides to sit on the broom and gives it a kick. Before he can react, the broom takes off with him on it, sailing towards the night sky. Joan and Jerry see this and Joan says "Now, what's that cat up to..?".
