A nameless horse butcher, whose wife left him soon after their autistic daughter was born, operates his own business while trying to raise the daughter. Despite that she has become a teenager, the butcher continues to wash her like a baby, and struggles to resist the temptation of committing incest. On the day of the daughter's menstruation, the butcher misinterprets the situation and assumes that she has been raped by a worker, whom he immediately seeks out and stabs as revenge. The butcher is imprisoned for the assault and is forced to sell his butcher shop and apartment.
