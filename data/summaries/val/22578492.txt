Middle-aged and highly successful lawyer Bertrand Beauvois  is hired by Monaco businessman Louis Lassalle  to defend his mother Ã‰dith Lassalle , who has killed her former lover. Lassalle assigns a bodyguardto Beauvois, Christophe Abadi . Audrey Varella , a beautiful local TV weather girl, who is highly promiscuous, and whose previous lovers include Christophe, enamors Beauvois, hoping to make a better life with him. This despite the warnings of Christopher to Beauvois, who have formed a bond of friendship, to stay away from her. Audrey spends all her time with Beauvois, including nights of exhausting wild sex, and Beauvois entreats Christopher to do something that she should disappear from his life. He then continues to the court, for his final plead in the Lassalle case. After having sex with her, Christopher pushes Audrey and her scooter from the road, and kills her. Beauvois willingly takes the blame. In one of the last scenes we see Mrs. Lassalle being freed prison after only one year of imprisonment, while Beauvois remains among the inmates.
