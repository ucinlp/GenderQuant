The film stars Pat Healy and Kene Holliday as Martin and Clarence, two men who get involved in a record industry talent scouting scheme. In the film, real people performed in the audition scenes without knowing it was actually a film shoot. The interactions between the lead actors and the unsuspecting musicians were recorded with hidden cameras. This was integrated into the final product, resulting in a blend of fact and fiction.Plot synopsis at IMDB Accessed May 15th, 2009
