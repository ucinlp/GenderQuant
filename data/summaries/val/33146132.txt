Eloise , the daughter of the renowned swordsman D'Artagnan  of the famed Three Musketeers, is devoted to her studies at a convent in Southern France, despite her abilities with the sword. The year is 1654. Eloise is enthusiastic about honour and faithfulness, and shows an affection to the poor. When an escaped slave from the estate of the evil Duke of Crassac  seeks refuge at the convent, the Mother Superior  is murdered by the Duke's soldiers. During the attack, Eloise learns of the Duke's dastardly plans, which involve throwing the nation into chaos, making it easier for the Duke to overthrow the King and seize power. Eloise escapes the evil Duke's men and meets a young poet, Quentin , who joins her on her journey to reunite with her famous father and his old compatriots in order to take action against the evil Duke. D'Artagan, however, now lives a quiet life teaching fencing and is not interested in doing battle with the Duke. Eloise appeals to her father's chivalry, and together they ride to face the Duke and his evil men.{{cite web}}
