The cartoon centers around Porky Pig and Daffy Duck's attempts to escape the Broken Arms Hotel manager without paying their bill . Daffy Duck gambles away all his money in a game of Craps while in the elevator. Because Daffy now has no money, he cannot pay the bill; therefore, he and Porky try to escape by way of many zany gags. The hotel manager eventually gets the upper hand and locks them up in a hotel room until they pay up. Winter is approaching, and Daffy is beginning to lose his sanity. Porky  suggests they call Bugs Bunny for advice. Daffy concurs and tries to call the rabbit for advice. But as it turns out, Bugs Bunny himself  is locked up in the room next door.
