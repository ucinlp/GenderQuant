Luke  invites his friend Matt  and Matt's girlfriend, Suzie  to join him as he sails to a coral reef. Also joining them is Matt's sister, and Luke's girlfriend, Kate  and fellow sailor Warren . On the second day of their journey, the yacht strikes a reef and capsizes when the keel is destroyed. With the current taking them further away from land, Luke gathers supplies from the overturned vessel with the intention of swimming to nearby Turtle Island. With the group gathered on top of the overturned hull, Warren activates the yacht's EPIRB, but Luke informs him that it is an older model that requires a plane to fly overhead to receive the signal. When Luke suggests the others to join him in swimming to the island , Warren refuses as he believes the water is shark-infested. With encouragement Kate, Suzie and Matt follow Luke into the water as he begins the journey. During their journey, the group find the carcass of a sea turtle that has had its head bitten off. On the overturned yacht, Warren spots a large Great White Shark circling the vessel. Soon, the group are also stalked by  the same shark. It approaches them several times, even brushing past Kate, before leaving. Kate and Suzie are supported by Matt and Luke as they are both in shock. However, during her encounter, Kate lost the bodyboard she was using as a flotation device. When Matt goes to retrieve it, he is attacked by the shark and his legs are severed. He is comforted by the group, but quickly dies. As night falls, Luke, Kate and Suzie are once more stalked by the shark. Suzie blames Luke for talking the group into swimming to an island he has seemingly lost. In the morning, the group has drifted to a shallow area of the reef, where they are able to stand and rest. In the distance, they can see a larger rock formation protruding from the water, and they swim towards it. Paranoia affects the group as they continue. They share a laugh when they mistake a dolphin for the shark that took Matt. However, the shark soon returns and kills Suzie. Luke and Kate rest on the reef, and they both declare their love for each other. They begin to swim the final distance to the rocks as the shark closes in. Luke assists Kate in climbing to safety, but as he climbs onto the rocks the shark seizes him and drags him beneath the water. The written epilogue reveals that Kate was rescued by a fishing boat the following day, however extensive searches failed to locate Warren or the vessel.
