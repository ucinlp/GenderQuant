After Damini witnesses her brother-in-law raping a servant's teenage daughter, she decides to testify, much against her in-laws' wishes. Even Shekhar seems to be reluctant to aid her. The case stands in court, but Indrajit Chaddha, a corrupt lawyer fighting for thr Guptas, embarrasses Damini by asking her uncomfortable questions in front of the court. Chaddha also succeeds in proving that Damini has mental problems. Damini is declared insane and sent to an lunatic asylum. Her confidence is crippled, but she soon recovers and manages to escape. Damini runs into Govind, an ex-lawyer. It is revealed that Govind's girlfriend was a victim and Govind failed to bring the criminals to justice. On Damini's insistence, he reluctantly agrees to see into the case. When Chaddha meets Govind personally, Govind decides to come out of his retirement. The case is reopened. However, this time, Govind turns the tables and methodically thwarts all the pressure tactics of the villains. Now, however, it is revealed that Urmi, the victim, committed suicide, which both Damini and Govind suspect as foul play from side of police. However, things turn awry for Gupta's too when Bajaj decides to kill Shekhar as he might buckle under the pressure. He also sends his goons to kill Damini. Damini escapes and counter-attacks the goons. Here, the judge is tired of waiting and is about to give a decision in Gupta's favour. Damini enters just in time to declare that she wants to withdraw the case. Govind tries to talk her out, but she vents her anger on Chaddha and the others for the things that happened. Shekhar, who is thoroughly ashamed of himself, steps in and testifies. He tells the truth and asks Damini's pardon. On basis of his testimony, the villains are arrested while Shekhar is given a lighter sentence. Govind leaves happily, while Mamta's father is seen thanking him and Damini.
