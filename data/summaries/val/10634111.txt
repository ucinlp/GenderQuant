Cuco Gomez-Gomez has just been found in bed --DEAD! And every single one of his meddling neighbors in the shabby live-in hotel has a theory on who did it and why. Actor/writer-director Francisco Lorite and an eclectic ensemble cast of up-and-coming actors, bring you a stylized, off-kilter comedy-noir, part murder mystery, part mockumentary.
