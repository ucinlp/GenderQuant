Max has to investigate a contaminated jungle, and travels from outer space to the center of the earth in his quest to unveil this mystery. At the beginning of the story it is mentioned that the last battle against Extroyer has permanently crippled the Adrenalink system, forcing Max to go back to an updated version of Going Turbo!, . In this movie, a new enemy, the nefarious Doctor Gregor Mendel makes his first presentation, and it is revealed that Iago has been working for him from the beginning, secretly stealing technology from Eclipse. Mendel has constructed an android named Cytro, who's prime directive is help him in his plans to take control of the contaminated jungle and destroy Max in the process. Accidentally, the programming of Cytro is scrambled and for a couple of hours thinks he must protect Max instead of fighting him. However, he is aware of the malfunction, and constantly mentions how much time is left until he will be "authorized" again to kill Max. Thanks to the information retrieved by Iago, Dr. Mendel located Elementor immediately after the battle in Dark Rival, and taking advantage of his unconsciousness, takes him prisoner to perform new experiments. In an effort to synthesize Morphosos Crystals, Dr. Mendel uses fragments recovered from Extroyer's body partially contaminated with Troy Winter's DNA. As a result, creates an Extroyer clone instead by accident. Taking his opportunity while Max is busy fighting Elementor, the clone absorbs the comet fragment into his body, and becomes a giant monster. Despite the fact he is currently in "evil mode", Cytro makes one last supreme effort to stop him and reverts the effect of the crystals, causing an explosion which reduces both to smithereens.
