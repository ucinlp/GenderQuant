The film follows the story of a group of rude and obnoxious seniors from Fairmont High, an Ohio high school. After a typing class, the seniors cut school and throw a party at the home of Principal Moss . When he returns home, he gives the class detention, forcing them to write a letter to the President of the United States, explaining what is wrong with the education system. Amazingly, the President enjoys it, and invites the class to Washington to discuss it. However, it is actually just a plot devised by a corrupt U.S. Senator to humiliate the President. Upon their journey, the class stops in a convenience store where Mark "Dags" D'Agastino  and Reggie Barry ([[Rob Moore  lock Principal Moss in a flooded convenience store toilet so they can steal alcohol from the store. They are followed by Travis , a crazed Star Trek fan and crossing guard, who hitches a ride with an Asian family. While on their way, Principal Moss falls into a "coma" after taking pills given to him by Red , the bus driver and "Dope King". At this point, the students go on a rampage and throw another party, while Carla Morgan , the school slut, puts makeup on the sleeping Principal Moss. The next morning, the bus is pursued by both Travis and the police. Red suddenly dies, apparently from a drug overdose, and the bus nearly plows into a lake. Dags manages to stop it in time, but Travis's ride is not so lucky. In the confusion, Travis escapes. Arriving at Washington, a class photo taken at a cemetery goes wrong when Miosky ([[Eric Edwards  blows out Edgar Hoover's flame via fart lighting, catching Travis on fire in the process. That night, the seniors secretly lace a box of chocolates with tequila and give it to Miss Milford , subsequently leaving and going to a party at a hotel while Miss Milford seduces Principal Moss in a drunken stupor. In the process, Lisa Perkins , discovers the plot to use the students to embarrass the President. When Principal Moss and Miss Milford find the missing students the next morning, they are informed of the plot. The senator's agents subsequently kidnap Miosky and take him to the White House with the others in hot pursuit. When they arrive at the White House, the senator insults the seniors, but Principal Moss unexpectedly stands up for them. The senator's plot is ultimately exposed, and the seniors go home. The film ends with a montage of the characters and where they ended up after the events of the film.
