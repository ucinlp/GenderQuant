Based on an original play by Bruce Walker, the film tells of the exploits of 16-year-old delinquent youth Roy Walsh  and his gang in post-World War II London. The gang starts off by mugging women. Later, Roy becomes infatuated with Rene, the sister of one of the gang members. Already having a boyfriend, Brian, she rejects Roy, to his fury. Later the gang beat up Brian. Roy menaces Rene, who eventually submits to him. When she informs him that he has made her pregnant, and urges him to marry her, he decides he wants nothing more to do with her. Roy's mother, Elsie Walsh , is involved with Canadian Bob Stevens , who urges her to marry him so he can take Roy "in hand" before it's too late. Roy hates Bob. Bob works as an assistant manager at the Palidrome dance hall, which becomes a target for the gang. Another member of staff appears on the scene, and is shot and wounded by the gang. Later that night a mob of women arrive on the doorstep with Rene's mother, who adds that the police are on their way. Bob arrives, removes Rene's mother from the premises and decides to give Roy a thrashing - for his own good - before the police arrive in the belief that if the judge hears he has already received a thrashing, his sentence might be lighter, which will be easier for his mother to stomach. The police arrive just as Bob is brandishing his belt in readiness. Bob lets them in, and they ask who he is. He tells him he is the boy's stepfather, as "his mother and I were married this morning". The leading officer congratulates him, then, seeing the belt in his hand, smiles, and suggests to his colleague that they go and arrest the other gang member first and come back for Roy later. Bob begins thrashing Roy as the scene cuts to outside and the mob of women listening to Roy's cries and shrieks for help. The detectives then walk away, into the night.
