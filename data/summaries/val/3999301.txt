Forensic entomologist John McGregor 's chimpanzee attendant Inga ([[Tanga  finds her and leads her to him. Witnessing her apparent interaction with his insects, McGregor comes to believe she has a special gift for telepathy with them. Following an ilicit tryst the same night, Sophie is murdered. When other students taunt Jennifer for her connection to insects, she summons a swarm of flies which covers the entire building, then faints. Convinced that Jennifer is insane and possibly responsible for the killings, the headmistress arranges for her to be transferred to a mental hospital for the criminally insane. Jennifer flees to McGregor's home just in time to evade the transfer. McGregor gives to Jennifer a glass case with a Great Sarcophagus fly, which is drawn to decaying human flesh, and suggests she use it to help track the murderer. Later that night, McGregor is murdered in his home after Inga is distracted and locked outside. With nowhere left to go, Jennifer calls her father's lawyer Morris Shapiro for help. He alerts Brückner, who finds Jennifer and offers the girl to stay at her house overnight. Once there Brückner whacks Jennifer unconscious with a piece of wood and incarcerates her in the house. Jennifer engineers her escape through a large hole in the floor that leads through a tunnel to a dungeon and in the basement, she finds Brückner's son, Patua , with a hideously deformed face. He chases Jennifer onto a motorboat and attempts to kill her, but she summons a swarm of flies that attack him. Brückner exposes that her son was the one killing the school girls and that she killed McGregor to try to stop the girl's investigation. Suddenly McGregor's chimpanzee Inga attacks Brückner and kills her with a razor.
