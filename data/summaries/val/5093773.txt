It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown is composed of several Christmas-themed story lines, all taken directly from the Peanuts comic strip.{{Cite web}}: * Charlie Brown tries to sell wreaths door-to-door. * Peppermint Patty worries about her Christmas book report. * Peppermint Patty and Marcie attend a performance of George Frideric Handel's Messiah. * Snoopy becomes a Santa on the street, Lucy and Sally begs to differ. * Woodstock and his bird friends play chamber music inside a snowman's hat. * Charlie Brown tries to explain the true meaning of Christmas to Sally  when she is writing a letter to Santa, but she tunes them out. She also writes to Mrs. Claus, Mary Christmas. * Snoopy, Woodstock and his friends dance with the candy canes that were on Charlie Brown's tree. * Sally goes to Linus's house for the meaning of Christmas and complains to Linus about calling birds in the 12 Days of Christmas song. Linus tells Sally about Albert Schweitzer and how he disliked Christmas presents because he "hated to write thank-you notes." Sally asks who was Albert Schweitzer. * Charlie Brown sells his entire comic book collection in order to buy Peggy Jean a nice pair of gloves, only to find that she has already bought a pair. * The children participate in a Christmas play, where Marcie plays The Virgin Mary, Franklin gets the role of Gabriel, Peppermint Patty reluctantly plays a sheep, and Sally, who has to say the line "Hark!" in the same play to summon a herald angel, inadvertently yelled "Hockey stick!". Later, Harold  Angel drops by to visit Charlie Brown, looking for Sally. In the final scene, Lucy tells Linus to get up from the beanbag, but Linus refuses, saying that they remembered the time when they opened presents under the Christmas tree, and thinking that why they haven't been nice all day. Lucy angrily tells him that he's driving her crazy. The film ends with Linus saying, "Joy to the World".
