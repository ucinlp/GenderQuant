{{Plot}} On Thursday, February 18, in Gamut Hall, the gang participates  in a boring play entitled The Gladiator's Dilemma (a weak adaptation of the novel [[Quo Vadis . The play  is written like a Shakespearean play, using words of older English and creating silly  expressions like "What ho!" The play is written, produced, and directed by Mrs. Funston Evergreen Kennedy. Her husband, Officer Kennedy, is responsible for the special effects and is forced to play different characters, including the giant named Ursus and an elephant. As a nervous, uptight Mrs. Kennedy gives her introduction to the audience, the kids get ready for their performance. Their disgust and lack of enthusiasm show how they feel about the show. During the first act, Mary Ann  and Wheezer forget a good bit of their lines and confuse some of the words for others, so Mrs. Kennedy has to yell them out to them. In the background, a tall boy who plays Ursus sneezes, causing his fake wig and beard to fall and land on Pete the Pup. Mrs. Kennedy helps Chubby start with his line and then excitedly forces her husband to shake the tin to create thundering noises. When Farina  begins saying his line, a goat runs loose and butts him, knocking him down. Getting up, Farina yells, "Forsooth, I think these mountains are full of too many goats!" At the end of Act I, Chubby gets ready to play Nero. He looks at the script and begins writing his lines on his costume in case he forgets a line. Mr. Kennedy luckily notices that he was wearing his costume inside out and has him put it on correctly. At the beginning of Act II, Jackie delivers his lines and  forgets several words, so Mrs. Kennedy yells them to him, getting more and more nervous. Donald Haines catches the giggles while saying his line about Nero riding an "elephant bathed in perfume." Just minutes later after Kennedy comes onstage in an elephant costume , the curtain accidentally falls in the middle of he scene, causing the elephant head to fall off. The boy in charge of opening and closing the curtains just sits, so Mrs. Kennedy has to open them up for him. Chubby accidentally falls on a bowl of tomatoes, and the juice leaves his rear end wet and dirty. Meanwhile, some teenaged boys  are seeking revenge by throwing eggs at the players. Chubby forgets a line and has to pull his toga up to find out what his next line is . His mother and Mrs. Kennedy order him to put it back down, so he asks quietly what he must say. After being given the line, he says, "What ho! Bring on the dancing girls!" A female dancer comes onstage to do her number while the musicians play a sour-note version of "The Blue Danube Waltz.". The angry boys find the dance number terrible and throw an egg at her face. As Farina does his scene, wherein he reads the future from a crystal ball, he confuses some words for others, so Mrs. Kennedy again has to yell out the right words. After a while, he gets disgusted and aggravated with her yelling, and he yells out for the audience to hear, "Doggone it! Look, I wish that woman would quit bothering me!" The audience chuckles, and Farina resumes his performance by beginning his next line with "Well, anyway..." Chubby suddenly gets an egg thrown in his face, while Farina gets one at his right ear. Mrs. Kennedy, who is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, begins biting at her script. At the beginning of Act III, "Mary Annicus" is told that Nero wants to marry her. Before she is able to show that she forgot her line, Mrs. Kennedy gives it to her: "I spurn thy vile heart, O monster, and cast it in the dust." Mary Ann, refusing to go through all that, just shortens the line: "Well anyway, I won't marry ya." Farina gets a second egg in the face, and the fight that he must have with the lion turns into a comedic act. The scenes with the sacred bull are even funnier when the man in the bull costume runs around and dances. Kennedy comes out onstage to play Ursus the Giant, who has to kill the "bullicus." When the man inside the bull costume provokes Kennedy by making the bull stand on just its hind legs, Kennedy takes off his beard and hair and fights the man inside the bull costume with his bare fists. By now, Mrs. Kennedy is about to break down and cry. Soon, Kennedy gets a pie in the face from one of the teenaged boys. While saying his line, Chubby ends up getting a pie thrown at him from one of the boys. His mother catches the boy in the act of throwing the pie and encourages Chubby to throw a pie back at the boy. Chubby tries but misses. The man who was hit tries to hit Chubby but ends up hitting one of the other boys, and the boy's father tries to hit that man but misses. Chubby tries to hit another person who hit him with a pie but ends up hitting his own mother. Soon, a pie fight begins with everyone in the auditorium participating. Mrs. Kennedy sees the play being completely ruined and orders everyone to stop. The kids turn to Kennedy. He nods, giving them permission, and all the kids throw their pies at her.
