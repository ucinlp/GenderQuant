The plot takes place in the small town of Tešanj in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, two years after the Bosnian War. The town is overridden by corruption, prostitution and organized crime. People of Tešanj live in peace, though the war scars are visible everywhere in town, as well as in people's souls. The population of Tešanj are almost exclusively ethnic Bosniaks. Ethnic Serbs live in surrounding villages. It is announced that U.S. president Bill Clinton will pay a visit to the town. Western bureaucrats arrive to Tešanj to supervise the preparations for the visit. Everything in the town must be in order, including the faked brotherhood between Bosniaks and Serbs.
