The film centers on a heartbroken lovebird's decision to commit suicide after his marriage goes sour. He recruits a black cat  to eat him, but the suspicious cat thinks the bird is poison and refuses. For the rest of the film, the lovebird attempts to get Sylvester to eat him by persuasion, bribery, and force. The gag of a character wanting to be eaten and the cat refusing to is later repeated in the Hubie and Bertie cartoon Cheese Chasers. But the cartoon ends with the bird showing Sylvester lots of food from a cook book along with a radio . The bird manages to convince him to eat him but before that moment, he got a telegram that said that his wife left him and he told Sylvester that he doesn't have to eat him. But before you know it, he changed his mind not to eat him, the bird manages to escape and get back home but when he closed the door, she changed her mind and the bird then wanted to commit suicide again, while looking for the cat on every window.
