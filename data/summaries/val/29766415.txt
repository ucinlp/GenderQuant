One evening while eagerly awaiting a date with Daisy, Donald Duck realizes he doesn't have any money. "I'm financially embarrassed!" he moans while pondering what to do. Then he sees Huey, Duey, and Louie's piggy bank, and following a brief battle with his conscience, takes it. After sending the nephews to bed Donald breaks open the piggy bank, takes the money , and goes on to have a wonderful time with Daisy. Later that evening Donald drops Daisy off at her house. She kisses him and calls him a "big shot." As Donald starts walking home, his conscience tells him "Yes sir, she thinks you're a 'big shot!' You probably look like a millionaire to her... but you're NOT!" His conscience then points out that bank robbery is a federal offense. Donald starts to feel guilty for having stolen the money and starts to run, imagining that federal agents are chasing him. As the film continues his visions become even more disturbed and nightmarish. At last Donald corners himself in a dark alley and thinks he is in jail. He frantically grabs the bars of a door window and shakes it. "Let me out of here! Let me out!" A sign falls off and hits him in the head. It's a 'help wanted' sign, and Donald discovers the door is just the service entrance of an all night cafe. Donald works through the night and pays the boys back, "and a nickel besides." However, when the nephews wake up, they see Donald trying to take the extra nickel from the rebuilt piggy bank and think he is stealing. Donald's conscience says "You see, chum? Crime doesn't pay."
