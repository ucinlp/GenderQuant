Five teenagers and a teacher go on a two-week trek through the Cascade Mountains. At first, they had a great time; making new friends and enjoying the wild. They then go to Eagle Rock where Mr.B ([[Matt McCoy  tells about his life in the woods, which refers to the Gary Paulsen book, Hatchet. When they are on top of Eagle Rock, Mr. B falls in the woods, so the teenagers set off on a journey to find him. When they find him, they help him recover from the fall. It ends with the teenagers finding rescue helicopters and returning home safely. Only two of them had really seen the white wolf but never told Mr. B.
