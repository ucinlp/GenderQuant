Posing as mother and daughter, two professional thieves - middle-aged alcoholic Chewing Gum  and trashy-sexy cat burglar Anycall  - rob the wealthy owner of Leesung Gallery  of a rare artifact he bought from notorious Chinese fence Wei Hong . The theft is organized by team leader Popeye , helped by his associate Jampano . The next day they are visited by a police detective  who is hot on Popeye's trail. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong Chinese veteran thief Chen , along with Johnny  and Korean-Chinese Andrew , are busy robbing a jewelry shop. Afterwards, they're joined by Julie , the daughter of a professional safecracker. To escape the heat at home, the Koreans join Chen's gang in Hong Kong for a heist led by South Korean master thief Macau Park , who was once Popeye's boss. Park's plan is to steal the Tear of the Sun diamond, worth US$30 million, which was stolen during an exhibition in Tokyo by Japanese thief Madame Tiffany , mistress of Wei Hong, who is coming to sell it in Macau. Popeye has brought along safecracker Pepsi , just released on parole, but Park is unhappy with her joining the team, as they once had a relationship that ended badly four years ago. Park intends to sell the diamond back to Wei Hong for US$20 million - a risky venture as Wei Hong, whose face has rarely been seen, has a habit of murdering anyone who crosses him. Everyone in the team of thieves has a separate agenda and, when the robbery finally takes place in Macau, little goes according to plan.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}{{cite web}}
