He runs a destitute camp for these children, assisted by Evelyn  who looks upon the Doc as a great man. Mickey Rooney is Jimmy, a paraplegic kid whom the Doc promises to cure. This little triangle is interrupted by rich girl Joan who cons the good Doc into building a sanitorium for the wealthy with her father's money.

His treatment of Jimmy pays off as Jimmy rides a bicycle to save the day. Doc realizes that his true love is Evelyn, not the self-interested Joan.
