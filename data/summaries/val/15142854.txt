{{Plot}} Early in "Like Water for Chocolate", the audience learns that the protagonist, Tita, is forbidden to marry because of a family tradition. Therefore, when the boy she has been flirting with, Pedro, and his father come to ask for Tita’s hand in marriage, Tita's mother, Mama Elena, refuses. Mama Elena offers her other daughter, Rosaura, and Pedro accepts in order to be closer to Tita. Tita bakes the wedding cake with tears causing vomiting, crying, and a longing for their true love in all those who eat it. Mama Elena goes to look at a photo of a man who is later revealed to be her other daughter Gertrudis's true father, news which kills Mama Elena's husband. A year passes and Tita puts her feelings for Pedro in a meal of rose petals. Tita's heat and passion transfers to Gertrudis upon eating the meal. She attempts to cool down by taking a shower, but is overcome with lust and runs off naked with revolutionary soldiers. Rosaura gives birth to a baby boy, but Tita is the one, who through Pedro's gaze, is able to nurse the child. Mama Elena is suspicious of Tita's intentions, and sends Rosaura and Pedro away. Tita blames the succeeding death of the baby on Elena and is then secluded in a dovecote entering a catatonic like state. Dr. John Brown takes Tita away to care for her in Texas. He tells her an ancient story which says that all humans are born with enough matches to burn like a candle. But to set off this fire, every person must find their own trigger. They must also be careful to not set off all their internal matches at once, or risk immolation. Tita eventually enters into a relationship with Dr. Brown after recovering, and reluctantly plans to marry him. Mama Elena is attacked and killed by revolutionaries, so Rosaura and Pedro return for the funeral. Rosaura soon gives birth to a second child, Esperanza. Soon after, Dr. Brown is called away and Pedro and Tita succumb to their emotions and sleep together. Mama Elena returns to haunt Tita, convincing her that she is pregnant with Pedro's child. That night, Gertrudis returns to the ranch as a general with her revolutionary husband. She helps Tita banish Mama Elena and realize it was an imaginary pregnancy. Upon Dr. Brown's return, Tita tells him that she slept with another man and he reluctantly allows her to break their engagement. Twenty years pass, and the audience learns that Rosaura died of "severe digestive problems". Pedro confesses to Tita that he still loves her, and wants to marry her. Tita and Pedro then make love, igniting their "matches" or passions too quickly, killing Pedro just as he has a sensuous orgasm. Tita then swallows matches, lighting the entire ranch on fire in the process. Rosaura's daughter returns to the ranch and finds only Tita’s cookbook, which contained her recipes and told of her and Pedro’s love story.
