The film follows Vincent Dooly , an aspiring inventor who dreams of winning the Thomas Alva Edison Award for Young Inventors . Each year, he enters and each year he humiliates himself with an invention that malfunctions in one way or another. A documentary crew follows Vincent in the last year that he is eligible to compete for the award, at the same time following Martin Wooderson , a smug wunderkind with a long history of winning the award with dull but marketable inventions. Through the months leading up to the Eddy's, Vincent mentions  an invention he is working on that he is sure will change his losing streak but refuses to reveal more. We meet Vincent's best friend Gunter , his endlessly supportive mother , his tweaked-out father , the object of his affection  and his hero, a surly junkyard worker . As the story moves along we see Vincent's attempt at perfecting his many inventions and see him emotionally prepare for his last chance to win the coveted award while attempting to win the heart of Jenny , a waitress at the local diner he frequents. The film culminates at the award ceremony where Vincent and Martin unveil their final inventions and vie for the prize. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1274589/plotsummary
