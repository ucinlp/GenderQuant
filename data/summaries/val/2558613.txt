In 1965, after provoking a fire in a forest, the rebel teenager Heather Fasulo  is sent to the boarding school Falburn Academy in the middle of the woods by her estranged mother Alice Fasulo  and her neglected father Joe Fasulo . The dean Ms. Traverse  accepts Heather in spite of the bad financial condition of her father. The displaced Heather becomes close friend of her weird Marcy Turner , while they are maltreated by the abusive mate Samantha Wise ([[Rachel Nichols . During the nights, Heather has nightmares and listens to voices from the woods, and along the days she believes that the school is a coven of witches. When some students, including Marcy and Ann Whales , simply vanish, Heather believes that to avoid being the next to disappear she has no choice but to investigate and, if possible, get out of that place. At the end of the movie, it states that fictional Fallburn Academy burned to the ground in 1965, while the trees were strangely left untouched.
