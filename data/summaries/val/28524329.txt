Michel Durand is a psychoanalyst who is in the habit of dropping off to sleep while listening to his patients. At the end of one session Madame Kubler does not move. What has happened? Who killed the wife of Max Kubler, the crooked property developer? Why are Michel Durand's arms hurting so much ? Can you murder someone while asleep? Michel Durand needs to do something in any case, because Police Commissioner Chapireau is investigating and Max Kubler is going crazy looking for his wife.Synopsis, p.200 Phil Powrie, Beineix , Manchester University Press 2001
