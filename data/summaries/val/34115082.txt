That night, as Kate predicted, Jason died and that last moment before he dies, he saw a horrible image. Days later, Kate receives a "reincarnation" phone call. Frightened, she follows the phone caller's instruction and leaves from Los Angeles to Hong Kong and there she meets Daren. Daren is a bartender, because he has an "incomplete spirit", he feels depressed. Darren and Kate investigate about the journey of reincarnation and found out the truth of the horrible image that Jason saw before his death.
