In it, Ossorio introduces the concept that the Knights Templar  come back from the dead as zombie-like revenants. Their blindness is explained as the result of their eyes having been pecked out by birds after their hanged bodies were left on the gallows. The story follows a couple who run into an old friend on vacation. The man invites the woman along for a train trip, but his girlfriend  jumps off the train and ends up spending the night in the ruins where the Templars are buried. The Templars wake up from the trance and kill her. The rest of the movie follows the efforts by the victim's boyfriend and girlfriend to find out what happened. The film is notable for the slow, creepy atmosphere it maintains throughout. The zombie Knights Templar are blind and hunt by sound, leading to several sequences where characters are attempting to be as quiet as possible so as not to be found and killed. Although the Knights are identifiable by their uniforms, they are never called "Templars" in the movie; they are referred to as "Knights from the East." Ossorio objected to the description of the living dead Templars as "zombies," insisting that they more resembled mummies and that, unlike zombies, the Templars were not mindless corpses.
