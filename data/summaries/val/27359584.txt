{{Plot}} The movie begins on a White Star Line chartered boat train, boarding passengers to the RMS Titanic. A poor girl named Angelica, treated as a servant by her wicked stepmother and two stepsisters, dreams of finding both love and her missing mother, with only a blue locket as a clue to the mother's identity. At the same time, an upper-class English boy named William boards with his Nanny &nbsp;– who laments the loss of her daughter years ago&nbsp;– and his secretary Gaston. Other passengers include the gold-digging Winnie, a failing banker named Jeremy McFlannel, a jewel thief named Corynthia Meanstreak, her two henchmen Kirk and Dirk, a detective named Sam Bradbury who has been sent to pursue them and is visually based on Sherlock Holmes, and Molly, a gorgeous singer. Also boarding in the cargo hold are a group of animals, including a family of Yiddish mice, some geese, a dog named Fritz, a magpie named Hector, and a band of Mexican Mice. After Fritz saves the mice from a cat he begins rapping on an unrelated topic about having fun. Throughout the voyage, the various passengers meet and interact. William and Angelica fall in love at first sight in a corridor while Winnie and Jeremy fall for each other after Winnie's dog Flopsy trips him. Gaston meanwhile attempts to woo Molly with Angelica's locket, which he found after she unknowingly dropped it. Sam goes undercover to find Cornynthia while Kirk and Dirk make several unsuccessful attempts to steal jewelry from Winnie, but are foiled by her dog. The film reaches its climax at a reception held in the honor of the passengers. Angelica is able to attend with William, after her cabinmate Victoria loans her a suitable dress. Meanwhile, the Yiddish mouse child Maxie discovers that Angelica is missing her locket and recruits the other animals to help search for it, finding it in time for her to wear to the reception. Upon seeing the locket being worn by Angelica and hearing the  implication from one of the ship's officers that it was stolen when she received it, Molly promptly slaps Gaston and leaves him. When Gertrude, Bernice and Hortense attempt to break up Angelica and William, Maxie scares them off. Kirk and Dirk manage to successfully steal a pearl choker from Winnie, but learn that it is a fake&nbsp;– Winnie is not in fact rich and uses fake jewelry to lure in rich men. The Titanic hits the iceberg and begins to sink as the passengers rush for the lifeboats. All of the animals escape on floating crates, rescuing the ship's cook in the process and being led to safety by dolphins. Winnie chooses to stay behind with Jeremy, who reveals to her that he is not the rich man she thought he was&nbsp;– he was on his way to America to be bailed out after his bank failed. Despite learning this, Winnie still loves him and they die together. Molly also chooses to remain behind on the ship, singing with the band and dies along with them. On one of the lifeboats, Angelica discovers that William's Nanny is actually her mother and the two are reunited. After the ship goes down they search for William, rescuing Sam from the water in the process. Eventually, William is rescued and reunited with Angelica. An epilogue reveals that the two were married and lived "happily ever after". The epilogue also portrayed Detective Sam Bradbury  as a parody of Kojak as he was seen as a bald man holding a lollipop . Corynthia's henchmen, Kirk and Dirk, married Angelica's foster sisters, who believed their husbands to be wealthy. William's secretary, Gaston, married a wealthy socialite hoping to live off her money but ended up in charge of her home's household chores.
