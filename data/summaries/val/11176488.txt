My Name Is Anthony Gonsalves starts with a gangster and killer, Sikander , murdering someone with his gang; they bury him and flee. Then the story line drops to a young man, Anthony Gonsalves , who accepts Sikander for his father, guru, everything, since Sikander adopted Anthony when he was a young child living on the streets. He didn't exactly adopt him, since he says that his real father is the town priest . Anthony's big dream is to become a famous and wealthy actor and be as kind as Sikander&mdash;he doesn't know that Sikander is a murderer. Sikander never told him because he wanted Anthony to be a kind and nice gentleman, unlike himself.
