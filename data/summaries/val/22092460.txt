A group of terrorists led by Commander Topov  kidnap the Russian prime minister's son and daughter and hold them hostage, demanding the release of their comrades within 72 hours. In addition, they have taken over the crippled Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant and threaten to detonate it if their demands are not met. It is revealed that among the ranks of the terrorists is a Next-Generation UniSol  , who was smuggled in by rogue scientist Dr. Colin . U.S. forces bring in troops at the plant, but quickly retreat when the four UniSols revived for this mission are systematically eliminated by the NGU. Meanwhile, former UniSol Luc Deveraux , who is suffering being rehabilitated in Switzerland by Dr. Sandra Fleming  to rejoin society, is taken back by the military to participate in the mission. As the deadline nears its expiration, the prime minister announces the release of 110 prisoners. The terrorists rejoice and shut off their bomb. Dr. Colin, however, is not pleased with the outcome, as he feels his side of the business is not done. As the NGU is programmed not to harm the terrorists, Dr. Colin unleashes his second UniSol: a cloned and upgraded version of Andrew Scott  - Deveraux's former nemesis, who quickly kills Commander Topov. Unfortunately, Dr. Colin never considered the mental instability of Scott, and he is immediately killed by his own creation. Scott then reactivates the bomb before heading out to hunt the children. In the midst of the chaos, Capt. Kevin Burke ([[Mike Pyle  is sent in to infiltrate the plant and rescue the prime minister's children. He is successful in locating them and decides to lead them out of the building. On their way out, they encounter the NGU. The children flee for safety as Burke tries in vain to hold off the NGU, who stabs him to death after a short but brutal struggle. With 30 minutes remaining, Deveraux is geared up and sent to the plant, where he kills every terrorist in sight. He searches the buildings further and sees the children cornered by Scott. Before Scott gets a chance to kill the children, Deveraux attacks him, and a grueling fight ensues. In the end, Deveraux impales Scott on the forehead with a lead pipe and fires a shotgun through it, blowing his brains out. As Deveraux escorts the children to safety, they are attacked by the NGU. Deveraux and the NGU take the fight to the site of the bomb, with less than two minutes remaining. During the melee, Deveraux removes the detonator and jams it in the back of the NGU's uniform as they both jump out the reactor chamber. NGU pulls the detonator off his back, but it is too late, as it explodes, taking him with it. U.S. soldiers quickly arrive on the scene and tend to the children as Deveraux runs away. Meanwhile, Burke's body is placed in a black bag and taken away, as well as pieces of the NGU being collected. Back in Langley, Virginia, Burke's body is stored in a cryogenic chamber as a new UniSol, along with multiple clones made of him.
