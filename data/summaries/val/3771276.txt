In 1960, in the sleepy mining town of Valentine Bluffs, a methane gas explosion at Hanniger Coal Mine trapped five miners in a shaft when the foremen of the crew left early to attend the town's Valentine's Day dance. Six weeks later, the sole survivor of the accident, Harry Warden, was rescued; he survived by eating his dead coworkers and ultimately went mad. After a year in a mental institution, he escaped on Valentine's Day, killing and cutting out the heart of the guilty foreman, leaving a warning that the same would happen if the town ever again held a Valentine's Day celebration. With the legend of Harry Warden nothing but a distant memory, a group of young miners and their girlfriends decide that the town has gone without a party long enough. As the night of the dance approaches, a murderous maniac in mining gear begins dispatching townsfolk in bloody and creative ways. The town sheriff and mayor quickly deduce it must be Harry Warden, who was returned to the institution, though their attempts to confirm Warden's status are hindered. Despite the murders, the young adults continue with their plans for a dance, laughing off the "stories" of the murderous Harry Warden. Finally the night of the dance is reached and as the Miner dispatches off several partiers, a group decides to venture into the mines to explore and impress the women. Realizing that a killer is on the loose, a rescue party composed of best friends T.J. and Axel go after the others and Sarah, who both men love. The Miner has indeed followed them into the mine, killing most of the group, Happy was pick axed through his neck through his eyes, and dragged him, later on he also kills John by putting his head on the hot pot, and Sylvia who was hanged on the pipe using her head, Dave and Harriet, impaling them. Hollis saw Dave and Harriet's body and he was killed using the nail Gun and he falls off on the front of the group, forcing Howard, T.J., Axel, Sarah and Patty to try to escape. Howard makes his own way and separates to the group, He was killed at the top, his head was tied with a rope, and forced to be dragged down, separating his head from the body while the group climbs up on the ladder making his body fall on the Ground, Patty screams and the group was forced again down to the mine, Axel appears to be killed  then T.J was separated from the two girls, While Sarah and Patty searching for the exit, Patty is murdered with an pick axe. Sarah stumbles and runs, until T.J founds her. On the surface the Mayor and Sheriff find out that Harry Warden died 5 years ago and are preparing to lead a group of men into the mines. In the mine, the Miner attacks T.J. and Sarah on a moving rail line and the fight eventually is forced into an abandoned shaft where the integrity of the ceiling is in doubt. The Miner is revealed to be in fact not Warden, but Axel. A flashback reveals that he witnessed the murder of his father, one of the foremen, by Harry Warden when he was a boy. The ceiling then collapses, burying Axel alive. Only his arm is visible, but as rescue efforts are taken it is soon discovered that Axel has cut off his own arm to escape. Through the hole in the wall, T.J., Sarah and the police watch as the deranged and delusional Axel tells T.J. that he will be waiting in Hell for him. Axel runs deeper into the mine calling out to Harry Warden, telling him that he is coming. He warns them that he and Harry will be coming back and asks Sarah to be his "Bloody Valentine". The film ends as Axel runs deeper into the mine singing "Daddy gone away, Harry Warden made you pay" to himself. The screen fades to black and the audience can hear the sound of Harry Warden laughing, but he stops as the credits roll.
