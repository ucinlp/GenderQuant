Joffa Corfe and Shane McRae star as a couple of knockabout handymen with a passion for the Collingwood Football Club. The pair have a knack for attracting trouble which drives the local priest Father Bob McGuire to the point of despair. {{cite web}} The film portrays Joffa; an ordinary man. The fact he attracts the affection of thousands and the hatred of tens of thousands is just how it is for the man who guides the Collingwood Cheer Squad. Joffa said that the ordinary people who inhabit his real world "give the movie its heart."  The Australian Council on Children and the Media  said that the main messages from this movie are: "Working together as a team is what wins the game."
