In 1931 Hugo Cabret  is a 12-year-old boy living in the walls of the Paris Gare Montparnasse railway station, tending to the station's clocks. Previously, he was raised by his widowed father, a museum worker . His father had died in a museum fire, but prior to that, he had doted on Hugo, taking him to movies and showing him how he was repairing a mechanical man automaton that supposedly could write a message. Following his father's death, Hugo was taken by his alcoholic uncle Claude  who showed little sentiment for Hugo but taught the boy how to maintain the clocks at the station. When Claude disappears, Hugo continues to maintain the clocks while seeking out a living by stealing food and supplies, fearing that if the vigilant Station Inspector  were to discover Hugo, he would be turned over to an orphanage. Hugo continues the work on the automaton from his father's notebook, stealing what supplies he can from the passengers and storeclerks in the station. One day, he is caught by a bitter toymaker, Papa Georges . Georges confiscates Hugo's father's notebook, and Hugo is forced to trail Georges to his home to retrieve it. There, he meets Georges' goddaughter, Isabelle , who promises to help. The next day, Georges gives some ashes to Hugo, referring them as remains of the notebook but Isabelle tells him that it was not burnt. Finally, Georges lets Hugo earn his notebook back if he works for him every day to pay for all the items Hugo stole. During his free time, Hugo continues to work on the automaton. When it is finished, however, it is still missing one part; a heart-shaped key that goes into the back of the automaton to make it work. As the two grow close together, Hugo takes Isabelle to the movies, something that Georges would never let her do, while she introduces him to a bookstore owner  who has loaned her books in the past.  Hugo eventually takes Isabelle to see the automaton. Hugo is surprised to find that Isabelle wears that key as a necklace as a gift from Georges. They start up the automaton, and watch as it draws out an iconic scene from the film Voyage to the Moon by the film pioneer Georges Méliès. When the automaton writes a signature, Isabelle recognizes the handwriting as her godfather's own. They take the drawing to Georges' home for an explanation. They ask Isabelle's godmother Mama Jeanne  but she will not tell them anything. As Georges arrives home, Jeanne forces the children into a back room, where they find a hidden compartment in an armoire with many more drawings of Méliès' films. The noise draws Georges in, and he throws Hugo out, feeling betrayed. Some time later, Hugo and Isabelle discuss Méliès with the bookstore owner; he directs them to a book on the history of film. As they read the book, its author, Rene Tabard , appears and shares his common love for Méliès's work; though his book claims that Méliès died during World War I, but the two convince Tabard that the filmmaker is still alive. Tabard reveals he has the last known copy of Voyage, and Hugo suggests that they go to the Georges' house to watch it the next evening. That night, Hugo has a dream where he finds the heart-shaped key but is run over by an approaching train and ends with the sequence of the Gare Montparnasse accident. The next evening, Jeanne is hesitant about letting them show the film until Tabard recognizes her as Jeanne d'Alcy, a frequent and beautiful actress in many of Méliès' films. When the film finishes, Georges comes out, and emotionally reveals himself to be Méliès, recalling his filmmaking career. He transformed his illusionist skills into the special effects he used for his movies to bring his vivid imagination to life. However, with the onset of World War I, his films lost popularity with a war-weary population, and he became ruined, selling the films to be melted down to chemicals and quietly disappeared as a toy maker to sustain himself and Jeanne. Georges is despondent, believing all of his former film materials were otherwise destroyed in a museum fire, leading Hugo to recall the automaton. Hugo races back to the station to get the automaton , but before he can retrieve it, he is discovered by the Station Inspector and reveals that Claude's body had been discovered in the River Seine, and the Inspector now knows Hugo is an orphan. During the chase, Hugo climbs up the clock tower and is forced to climb onto the clock hands to hide from the Inspector. When he goes away, Hugo quickly climbs back in and gets the automaton but is quickly cornered again by the Inspector and the automaton is thrown onto the railway tracks. Despite the approach of an oncoming train, Hugo jumps onto the tracks to recover the automaton. With no time to climb back up onto the platform to save himself and the automaton, Hugo appears to face certain death from the oncoming train. However, the Inspector saves Hugo at the last moment. As the Inspector decides whether or not to arrest Hugo, Georges arrives and asserts that Hugo is now in his care. Hugo presents the automaton to Georges. Sometime later, a film festival is held showcasing over eighty recovered and restored Méliès films. Georges tearfully takes the stage, and thanks Hugo for his dedication and to the other attendees for sharing his imagination with him. After the festival, in the Georges' house, Hugo has acclimated as Georges' son, while Isabelle begins writing a book on the recent events. The film ends on a shot of the automaton sitting in a room.
