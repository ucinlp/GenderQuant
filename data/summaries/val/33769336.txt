The plot is around two couples. One pair is Perugorría and Spanish actress Cuca Escribano; the other is Cruz and Gabriela Griffith. Film takes place inland on fresh water, a great opportunity to meditate about the human being and its complexities, facing emptiness and the lack of rational explanation for many of the problems of the contemporary world, sometimes appearing that the only way out is to take refuge in instincts and sex. But the result is ephemeral and the attempt has unforeseeable consequences.Repeating Islands: Afinidades, New Film by Vladimir Cruz and Jorge Perugorría
