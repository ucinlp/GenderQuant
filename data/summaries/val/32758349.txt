In desperation, Tachi planned to join the Zapatista rebels in Mexico. Unfortunately, Tachi was fired from his job, which made him more upset. This prompted him to find a sorcerer to spell a curse to his employer. While looking for a sorcerer at at Sonora Market in Mexico City Tachi met Ehe. The medicine man cautioned him about the dangers of sorcery and he informed the young Mexican about the spiritual tradition of the Aztecs known as Tetzkatlipoka. Tachi forgot his objective to find a sorcerer and joined Ehe to a spiritual journey, discover his roots and learn about the life and ways of a traditional healer.
