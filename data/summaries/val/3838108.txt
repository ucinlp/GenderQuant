The film brims with British comedy talent of the period. The Crazy Gangâ€™s mobile fish and chip shop is accidentally tied to a barrage balloon and the gang is carried to Nazi Germany. They are captured but break out of prison, impersonate Adolf Hitler and return to England in a stolen secret weapon. The film was a morale-booster at a period of the war when Britain looked in real danger of defeat.
