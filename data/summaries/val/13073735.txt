Police detective Ha Chun-Chi  is investigating a rape and murder that took place in a mysterious forest that has also been the scene of many suicides. The main suspect in the murder case is Patrick Wong , but he denies committing the crime. Ha's investigation leads her to botanist Shum Shu-Hoi , who has been experimenting with plants from the forest. Shum's girlfriend, May , feigns interest in the forest to gain information for a tabloid television show she works for. Shum's experiments reveal that the plants can act as witnesses in the murder case, and sets up a re-enactment of the crime in the forest, where the plants will act as lie detectors.
