Lawrence Hammer  and Dean Mazzoli  are two Naval Officers undergoing the rigorous and demanding Navy BUD/s training program. Both men quest to become Navy SEALs. During the training Hammer is shown as cocky and not a true team player. Mazzoli is a natural leader who is respected by the other trainees. The two men clash over time due to Hammer’s attitude making a bad name for everyone. The two men’s feud eventually is seen by the training instructs and after being punished in a “military manner” the two become friends. On liberty Mazzoli takes an interest in Barbara, a known love interest and friend of Hammer’s. Barbara and Mazzoli share a romantic moment under a capsized canoe but Mazzoli breaks away before anything further happens knowing that his friend Hammer is has been “with” her for a while. Later that night Hammer and Barbara elope and Mazzoli is shocked but accepts the marriage. The two finish their BUD/s training and Mazzoli informs Hammer that he is completing his SDV training on the East Coast, not the West Coast as Hammer will be doing. A brief confrontation between the two occurs on the beach and subsides when Mazzoli says it’s because of Barbara. Soon Iraq invades Kuwait and Hammer is seen on a recon mission with Bosco who was Mazzoli’s and Hammer’s former lead training instructor. After coming under enemy fire Bosco is taken prisoner. Hammer and Mazzoli reunite when Mazzoli comes to aid in the rescue mission of Bosco. While preparing for the mission the two catch up with Hammer talking about how Barbara and her son Josh both miss seeing him. He further goes on and tells of his infidelities and about Barbara knowing about his unfaithfulness. Hammer and Mazzoli successfully rescue Boscoe but Hammer is severely injured during the mission. While Hammer is hospitalized, Mazzoli picks up Barbara at the airport to bring her to see her husband. The two exchange a level of awkwardness and it is clear they both have feelings for each other. After ensuring that Hammer is okay, Barbara and Hammer began to argue and we learn that Hammer slept with Barbara’s best friend. While remaining around for Hammer’s sake, Barbara is guided around the area by Mazzoli. They two share some alone time together and their romantic feelings come back with each aware of the other’s feelings. Barbara informs Mazzoli that she will be leaving Hammer. The SEAL commanders inform Hammer while in the hospital that they will be sending the SEALs back in to destroy the island facilities where Boscoe was being held. The island is a chemical weapons manufacturing base. Hammer intends on participating in the mission but is denied for medical reasons. He falsifies paperwork and is released from the hospital. He attends the briefing for the mission and produces his falsified medical clearance which gains him a spot on the mission roster. The mission is launched and Mazzoli learns early on that Hammer wasn’t medically fit for diving. He raises his concern that Hammer put the whole team and mission in jeopardy. The mission is successful but the SEALs are discovered and are on the run. They commandeer a boat and plan on blowing up the boat. Hammer ensures he is the last one off the boat but becomes snagged by netting on his jump off the boat. The boat explodes and Mazzoli is seen searching the water for his friend. He finds Hammer and Hammer tells him “I’m dying” to which Mazzoli responds “You’re always dying.” The Seals are rescue and Hammer is being attended to when he goes into cardiac arrest. Upon the ships return to the docks Barbara is seen waiting and smiles when she sees Mazzoli. The smile turns to grief when she sees a saddened Mazzoli and other SEALs carrying a body bag containing Hammer's corpse off the ship. The movie ends with Mazzoli coming back into narration saying when Barbara and him both lost Hammer, they lost themselves as well, meaning they did not pursue a relationship.
