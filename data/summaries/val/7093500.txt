Phyllis Saroka  is a P.E. teacher at a school in New York City, who reads a flier at her school that Sunset Park High School is looking for a new boys basketball coach. Looking for more money to pursue opening a restaurant, she decides to give the job a shot despite knowing nothing of basketball. She contacts the correct people and is given the job. She shows up for her first day on the and the team is already skeptical of her. When she walks in, one player is heard saying "I know we gon' lose every game." She then lets the players run the team, calling their own fouls, running their own plays, and basically allowing them to be carefree. During a game, she makes some bad decisions which irks some of the players on the team. This inspires her to learn more about the game with the assistance of her players. They help her and the team begins to slowly find success. The team also has to deal with outside forces that threaten the team. Tyrik "Shorty" Russell  is on probation and eventually gets into more trouble. Spaceman  is also on probation, is constantly using drugs, and has trouble with a teacher. Busy-bee  is shot during the season and misses several games. Several other players are having academic trouble and some don't even get along with each other. The team members also find out that the coach only plans to stay with them one season and then leave to open a restaurant. The team eventually comes together despite their differences and troubles. They end up with very successful season, and get into the city championship. They go to Madison Square Garden to face their opponent and lose by a small margin. Afterward, the coach informs them that they should be proud of themselves and that she will return next season.
