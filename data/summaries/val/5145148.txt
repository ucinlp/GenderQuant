Roger Cobb  is now married to Kelly , has a daughter, Laurel , and lives in the old Cobb family house that is located on a deserted and desolate shoreline. Roger's cynical brother-in-law Burke  has been pestering him to sell the family mansion to some seedy Mafia real estate developers, without any success. Roger is soon killed in a car accident that leaves Laurel requiring a wheelchair, and Burke is unable to convince Kelly to sell the house. Various supernatural events start occurring in the house, and after Kelly consults with a native American spiritual guide, she learns that the spirit of Roger and some Indians have been trying to warn Kelly that Roger's tragic car accident was in fact cold-blooded murder and that Burke is trying to sell the land to the Mafia so that it can be used for the illegal dumping of toxic waste.
