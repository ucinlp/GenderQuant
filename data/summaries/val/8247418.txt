Aiyampettai Arivudainambi Kaliyaperumal Chandran   is a playful young man. Upon completion of his degree, his uncle  advises him to attend an interview for a job at his friend Sri Ramachandramurthy's  company. The doctor advises Chandran to act in a manner most appreciated by Sri Ramachandramurthy namely wearing a Nehru kurta, telling his full name always, giving importance to his moustache, showing a lack of interest in sports and drama, giving respect to his father's words  and detesting the concept of recommendations. During the job interview, Chandran followed his uncle's advice perfectly and gets the job along with a beaming smile from his boss. However, Chandran eventually gets caught when Sri Ramachandramurthy watches him at a football match, which he attends with his friends. He took leave on that day by telling his boss that his mother  was in a serious medical condition. To escape from the ire of his boss and being fired, he makes his boss believe that it was his  twin brother Indran  who was at the match and not himself. This idea was inspired by a dual-role played by his actor friend Nagesh in a fictional film where he is in two roles: one with a moustache and one without. Sri Ramachandramurthy  wants to see Chandran's brother Indran as well as his mother and wants Indran to teach music to his daughter Sarojini . Chandran was startled at the request but agreed to it. He seeks his friend Nagesh for help. Nagesh advises Chandran to remove his moustache and go ahead acting as Indran. Chandran was reluctant to remove his moustache but goes ahead with it as there is no other way to continue the drama. The now moustache-less Indran was the anti-thesis of the Chandran as seen by Sri Ramachandramurthy. Indran takes music classes for Sri Ramachandramurthy's daughter Sarojini and the two fall in love. For most of the rest of the film Chandran was leading a dual life: a sincere hardworking employee to his boss and a typical cool young guy  while teaching music to his boss' daughter. The story takes an unexpected turn when Sri Ramachandramurthy meets socialite Meenakshi Doriasamy  who was then pretending to be Chandran's widowed mother. A series of rib-tickling and logic defying scenarios follow, all involving Sri Ramachandramurthy being fooled by Chandran. One scene leads to another and eventually Sri Ramachandramurthy wants to marry off his daughter to Chandran . But in the pre-climax Sri Ramachandramurthy finds out that he was fooled  and, in a fit of rage, chases Chandran across Madras to kill him. Due to his rash driving, it appears as if he might have crippled Chandran's sister during the hilarious chase scene. In the climax actor Kamal Hassan makes a cameo appearance as a fake lawyer who wants to sue Sri Ramachandramurthy on Chandran's behalf. Sri Ramachandramurthy was, for the most part, scared during the lawyer's monologue but, in the end, realized that he was being fooled again â€” this time by the lawyer. At this point all the main characters approach Sri Ramachandramurthy and begin to narrate to him the truth . Disillusioned, a visibly confused and shaken Sri Ramachandramurthy locks himself in a room, only to come out clean shaven after a few minutes, feeling that he doesn't need something which was only a couple of inches long but which caused so much trouble. When lamenting to his God Murugan about his foolishness, the picture of Lord Murugan changes into that of the elephant God Vinayagar; a voice from heaven  apologizes to Sri Ramachandramurthy as he was also one of the people involved in fooling him for so long.
