In the opening scene, secret agent Rock Slag  is being chased through Bedrock. His pursuers, Bobo and Ollie think that they have finally killed him when they push him off a building. Meanwhile, the Flintstones and Rubbles prepare for a camping vacation which includes trying to drop Dino and Hoppy off at the veterinarian. On the way back, Fred crashes Barney's car, and they make a stop at the hospital where Rock Slag is also recovering. After Bobo and Ollie find Rock and put him out of commission, Chief Boulder of the Secret Service enlists look-alike Fred to take his place in Paris for a special meeting. His assignment is to meet Tanya, the Green Goose's #1 lieutenant, who has agreed to turn over the evil Green Goose in return for a chance to meet the irresistible Rock Slag. Not realizing that the Green Goose is not an actual bird, Fred tells his family that their vacation has become an all-expense paid trip to Eurock. Barney and Fred return all the camping gear and use the money to buy the Rubbles tickets to go along. Meanwhile, Ollie and Bobo make several attempts on Fred's life assuming that he is really Rock Slag. Once in Paris, the Chief tells Fred that he must now go to Rome instead, with the help of master of disguise Triple X. Fred makes attempts to sneak away from Wilma to meet with Tanya, but ends up spending the night trying to escape all of Rock's female admirers. After missing a date with Wilma, Fred buys her an imitation diamond necklace from a street hustler to make it up to her, but finds that she slept soundly through the night without realizing he was missing. Flintstone tries to back out of his assignment after finding out that the Green Goose is actually a master criminal, but has pangs of guilt over Pebbles' future and makes an excuse to get away and meet Tanya. Unfortunately, Wilma and the Rubbles go to the same restaurant and catch them together --- thinking that Fred is having an affair. Rock actually shows up to replace Fred, but gets pounded by an angry Wilma and ends up knocked out again. Tanya then leads Fred to the Green Goose, but he is unaware that the Chief has been put out of commission by Bobo and Ollie so he has no back-up. Barney, meanwhile, has followed Fred, and now they are both captured by the Green Goose --- who tortures Barney in attempts to get "Rock" to give him secret information. The Green Goose  makes plans to launch his deadly inter-rokinental missile --- locking Fred and Barney inside until he overhears that Fred has an "expensive" necklace on him. When he opens the door to get at the necklace, the boys turn the tables on the Green Goose and lock him in the missile with Bobo, Ollie, and Tanya --- with the target reset for outer-space. A huge welcome home ceremony is held in Bedrock for the return of hero Fred, but he is just grateful to be back home with his beautiful family, who head on a secret getaway.
