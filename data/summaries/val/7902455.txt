On a unknown location, a group of bald children is receiving tattoos of bar codes and receiving training in firearms and hand-to-hand combat. In these scenes, it is shown that those boys are raised to be assassins and trained to kill. Years later, Interpol agent Mike Whittier  arrives at his house and discovers Agent 47  in his study, where the two talk about 47's life as a professional hitman working for an unknown contractor known as The Organization. The movie unfolds as he tells the story. Three months prior, 47 is completing a hit on a gang leader named Bwana Ovie  in Niger. He receives a communication from his Agency contact, Diana , and is told he is to kill his next target, Russian President Mikhail Belicoff , publicly. He completes his mission as ordered, but before he can leave Russia he is contacted by his employers. They tell him that there is a witness to the assassination and order him to intercept her. When Agent 47 pulls his gun to shoot her on the street, he realizes she's never seen him before. He doesn't shoot her, but just misses being assassinated himself. His employers reveal his location to agents of FSB, who make plans to intercept him. As he is about to be taken, his contact at the agency personally calls him to warn him. She tells him that Belicoff ordered the hit on himself. After a dramatic escape from the hotel, 47 intercepts Nika , the woman who supposedly witnessed his hit, and she is Belicoff's mistress. He interrogates her about Belicoff and discovers that Belicoff had body doubles in place. As Nika and 47 attempt to take a train further into the Russian interior they are intercepted by more assassins from the Agency. 47 kills five of them before wounding Agent Whittier and his partner. Infuriated at yet another escape, the FSB and Agent Markov order Interpol to leave the country immediately. In the meantime, 47 contacts Agent Smith ([[James Faulkner  of the CIA. He offers Smith a deal - he will kill Udre Belicoff , Mikhail's brother, in exchange for a favor from the CIA. Udre is an arms dealer and slave trader whom both the CIA and FSB have wanted dead for some time. Agent Smith informs 47 that Udre had been planning something with a German arms dealer named Price. Intercepting him could lead 47 to Udre. 47 and Nika travel to Istanbul, where 47 abducts Price from a restaurant in order to pose as Price at a meeting with Udre. 47 later kills Udre and his henchmen, so Belicoff's double is forced to attend Udre's funeral. 47 kidnaps Agent Markov and forces him to have his own FSB agents try to shoot Belicoff's double as he delivers a eulogy for Udre. Disguised as a soldier, 47 manages to kill all of Belicoff's double's guards and takes him into the archbishop's chamber in the church. 47 instead kills him and then allows himself to be taken into custody by Interpol and Agent Whittier. At this point Agent Smith delivers on his end of the deal, having the agents under his command intercept the Interpol convoy that is transporting 47 to the airport, giving 47 the distraction necessary to escape. The scene then flashes forward to the conversation between Agent Whittier and 47 occurring at Agent Whittier's house. After wrapping up their conversation, 47 reveals the body of a dead Hitman. 47 suggests Agent Whittier go along with 47's plan, admitting that the body in his home is the real 47, implying that Whittier will not survive if he does not. Nika is shown picking up an envelope from an undisclosed sender. Inside it, there are papers and a message saying that she now owns a vineyard . Meanwhile, 47 is watching her from afar, through the scope of his sniper rifle. He then looks at the corpse of another hitman, lying close to him, and says, "I told you to leave her alone. You should have listened." He then turns back, and walks away.
