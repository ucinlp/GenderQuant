The oil tanker mastered by Capt. Steve Jarvis  is sunk in the north Atlantic Ocean by a German U-boat. He and the first officer, his friend Joe Rossi , make it to a lifeboat along with other crewmen. When the U-boat crew starts filming their plight they respond with rude gestures and are rammed. The men swim to a raft and are rescued after 11 days adrift. During their brief liberty, Steve spends time with his wife Sarah , while Joe meets and marries singer Pearl O'Neill . The film cuts to the union hall where merchant seamen--including the survivors of Jervis' last ship--spend their time waiting to be assigned to a new ship. Over a round of poker, Pulaski  jokes about getting a shore job. When pressed by other seaman, Pulaski reveals his fear of dying at sea. The others shame him into signing along with them for another ship. Another sailor, "Boats" O'Hara , is tracked down by his wife. whom he's apparently not seen since being rescued. She angrily serves him with a summons. O'Hara, knowing he's headed back to sea, gleefully tears the summons up, saying "them 'Liberty Ships' are well named". Then it is back to sea on a new Liberty ship, the SS Seawitch, on a convoy carrying vital war supplies to the Soviet port of Murmansk. Convoy 211 is attacked by a wolfpack, a group of German U-boats that hunt for convoys. There are losses on both sides, but the convoy commander is forced to order his ships to disperse. One persistent U-boat chases after the Seawitch, but loses contact in the night. A pair of Heinkel He 59 seaplanes find the freighter and attack. Both are shot down, but the second crashes into the bow. Steve is shot in the leg during the battle; Joe has to take command. The U-boat sights the ship again and hits her with a torpedo. Joe orders the men to set fires and make smoke so that it appears as if the ship is sinking. When the submarine surfaces to finish her off, Joe rams and sinks it. The Seawitch then limps into Murmansk to a warm Russian welcome.
