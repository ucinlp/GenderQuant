Bugs wanders onto the title card munching his obligatory carrot and absent-mindedly begins reading the title card, grossly mispronouncing all of the credits , such as [Avary] for "Avery" rather than the correct [Avery], and crediting Dave "Menahenn" with the story rather than "Monahan", and animator Charles "Mac-Emson" . When he finally gets to the title itself, he becomes outraged {"Why, the big bunch of joiks!! [to audience] And I oughta know- I woik for 'em"}, tears apart the title card, and rushes to Cecil Turtle's house. He then bets the little, sleepy-eyed turtle ten dollars that he can beat him in a race. Cecil accepts Bugs' bet. After the race starts (with the rabbit easily gaining a [[Head start , he quickly  calls up Chester Turtle and eight other cousins, all of whom look and sound like Cecil . After talking to Chester about the bet, he tells him to call the other cousins and tell them to be ready when he comes to their position, and to "give him the works". Shortly after, and as Bugs runs relentlessly toward the finish line, Cecil and his relatives take turns showing up at just the right moment to baffle the bunny. At one point, Cecil confides to the audience, "We do this kind of stuff to him all through the picture!" In the end, Bugs is convinced he has won, only to see Cecil  across the finish demanding the money. Bugs is left wondering if he's been tricked; then all ten turtles approach and reply, "Hmmm...eh, it's a possibility!" and give Bugs a kiss.
