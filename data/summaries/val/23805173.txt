Lisa Harris is a popular high school student who is more interested in her boyfriend Louis than getting good grades. She is invited to dinner by Kim Fielding, an intelligent classmate who never breaks any rules. She has to babysit her sister Julia, since her father is out of town for the night. Lisa feels she does not have anything in common with her, and she only agrees to come over to meet her boyfriend there. Bored and awaiting his arrival, she joins Kim and Julia in making prank calls. When it's her turn, she calls Adrian Lancer, a man with mental problems who just murdered his girlfriend Robyn Griffin because she declined a marriage proposal from him. Lisa decides to hang up and later calls people, saying "I saw what you did, and I know who you are" before hanging up. Lisa and Kim later discuss Kim's love life, and they decide she needs an older man who appreciates her. They decide on calling Adrian again, but Lisa, afraid to seduce him, repeats the line "I saw what you did, and I know who you are." Adrian, who was caught in the act when he was burying Robyn's body, does not realize it's a prank and is determined to get rid of her. She thinks he was flirting with her on the phone and later calls him again, agreeing to meet with him. She is nervous to actually meet him, but she is convinced that she should drive by his house. Meanwhile, Adrien's neighbor and brother Stephen notices blood coming through the wall, and he starts to suspect that there is something wrong. Adrien notices Kim and Lisa standing in front of his door and opens it. Kim, too afraid to admit she is the girl he talked to on the phone, pretends that their car broke down and that she has to use the phone to call for help. While Lisa is waiting outside, Adrien lets Kim use his phone. She pretends to call someone and mentions she is at Adrien's. Adrien immediately becomes suspicious, as he has not told his name to her. She starts to get afraid of him and leaves, but forgets her purse by mistake. After she drives away, Stephen drops by and informs him that he informed Robyn about his mental problems. Back at home, Louis and his friends finally drop by Kim's house to pick up Lisa. Not wanting to ditch Kim, she decides not to go with him. Kim still feels hurt, though, for finding out Lisa only used her for meeting friends, and Lisa soon leaves. Meanwhile, Adrien is on his way to Kim's house, but a policeman is behind him, trying to pull him over for speeding. After successfully losing him, he soon arrives at Kim's house. Upon confronting her, she admits she prank called him. They are interrupted by a phone call from Lisa, informing Kim that she just heard on the news that Adrien murdered his girlfriend and that he is now presumed dead. Kim tries to warn the police, but Adrien stops her, setting the house on fire. Julia attempts to go out, but Kim stops her, explaining that Adrien is outside, not knowing that he is in fact inside. He attempts to kill Kim, but she and Julia are eventually able to get outside. After Kim and the police arrive, they witness Adrien running outside, burning alive. One night, after the incident is over, Kim receives a phone call from Stephen, who says 'Kim, I know who you are. You killed my brother.' Kim screams.
