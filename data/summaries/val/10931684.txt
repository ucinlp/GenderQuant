John "Hans" Lobert runs a training camp in Florida for baseball's New York Giants. Every year, he evaluates the 18-22-year-old hopefuls to pick the best for a minor league contract. All have dreams and talent, but the elimination whittles them down to a lucky few who will get the $150-a-month contract. Lobert's niece comes down from the home office in New York and finds herself attracted to one of the players, the tall, quiet Adam Polachuk.
