In 2012, the economy of the US collapses. Unemployment and crime rates skyrocket, and the sharp increase of convicted criminals leads to privatized prisons for profit. The warden of Terminal Island penitentiary, Hennessey , earns profits from the pay-per-view broadcast of a modern gladiator game called “Death Race”, using the prisoners as players. The racers, along with their navigators, drive a 3-part race over 3 days on a closed track at Terminal Island. The reward for the drivers is that any racer who wins 5 races will be granted freedom by Warden Hennessey. At the end of one race, a masked driver named Frankenstein  is nearing the finish line against his only surviving competitor, rival Machine Gun Joe . His navigator, Case , reports that his defensive weapons are malfunctioning, and is ordered to eject from the car just before Joe blows it up. On the outside, Jensen Ames  struggles to live normally and provide for his family in the ruined economy. When the steel factory he works at is closed, he returns home and promises his wife that he will provide for her and their new-born daughter. He is suddenly knocked down by a mysterious assailant - waking up covered in blood, with his wife murdered. He is arrested by the police, finding he has been framed for killing his wife. Six months later Ames has been convicted and sent to Terminal Island. Hennessey informs Ames that – unknown to the public and the other racers – Frankenstein is dead, but as he was so wildly popular, she wants to keep his legend alive for the ratings. She coerces Ames to clandestinely assume the persona, with the inducement that Ames would only need to win one race to earn his freedom and take back his daughter since Frankenstein won four. She points out that, by wearing Frankenstein's mask, only a few inside people will know he's not really Frankenstein, including his maintenance crew of Coach , Gunner , and Lists . On Race Day 1, Ames meets Case, his navigator from the nearby woman's prison , who also knows he's not Frankenstein. Ames has a rough first go, coming in last place after three other racers have been terminated. His defensive weapons mysteriously malfunction, just like the previous Frankenstein's last race. Ames pieces together that one of the racers, Pachenko , was the one who killed his wife at the behest of Hennessey so she could recruit him as Frankenstein's replacement to maintain her pay-per-view profits. On Race Day 2, Ames forces Case to admit that she has been sabotaging Frankenstein’s car on the orders of Hennessey in exchange for her release papers. Case was never meant to kill Frank or Ames, just stop them from winning so Frankenstein could remain in Death Race. Ames causes Pachenko's car to crash, leaves his own car, and breaks Pachenko's neck and temporarily teams up with Machine Gun Joe to destroy a massive 18-wheel tanker with many weapons that Hennessey unexpectedly adds to the race to boost ratings, which kills three more racers before being destroyed. Only Ames and Joe survive Day 2, with Joe now aware that Ames is driving as Frankenstein. The two talk after the race. Hennessey, aware that Ames knows her angle, tries to maintain the ruse of granting him freedom but asks him to consider staying on permanently as Frankenstein. As a precaution, she has an explosive planted under his car for Race Day 3, knowing she can replace Ames with another masked Frankenstein. On Race Day 3 Ames  and Joe escape by driving their vehicles through a weakened wall discovered by examining footage of another racer's demise; Hennessey unsuccessfully tries to activate the bomb, which had already been discovered and removed by Coach and the rest of the maintenance team. Hennessey sends attack helicopters after Ames, Case, and Joe, who make it across the bridge that connects the island to the mainland  and split up. When the helicopters follow Ames under Hennessey's orders, Case offers herself as bait in the Frankenstein costume to repay the old Frank, and because she’d already been given her release papers. She is captured while Joe and Ames escape on a freight train. Hennessey, although furious about the escape, is happy about capturing Frankenstein  and also for her earning millions of dollars from the highly successful pay-per-view. She is given an anonymous gift for her record-breaking ratings; it turns out to be the bomb she originally meant for Ames, with a note saying; "WARMEST REGARDS, YOUR MONSTER!". At that moment, Coach remotely detonates the bomb, killing Hennessey, and proceeds to break the fourth wall by looking into the camera and saying "I love this game". Six months afterward, Joe, Ames, and his daughter are shown living honestly in Mexico, where they make a living fixing cars at a local used car dealership. Suddenly, Case shows up in her new modified car. Ames then reflects on how no one could love his daughter more than he does, and that she is his chance at something else, which to him is "all that really matters".
