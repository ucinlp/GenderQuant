The mayor  of a small village in Southeastern Turkey in the 70's bitterly opposes the activities of sleazy opportunist Latif  who runs open-air film screenings and seeks to break his monopoly over village entertainment with the introduction of the first television . The mayor recruits a crazy electrician called Emin  and some of his office staff to help him to set up the signal receiver on the highest position of the mountain. While Latif seeks to undermine his efforts by decrying television as the work of the Devil and a slap in the face of Islamic tradition. The story is based on the childhood memories of the writer-director Yılmaz Erdoğan of the arrival of the first television to Hakkâri, Turkey in the 70's.
