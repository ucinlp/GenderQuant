Frank Leonard , the proprietor of an ice-skating revue, promotes a strong-arming peanut-vendor named Joe Morgan  at the show to a management position based on suggestions he makes to improve the act of the show's star, Roberta Elva , who also happens to be the owner's wife. However, he soon begins to notice that his new manager is paying more attention to his wife than he believes is appropriate, and begins to suspect that his new manager has designs not only on his wife but on his business. The plot thickens later when it appears that the man may have killed the owner.
