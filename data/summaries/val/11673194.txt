Etienne Pimm  has an unusual way of making a living: he arranges for impoverished European aristocrats to marry unsuspecting rich women. He is then discreetly compensated for his efforts by the husbands. His latest target is Millicent "Milly" Mehaffey , newly arrived on the Riviera. Pimm and his assistant Janine  begin grooming the penniless Grand Duke Gaspard Ducluzeau  for Milly, hiring Julian Soames ([[John Wood  to teach him manners and English. As their target fancies herself a race car driver , Pimm recruits John Lathrop Davis , a former Grand Prix champion, to teach Gaspard to drive. Pimm "accidentally" meets Milly's uncle and guardian, Dr. Christian Gump  and invites him to a dinner prepared by his personal, world-renowned chef, Maurice Zoltan . Gump cannot resist. After dinner, he is introduced to the handsome young duke, well prepared after weeks of intensive training. As Pimm had hoped, Gump begs him to bring the duke to a party he has arranged for Milly, confiding that he hopes they fall in love and that his troublesome ward will settle down. Meanwhile, Priory , another of Pimm's minions, has gotten himself hired as the chauffeur, to spy on the family. When a polo ball hit by Gaspard breaks Priory's arm, a reluctant Davis is sent in his place. Davis is openly contemptuous of Milly's amateurish intention to compete in a professional race, causing clashes with his spoiled employer. As they spend more time together though, her initial dislike turns into love. With the romance between Milly and Gaspard not proceeding very well, Pimm suggests to Milly that the young couple spend a romantic night together at his private villa. She takes him up on his offer, only with Davis, not Gaspard. The next morning, Milly learns the truth and is at first outraged, even though Pimm confesses that Davis was not the intended groom. For revenge, she decides to marry an oafish suitor named Freddie . However, on the wedding day, her wise grandmother  convinces her to reconcile with Davis. This is just fine with Gaspard, as he has fallen for Janine.
