Sullen and withdrawn 'ugly' elder sister Masako toils endlessly with mending chores in her widowed mother's dry cleaning shop, seething with hatred for her flashy younger sister Yukari, who visits only for free laundry service. When mother dies and Yukari persists in her abuse, Masako cracks and strangles her. She flees and takes a number of identities and odd jobs, meeting people as she goes. To her surprise Masako finds people in general to be kind and helpful  and she blossoms as a personality, even to the extent of becoming a popularly liked bar hostess like her murdered sister.
