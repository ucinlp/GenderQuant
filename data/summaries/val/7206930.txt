Edwin "Ned" Booth is the son of the noted thespian Junius Brutus Booth and the nephew of another actor, John Wilkes Booth. In 1848, as a young man, he assists Junius, who is often drunk and seems at times on the brink of madness. Several years go by. A theater owner, Dave Prescott, eagerly anticipates a Junius performance in San Francisco, but the actor is again unable to perform. Ned, who has memorized his uncle's lines, substitutes in a performance of Richard III at a mining camp, where the miners, disappointed at first, are ultimately pleased by what they see. Prescott, however, breaks the news later that Junius is dead. Ned returns east, where John Wilkes Booth is on stage doing Taming of the Shrew nightly at Ford's theater in Washington D.C., somewhat envious of his nephew's growing stature as an actor. Ned travels to New Orleans, where he meets and marries a member of a theatrical company, Mary Devlin. The war breaks out and John is said to be working steadfastly for the Confederacy's cause. He declines an offer from Ned to go to London together for a production of Hamlet, and when a pregnant Mary falls ill, Ned begins drinking heavily and missing performances. Mary's death turns her husband morose. Then comes the terrible news one night that John Wilkes Booth has assassinated President Abraham Lincoln by gunshot at Ford's theater. Ned elects to proceed with a scheduled stage performance in New York, where members of the audience shout insults and throw objects at him. He continues with his performance, nonetheless, until all grow quiet at the sound of his voice.
