The boy helps the Frog crawl to the patriarch's home, gathering the entire crowd to watch. They meet up with the patriarch, and he crawls to him, and is "cured". The crippled boy is then genuinely cured, and then Margaret is. Doc Madison, now angry, goes into the house and meets up with Helen, who is surprised he could heal them, and the two step outside in time to hear the patriarch quote the Bible, "Are not two sparrows sold for a pound? Yet one shall not fall to the ground apart from your Father" . The cured boy goes home and shows his father, and soon he believes in God, after being surprised and in tears. Te Madison gang becomes rich on a scheme to build a chapel for the patriarch . Slowly the group disbands, starting with Harry, who is in love with Higgins' daughter. The Frog, now named Michael, acts like a son to the patriarch, taking care of him. Doc is soon jealous of Thornton, as Helen is attracted to him. One night, while Helen is out with Thornton, Doc talks to the Frog inside the house, and he punches him in the face once he mentions Helen's name. The next day, Doc leaves the house and finds that the patriarch's guests are leaving. Doc asks the Frog about Helen, but the Frog will not speak. Doc forces him, nearly breaking his arm, and learns about Thornton and Helen. That night, Helen, after meeting with the patriarch, who praises her as a good girl, goes outside, upset. She is approached by the Frog, and the two talk about the patriarch, and the Frog tells her she is only "socking herself in the chin", and he leaves to go inside. Madison confronts Helen with her affection for Thornton, and he nearly attacks her, but the silhouette of the patriarch stands up from a chair, forcing Madison to leave her alone, by herself, crying. The next day the Frog is at a farm, milking a cow and is talked to by Harry. Soon, out at the shore, Madison is watching, as Helen is on the yacht with Thornton. That night Doc approaches Helen, and is once again about to attack her, but Harry enters the room with the Frog. The gang tell him they want nothing to do with Madison's plan, and he tells them he will leave immediately, leaving Helen heartbroken, as he leaves the room. As Madison gets ready for leaving the town, Thornton stops him, as he tries giving him a check, Madison tells him Helen takes the checks, but Thornton says he will not be seeing Helen, as she broke up with him last night at a storm, and tells him she is in love with him. The patriarch is soon dying, and he calls Helen, and asks where Madison is, but she tells him he is gone, and the patriarch asks for the others  and they approach him. The patriarch tells them he was on to them being con artists, and he knew all along. He says he must wait for John , and this depresses Helen. Soon Madison, now wanting to get Helen, returns and he hears the patriarch's words, and the patriarch dies, leaving the two able to marry.
