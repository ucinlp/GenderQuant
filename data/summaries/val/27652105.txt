Sach receives notice that a dying British earl is his long-lost relative. He travels there with the rest of the gang after exchanging his free first-class ticket for four economy class tickets. Meanwhile, Louie, who is on board to say goodbye, gets locked in a closet and becomes a stowaway. When the boys arrive in London they are treated with disdain from the earl's other relatives, who are secretly plotting to kill the earl. Sach livens up the earl by telling him to eat ice cream instead of his medicine, and generally making him laugh. The earl's health begins to improve and he decides to make Sach is sole heir. The other relatives decide they need to kill off the earl immediately, but are foiled by the boys. Unfortunately just before the earl is to sign the paperwork making Sach the heir, his lawyer arrives and informs them that he made an error and Sach isn't really his relative.
