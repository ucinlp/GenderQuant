Stan and Ollie work in a horn factory, where Ollie is sent home after developing "hornophobia" and starts going crazy each time he hears horns or horn-based musical instruments. A physician  is called to treat Ollie and, warning Ollie that he could develop a more serious condition, "hornomania," he prescribes a relaxing boat trip and goat's milk. Ollie dismisses the idea because he is afraid to sail on the ocean, but Stan prescribes an alternative: they will simply rent a boat and keep it attached to the dock, getting all the sea air they can while never actually going out to sea. When Stan's trombone teacher arrives and Ollie hears the music and throws the teacher out, he knows he should take that advice. Stan and Ollie rent an unseaworthy boat called Prickly Heat that is supposed to stay moored to the dock. An escaped murderer named Nick Grainger stows away on the boat to avoid being caught by the police. The goat which they have brought to provide milk chews away at the docking line and overnight the boat drifts out to sea. Nick confronts Stan and Ollie with a gun  and tells them to make him breakfast. They have no food on board, so they decide to prepare Nick a "synthetic" breakfast made up of string, soap and whatever else they can find. Nick spies on them and realizes what they are up to, and forces them to eat the fake food. Stan becomes inspired and starts to play his trombone. Ollie starts to go crazy and overcomes the criminal.
