A young history student, Maida , a Christian, runs a free school for street children in Jakarta. The school is in a house that once belonged to Ishak Pahing , a Christian Indo composer and pilot, and his Muslim wife Nani Kuddus ; Pahing wrote the song "Pulau Tenggara" , which inspired President Sukarno to help form the Non-Aligned Movement, while living in the house. As Maida learns about Pahing, she decides to write her undergraduate thesis about his life. One day her class is interrupted by the young Muslim architect Sakera , who has been told to evict Maida's school by his employer, the developer Dasaad Muchlisin . As Maida and Sakera argue in the streets, rioting breaks out around them. Sakera protects the half-Chinese Maida, then tells her that he will help her keep the house, although it is scheduled to be demolished within a week. After attempts to persuade Muchlisin to keep the original design fail, Sakera overhears that the house is on disputed land. Maida uses the information, as well as feedback from a traditional musical group distantly related to Pahing, to discover that the house has a secret underground bunker, in which she and Sakera&nbsp;– with whom she has begun to fall in love&nbsp;– find documents showing the history of the house. With the help of her mother's former lover Kuan , she discovers the true ownership of the house. Pahing, who had grown up within the nascent independence movement and associated with several historical figures, was arrested for being half-Dutch by the Japanese spy Maruyama &nbsp;– a man who coveted Pahing's wife. After being tortured, Pahing was released to discover that his wife had been raped and killed; their newborn son Fajar had been kidnapped. Pahing later died on a flight carrying medical supplies over Yogyakarta when the flight was shot down. Meanwhile, his son was raised by Maruyama&nbsp;– the kidnapper&nbsp;– and had his name changed to Dasaad Muchlisin. With this information, Maida, Sakera, and Kuan approach Muchlisin and tell him how the house features in his history. After a short silence, Muchlisin tells them to leave. Several months later, on Maida and Sakera's wedding day&nbsp;– when they are married at both a mosque and a church&nbsp;– Muchlisin comes to the church and says that he has abandoned his plans to demolish the house. Instead, he renovates the building and dedicates it as a school for street children.
