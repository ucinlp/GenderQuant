Tiska , Taska  and Baska  Jones, three snippy society girls, are willed an inheritance so long as they are married, but their fiances postpone their engagements. Their shrewd lawyer Diggin  suggests they marry three death row inmates  to retain the dough; once they are married, they get their inheritance, the convicts are hung, and can marry their fiances free and clear. They do so, but the boys are pardoned by the governor, and as the girls celebrate their new bout of widowhood, the Stooges make their way into their house and make themselves at home.  Mortified, the devious debutantes try to think up an excuse to divorce their new beaus and decide to force them to become society gentlemen, something they feel the Stooges will be unable to accomplish. After enrolling the Stooges in an ill-fated dance lesson, and after finding them to be more accommodating to entering society after Moe realizes what they are up to. Diggin suggests that the girls throw a formal party, hoping the Stooges will make a shambles of the evening. They do, of course, and the evening ends with the Stooges first genuine pie fight. Diggin chastises the boys for their social ineptness and threatens to annul their marriages at once. However, the girls have had enough of Diggins and decide to remain married to the Stooges. They along with the other guests in attendance strike back at Diggins by covering him in pie from head to toe.
