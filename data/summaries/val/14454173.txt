The Stooges are unsuccessful fish salesmen. After becoming fed up with it all, they decide to go into the saloon business. When Curly tells a Mexican real estate dealer  their saloon has "...gotta have class and gotta have beauty," they end up with a beauty "saloon." Undaunted, the trio try their hand at giving a customer  a mud pack using, natural, real mud. After chiseling the cement off her face, the boys scalp three other Mexican beauties before having their bottoms shot full of holes.
