The film is a study of prejudice and discrimination. It tells the story of a black gang who run the streets of Watta and of Jim, a white man, who tries to befriend them. Prejudice stands in the way of any friendship and turns black against white in a mid '70s, does much to show how society has progressed, but to some it may seem that "the more things change, the more they stay the same."
