Adjeng  lives alone in an apartment paid for by her boyfriend, a rich businessman . A writer of children's stories, she wishes to write short stories for adults; in this, she is mentored by Asmoro &nbsp;– with whom she is also having sex. Meanwhile, Adjeng's mother  handles various aspects of her life, constantly calling her and visiting without giving notice. This has led Adjeng's friends, Venny  and Andien , to tease her about her overbearing mother. When Adjeng goes clubbing with her friends, she drinks too much and vomits, later passing out in a toilet. As she lies with her head on the seat she recalls that, as a child , she had been forced to eat vegetables she had previously vomited. Later, when Andien uses her apartment for a one-night stand, Adjeng peeks and recalls how she had observed her mother having sex with her lover , a man who had previously molested Adjeng&nbsp;– an act which is not shown explicitly. This background, as well as her recollections of life as a teenager  at the home of her womanising father  are worked into Adjeng's short story "Lintah" . When Asmoro reads the story, he says that it is unrealistic and that readers need a climax. However, Adjeng insists that reality is unrealistic and that not all victims of rape are willing to call the police. Several days later, while they are lying in bed, Asmoro shows Adjeng that "Lintah" had been published in Kompas. Adjeng's mother, aware of the story's autobiographical nature, is furious and, after going to Adjeng's apartment, blames everything on Adjeng's father abandoning them. Upset, Adjeng goes out with Venny and Andien, but when the two begin arguing about motherhood Adjeng leaves them both in the street. She then goes to a café to drink with Asmoro, who comforts her. When she returns home she checks her messages, most of which are about the short story. Venny and Andien, meanwhile, return to their families and think of the importance of children. The following day, Asmoro sees the businessman, Adjeng's boyfriend, leaving her apartment, which puts him in a foul mood. He and Adjeng fight, and Asmoro almost smothers Adjeng with a pillow before saying that they are through. As Adjeng lays on the bed, she recalls how her mother's lover raped her and how her mother murdered him. As the phone rings, Adjeng watches the people from her past going about life in a residential complex, smiles, and returns to writing.
