A small word "Big" turns large, as in "Clifford's Really Big Movie". Everyone on Birdwell Island comes to the carnival, and Emily Elizabeth spots an attraction known as "Larry's Amazing Animals". There were 2 dogs starring in the show: Rodrigo, Chihuahua of Steel and Dirk the Extreme Dachshund. They watch the show until Dorothy the High Wire Heifer aka Daring Cow, loses her balance, and the show is ruined. But when P.T. comes, Shackelford the High Flying Ferret sees George C. Wolfsbottom's commercial. However, the dogs join the group by just leaving. Then the Amazing Animals are shocked when they see the dog's tags, but Cleo the poodle makes up a lie to get into the group. Then, Clifford the Big Red Dog, T Bone the bulldog and Cleo asked in unison "Shackelford, Rodrigo, Dorothy and Dirk, we will be your new friends and you will be ours. Will you please let us join your show?" Shackelford and the animals agreed. They are in the next performance. Dorothy loses her balance again, but Clifford saves her. The next day, Clifford tames Dorothy's fear of heights. Then Shackelford gets really jealous of Clifford, until he sees the new poster, then he forces him to get out of the group. Just then, Cleo and T-Bone catch up and show him a new move consisting of them flipping. Then they venture home, until then Larry's car stops and it rolls back, so then he saves it by pushing it. They then go to Shangri-Large. They go to the show and they win, but when Wolfsbottom tempts him for some Tummy Yummies, Clifford is kidnapped. Larry calls Wolfsbottom, then he calls Emily, and they go on a quest to stop him. The gang gets through, but T-Bone sets off the alarm. The two then perform the move and go onto a wild goose chase, until Wolfsbottom and Madison arrive at the exit until Emily arrives. Wolfsbottom is mad, but Madison doesn't care. She wants Emily to have Clifford again, because "Clancy"  belonged to her first. They go home and Emily and Clifford run on the beach.
