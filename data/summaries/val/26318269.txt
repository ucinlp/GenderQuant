Arizona inventor Doc Williams has invented a wireless remote control  that can fly an aeroplane, Despite his efforts and those of his friend, pilot Jerry Barton, they can not interest anyone in the invention. Barton has found a job as a test pilot for a millionaire named George Lambert with his own aircraft company. When Doc brings a model of his invention, the two send their model aeroplane to buzz Lambert on the golf course. Lambert is fascinated and arranges a test, but his daughter Betty isn't; especially when the model lands in a puddle and drenches her. When the time comes for a test of the device installed in a real aircraft, Jerry takes the plane up and switches the plane to remote control. United States Army Air Force observers are skeptical that Jerry is flying the plane himself so Jerry parachutes out of the aircraft. Sadly the device is not perfected and the aircraft crashes. The event is observed by foreign agents working undercover at Lambert Field. Doc and Jerry return in failure to Arizona to perfect the device. At the same time Betty announces she wishes to go to Hollywood, with her Aunt Maude making an in joke about John Barrymorehttp://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page5473 being free. Betty and Maude drive to Hollywood when their vehicle runs out of petrol near Doc and Jerry's home. The girls decide to steal petrol from an aerodrome beacon but are caught. As Doc is a local Federal Aviation Administration official, he arrests the girls and holds them in custody. They telegraph George Lambert what they have done and they ask and receive his permission to teach the haughty Betty a lesson by making the girls do their housework until "Judge Gildersleeve" comes to sentence them of who they attempt to frighten the girls with tales of his imaginary severe sentences. Maude later overhears the boys' scheme and wins them over by saying its a great idea; the spoiled Betty has had only her way since childhood and the experience would be good for her. Meanwhile the enemy agents at Lambert Field conspire to hijack a new Lambert designed bomber being tested at Lambert Field. Like Betty and Maude, the bomber somehow ends up crashing near Doc and Jerry's house with the agent surviving the crash and pretending he has been in an automobile accident. When Doc and Jerry learn the truth, the agent hijacks Doc's aeroplane with the two girls as hostages. However Doc's plane has the teleoperation control device installed that now works and Doc and Jerry are able to land the plane and capture the agent. At the end of the film the real Judge Gildersleeve, a midget, appears and fines the girls with Maude breaking the fourth wall and asking the audience if they believed what they saw.
