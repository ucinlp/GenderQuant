Myra's plan goes awry as her unsteady mental health begins to fray.Review, Time Out, LondonQNetwork review by James Kendrick She tells Billy to kill the girl, and he takes her into the woods and leaves her body under a tree. When the police ask Myra to conduct a séance to help them find the missing girl – as she had hoped they would – she breaks down during the séance and reveals, as if in a psychic trance, what she and Billy have done. Billy tells the police where he hid the ransom money and reveals that he did not kill the girl, but left her unconscious where she would be found by scouts camping nearby.
