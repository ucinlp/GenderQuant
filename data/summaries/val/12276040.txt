Anbu  is a happy-go-lucky guy, who lives with his family in Pattukottai and is having a good time singing energetic fast numbers like "Kantha Kadamba" with his friends. One day he gets into a fracas with a local politician  and his comic henchmen while trying to save a friend and is arrested and a case registered against him. The local court gives him conditional bail, provided he signs the register in a Tiruchi police station! On the way to Trichy police station, he sees a girl on a terrace  drying clothes and falls for her. It is love at first sight for Anbu as he becomes crazy about Malar  a college girl, which leads to some hilarious situations. The police station, where he has to sign daily, is manned by his Chittappa Kanthaswamy , a comic sub-inspector whose ex-lover Kamala  is the constable at the station. Anbu kindles the love life of his uncle and makes merry at Malar’s college, leading to funny situations. Meanwhile Trichy city is run by a powerful politician Palani  and his brother Guna , who have killed the local RDO in cold blood watched by a huge crowd of onlookers. The brothers continue with their ‘dada giri’, till they clash with a brave heart. He is none other than Anbu who, while trying to save Malar from a difficult situation, ends up getting the wrath of the brothers. Anbu, the one-man army, does a good demolition job and cleans Trichy of all its baddies.
