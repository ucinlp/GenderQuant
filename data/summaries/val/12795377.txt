Set in Fleetwood, on the Fylde coast, in North West England, it was filmed in and around the town and also on location in Scotland and Sweden. It is a tale that has the viewer undecided whether it is a psychological thriller, a ghost story, or a murder mystery right until the final climactic moments. The film is set two years after the disappearance of Kath Swarbrick's older sister, Annie. Kath is haunted by Annie's disappearance and continues to investigate herself. On the discovery of some strange CCTV footage she appears to lose her grip on reality. Friends and colleagues are concerned for her sanity and beg her to stop. She is spurred on when she discovers that she has recurring visions of Annie in an otherworldly landscape, which is actually the estuary of the River Wyre in Morecambe Bay, after visiting the last known location of her sister. She begins to wonder if this is a clue, a warning, or a glimpse into the afterlife.
