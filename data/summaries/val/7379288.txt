Indio is a fourteen-year-old-boy who lives in Playas de Tijuana. Every day after school, Indio works at Sacramento’s ranch in the hopes of buying his own cockfighting rooster, el Gyro. When his dad refuses to help him buy the rooster, Indio starts selling empanadas and washing cars. One day, after he skips school to play with his friends, Indio meets Brianda, a young prostitute working in the red light district. As time passes, Indio learns what it means to make money, a tough journey that takes him cross the border, from Montes Olímpicos to San Diego. Greed however takes the best of Indio; neglecting his rooster, he fights el Gyro to win over the love of Brianda.
