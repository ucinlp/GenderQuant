{{POV-section}} The Tar Creek area was home to one of the largest lead and zinc strikes on the planet. Now it’s home to America's worst environmental disaster. Acid mine water in the creeks, stratospheric lead poisoning in the children, and sinkholes that do the unthinkable to small town America. This place is the stuff of science fiction. Except Tar Creek is centered around Picher, Oklahoma, America's Heartland. And it might be the one place in the States where you'd swear you stepped into a third world country. It’s so bad here that the federal government is buying everyone’s homes and moving them out. At least they are trying to. Corruption from Senator Jim Inhofe's office on down to the local Trust in charge of the buyout has forced some to remain because they can't afford to move. This land belongs to the Quapaw Tribe, and the Tribe will be handed back the worst Superfund site in the country after the government moves everyone away. Worse still, the Bureau of Indian Affairs made the mining companies leave all of this lead-laced waste rock on their land—75 million tons of it—which has caused this pandemic lead poisoning. For over 100 years, the government has been controlling Tar Creek, from Indian Removal to subsidizing wartime mining to 200 million in cleanup funds to the eventual buyout of families. And the reason why these people were kept here for so long is one of the oldest and ugliest of our own legacy.
