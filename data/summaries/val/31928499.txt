In a city where streets are overrun by drug dealers, those who have sworn to uphold the law are breaking it to better suit their own needs. Four friends CHEEMA, JAMAL, JOHNNY and JUGGY who are high school friends only have one thing in mind . They all get into the drug trafficking industry for different reasons but a common goal - get rich fast. Helped by a friend, a cop nicknamed SLEAZE, an officer whose methods of enforcing the law are questionable, they co-ordinate a series of raids against known drug dealers and steal from them. But when money and power is involved it doesn’t take much to turn on each other. When it becomes clear to both the drug boss and Sleaze’s hit squad that everyone is playing a dark game of lies and deceit, everyone suddenly feels himself in danger of being caught and exposed to the enemy and is in a race to uncover the true intention of the other man in time to save himself. But will either of them be willing to turn on friends and comrades they've made during their long years? 'Pseudo' follows Sleaze as he takes the law into his own hands and the power of money becomes obvious and the loyalty and trust among friends is put to test.
