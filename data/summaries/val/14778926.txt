Garth , a cyborg from the future, travels back in time to 1966 to prevent Professor Sigmund Marx  from revealing his new discovery, an idea that will make mind control possible and create a tyranny in Garth's time. He is pursued by two "Tracers"  out to stop him. Garth enlists the help of Dr. Sharon Mason , Marx's assistant. He gets her to summon her friend, medical doctor Zeller  to operate on him, to remove a homing device used by the Tracers to track him. The local sheriff  also becomes involved. Garth defeats the Tracers and convinces Professor Marx to keep his discovery secret. Then, with his future wiped out as a result, Garth ceases to exist; the people who helped him do not even remember him.
