Marion Davies plays twins separated at birth: Anne becomes a society girl in New York and Fely becomes an Irish poor girl turning to the musical world. Dirk , Anne's half brother, falls in love with the poor sister, with the added inconvenient that Anne's family owns the slum in which the Irish families live.
