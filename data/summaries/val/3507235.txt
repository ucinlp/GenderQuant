The film is set in Tokyo at an unknown time where the Japanese yen have become the strongest currency in the world. This attracted influx of immigrants, legal and illegal, to work in the city. The immigrants gave the city a nickname {{nihongo}}. The Japanese natives however, despise such nickname, and in retribution they called the immigrants {{nihongo}}, anglicised as "Yentowns" in the film's English subtitles. In the Japanese language, the two unrelated kanji - {{nihongo}} and {{nihongo}} are different in writing but share the same pronunciation. <ref nameYomota |firstStranger Than Tokyo: Space and Race in Postnational Japanese Cinema |titleJenny Kwok Wah Lau |locationTemple University Press |year1-56639-985-8}} The story centers on a sixteen-year-old girl  whose mother has just died. The girl is passed on from person to person until she is taken in by a Chinese Yentowns prostitute named Glico , who names her Ageha . Under Glico's care, Ageha starts a new life. The immigrant characters, who speak Japanese, English, Mandarin, or Cantonese, earn their living by committing petty crimes and engaging in prostitution. Ageha does not participate in any of these activities, but is protected by Glico and the other immigrants. The film does not make clear whether Ageha is Japanese or an Asian immigrant. Eventually, due to a sudden twist in fate, the immigrants are given a chance to realize their various dreams. But in doing so, they destroy their solidarity, and have to face their problems separately.
