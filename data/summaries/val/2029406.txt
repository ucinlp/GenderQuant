On a desolate planet, a team of 12 Xeno project scientists are conducting an archaeological excavation of the ruins of an ancient civilisation. Shortly after an underground tomb network is found to contain crystals and wall inscriptions, photographer Dean White  is engulfed in a rock blast and left incapacitated. Deciphering the alien language in the caves, xenolinguist Mitch ([[Trevor Thomas  theorises that the civilisation was built on the concept of dualism: the planet orbits a binary star, and a pair of twins seems to have ruled the race that once inhabited it. Medical assistant Sharon  finds that an energy field surrounds the crystals, leading her to believe that a "chemical intelligence" ordered life on the planet. A deranged Ricky Williams  is impelled to re-enter the caves when a sample of crystals starts to pulsate and the chemical intelligence exerts its influence through a mark on his arm. Thrown into a grille in a compromised environmental suit, a panicked Gail  commits suicide, removing her helmet and freezing to death in the toxic atmosphere while trying to amputate her trapped foot with a chainsaw. Documentation officer Kate Frost  shoots Ricky with a harpoon gun before he opens both the inner and outer airlock doors and renders the air inside the base unbreathable. Following the burial of Ricky and Gail, Mitch and Sandy  return to the caves to collect more crystals. A monstrous creature appears and dismembers Mitch before proceeding to rape Sandy. Found distraught, Sandy receives treatment from Sharon and chief medical officer Karl , who discovers that the assault has initiated an accelerated pregnancy despite the regular intravenous injections of contraceptives given to the women in the team. When further explosions within the catacombs scupper chances of deeper investigation, the surviving members of the team are left with nothing to do except await the arrival of a Xeno rescue shuttle. The intelligence assumes control of Sandy, who has been marked in the same way as Ricky. Mentally unbalanced, Sandy demonstrates superhuman strength while stabbing Barbra  to death with scissors. She then mutilates Dean and the remains of Mitch, drinking their blood. The rest of the team seek refuge in the Operations Room as Sandy destroys important hardware—including the base transmitter—with explosives. When the imbalance in Sandy's mind appears to correct itself, Karl, Sharon and Commander Holly McKay  attempt sedation to spare her unborn offspring. Sandy's madness returns and Holly and Karl are killed in an accident with heat-sealing apparatus, whereupon Sandy disembowels the corpses.  Senior officer Mark  radios Sandy, his lover, from the Operations Room to stall for time as Kate and operations chief Gary  leave to commandeer chainsaws. The ruse is uncovered and Sandy harpoons Gary outside the airlock, breathing the atmosphere to no ill effect as she mauls his flesh. Preparing for a final confrontation, Mark stumbles across Sandy's newborn mutant twins. He entrusts them to Sharon as their mother blasts through the Operations Room door and destroys all the equipment inside, although it is evident that she has lost her unnatural strength. Crippled from the blast of an explosive charge, Kate is gored to death. In a last stand, Mark strangles and kills Sandy with a ripped-out cable. He returns to Sharon to find one of the twins biting at her gashed neck, before its sibling launches itself at him. Twenty-eight days later, Xeno Auxiliary Module 047 lands on the planet to investigate the loss of contact with the team. With the base in ruins, the mission records destroyed and the complement of scientists either murdered or missing, combat marksmen Corin  and Roy  abandon the search for survivors and pilot Jeff  contacts Xeno control to request clearance to return. The final shots reveal that Sandy's children have stowed themselves away inside a storage compartment on board the shuttle.
