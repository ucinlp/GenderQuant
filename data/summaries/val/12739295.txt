Jack Faro  is, at the time of the film, a recovering drug addict who has had so many relapses in the past, he ultimately decided to move into his rehab and just live there. Having been married 75 times, he is a serial husband and is always on the lookout for number 76 . Even with his faults, he is a lovable guy who, just out of rehab, enters The Grand: a huge Texas Hold 'Em poker tournament in Las Vegas created by his grandfather Lucky Faro . His main motivation is to win the 10 million dollar pot to cover a loan he got from another ultimately apathetic casino owner to keep open his family's casino, The Rabbit's Foot, whom his grandfather left him when he died and that he has mismanaged into the ground. It is also a matter of contention in the film that Jack is playing in a poker competition that he owns. The rest of the players all "won" their seats after winning an online poker tournament. The other players in The Grand include the Schwartzman twins, Larry  and Lainie , who have been forced into a sibling rivalry throughout their lives by their father . Harold Melvin  is a genius with social issues who still lives with his mother . Other contestants are Andy Andrews , a math teacher; Deuce Fairbanks , a wily old veteran of Vegas, and The German , a cheater who ritualistically sacrifices small animals to gain luck at cards.
