{{plot}} For summer vacation, the Waits family has decided to vacation in the town of Nilbog, a remote farming community, where they will swap houses with one of the local residents and spend the summer living off of the land. Young Joshua Waits ([[Michael Stephenson  is contacted by the ghost of his dead grandfather, Seth , who warns him about monsters known as goblins — malicious vegetarians who turn people into human/plant hybrids in order to eat them. Meanwhile, Joshua's sister, Holly , receives a visit from her boyfriend Elliot , with whom she has been having relationship problems: Holly is concerned that Elliot spends too much time with his friends. Elliot assures Holly of his love for her, and tells her that he will prove it by accompanying her family to Nilbog. The next morning, Elliot fails to show up at the Waits house; parents Michael  and Diane  grow impatient waiting for him to arrive, and the family departs for Nilbog. En route they meet up with Elliot, who has decided to bring along his friends Brent , Arnold  and Drew  in an RV. The family also runs across a hitchhiker whom Grandpa Seth uses as a medium to channel himself, warning Joshua that the town of Nilbog is the Kingdom of Goblins and that his family has been lured there to be made into food. Arriving in Nilbog, the Waits family discovers that the residents have left a large, all-vegetable meal for them. Grandpa Seth appears again, freezing time and warning Joshua that the food is actually a potion that will turn them into vegetable people. When time resumes, Joshua jumps on the table and urinates on all of the food. Meanwhile, Arnold takes a walk in the woods outside of Nilbog and runs into a woman, Cindy, being pursued by goblins. They seek shelter in a chapel that turns out to be the residence of Creedence Leonore Gielgud , who feeds them a goblin potion—the woman disintegrates into a mass of green ectoplasm, while Arnold becomes a plant/human hybrid. Creedence reveals herself to be the druid queen of the Goblins, whose "Stonehenge Magic Stone" is the source of all the goblins' power; a horrified Arnold watches as goblins consume the ectoplasm, realizing that he will be next. Although Drew ultimately finds him and attempts to free him, he is killed by Creedence. That night, Holly is unintentionally contacted by Seth via a mirror and she and Joshua swap rooms. On Seth's instructions, Joshua destroys all of the food in the house, which only results in Michael taking him on a trip to the town general store the next morning. They find the store closed, with all the town's inhabitants attending a "sermon" about the evils of eating meat held by the town's demonic preacher. Joshua sneaks away to the church where the goblins have congregated. The goblins capture Joshua and attempt to feed him ice cream spiked with Goblin potion, but Michael arrives, prompting the goblins to let Joshua go. A suspicious Joshua and Michael return home, only for the family to be met by seemingly the entire town of Nilbog, who want to throw them a party. Joshua runs upstairs to try to contact Grandpa Seth through the mirror, only to be confronted by Creedence in goblin form. Grandpa Seth suddenly appears out of thin air and chops off Creedence's hand with an axe, prompting her to retreat. Grandpa Seth and Joshua go back downstairs to prevent the family from eating any food. The town preacher  attempts to stop them by trying to banish Seth to Hell, but Seth causes a magic lightning bolts to ignite a molotov cocktail, killing the preacher. When the preacher dies, he transforms into his true, goblin form; Seth's presence and the sight of the dead goblin finally convince the family that they are in danger. Seth disappears, and the family barricade themselves inside the house. Meanwhile, Creedence transforms herself into a beautiful young woman and appears at Elliot's RV in an exotic negligee, where she seduces Brent using an ear of corn, . As they begin to have sex, the corn spontaneously explodes into a flood of popcorn. Brent is quickly swallowed up and left immobilized but alive; with the family's last hope of rescue neutralized, Creedence heads back to her chapel. Back at the house, Joshua, Elliot, Holly, Michael and Diane hold a séance to communicate with Seth. Seth appears and tells them that in ten minutes he will be permanently cut off from the mortal world. Although goblins invade the house and kidnap Joshua, Seth is able to pass him a backpack, which Seth informs him has a weapon that will save him from mortal danger; he is further able to tell Joshua that if he can touch the Stonehenge Magic Stone, it will drain the goblins of their power. In Creedence's chapel, Joshua opens the backpack and discovers a bologna sandwich. He eats it, "tainting" his blood with meat and preventing the goblins from consuming him. The Waitses and Elliot then arrive and, together, they all touch the Stonehenge Magic Stone, destroying Creedence and all of her goblins. The next day, the Waits family heads back home; Diane eats food in their refrigerator, not realizing that it was placed there by the family with whom they exchanged houses. She is transformed into a human/plant hybrid and eaten by the remaining goblin family; the film ends with a screaming Joshua being offered a piece of his mother's corpse to eat.
