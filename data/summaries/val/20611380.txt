 The Pink Panther works as a waiter at the Gong Ho Cantonese Restaurant, which features food orders being placed by striking a huge gong x amount of times, depending on the order. Unfortunately, a new fine china store called House of Glass moves in upstairs with a sign in the window declaring "Opening Soon." The end result are shards of broken glass every time the panther places an order. Despite several attempts by the store owner to prevent glass from flying everywhere, his store is reduced to rubble in a matter of a few hours.
