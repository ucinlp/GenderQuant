Set in 16th century India, this movie depicts the story of two girls who were raised together, though they came from different social classes. Tara  is an upper-caste princess while Maya  is her beautiful servant. The two girls are best friends until they get old enough for marriage. Tara is prepared to marry Prince Raj Singh , but Maya is forced into the role of the inferior servant. This culminates in an argument, where Tara reminds Maya of her low position in life. Resentful, Maya decides to take revenge when she chances on Raj alone. She sleeps with Raj, but unknown to both, Tara's hunchback brother, Prince Vikram aka Viki, hides and watches the two of them engage in sexual intercourse. He becomes crushed that his childhood infatuation slept with his brother-in-law. As Tara is leaving home as a newly-wedded bride to Raj, Maya tells her that just as Maya wore the princess's used clothes all her life, Tara will now have something Maya has used. To save Maya's honor, Viki sends a marriage proposal for her. When she refuses, he brands her as a whore, and she is forced to leave her home. Wandering on her own, she meets a young stone sculptor, Jai Kumar . Realizing she has nowhere to stay, Jai takes her to an older woman named Rasa Devi , who is a teacher of the Kama Sutra, the ancient art of seduction and making love. Maya begins a romantic relationship with Jai that is abruptly halted when he realizes he might not be able to work properly with Maya consuming his thoughts. Maya seeks comfort with Rasa Devi, making the decision to learn the courtesan's art. Raj, now the king, recognizes the visage as Maya's in one of Jai's sculptures. He dispatches his attendants to find Tara and succeeds. Maya is then delivered to the King as his new concubine. Soon after, Raj and Jai have a friendly wrestling competition, in which Jai wins but also gets the King's favor. Jai then learns of Maya's new status as favored concubine. In the meantime, the threat of an invading Shah inches closer. As Raj descends deeper into debauchery, he becomes irresponsible with his duties as King. He insults Viki sexually and for his hunchback. In retaliation, Viki writes a letter to the Shah to rid the kingdom of Raj, who now taxes the poor for his own pleasure. Jai and Maya resuscitate their love and get married. The two begin meeting in secret, as tensions between Jai and Raj grow. Raj later catches the two lovers together, and sentences Jai to death. Maya realizes that she must make difficult choices as she finds she must either accept her role as concubine to the King, or help her loved ones, who are headed down their own paths of destruction, all because of her presence in their lives. After finding Tara in the midst of a suicide attempt, Maya and Tara reconcile. Maya then teaches Tara how to seduce the King, while Tara promises to help Maya escape to visit Jai. However, when Tara goes to her husband, she tells him that she doesn't love him enough to hate him, and leaves. Maya leaves the castle and visits Jai one last time. She cuts her hair, symbolizing the end of their marriage. Maya then tries her best to make Raj free Jai by promising him everything. But knowing he can't have her heart, he rejects her plea. Just before the execution, a box arrives from the Shah, holidng the severed head of the grand vizier. Jai is killed, while Maya watches from the crowd. She leaves, just as the Shah's army arrives. Viki, riding with the army, sees Maya and calls to her, but she doesn't respond. She walks away alone, with new wisdom and strength, a heart 'as open as the sky'.
