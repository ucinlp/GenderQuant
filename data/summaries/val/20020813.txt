Two detectives, Jack Welles  and Eddie Hatcher , investigate a daring heist by a group of well-organized bank robbers. The crew, led by Gordon Cozier , consists of John , A.J. , and brothers Jake  and Jesse ([[Chris Brown  Attica. The crew is without a former member, Ghost , who was caught during a previous robbery 5 years ago. In his absence, Jake has begun a relationship with his former girlfriend Lilly , who has accepted his proposal. Ghost surprises the crew after getting paroled. He insists he harbors no ill feelings toward the crew for abandoning him and draws them into a heist of an armored car for a $20 million dollar payoff. Meanwhile, Welles begins to zero in on some of the members of the crew and comes up with evidence that a second heist is in the making. They create a subway and call it "The Subway".They place bombs underneath the road,so when the armored truck passes above. The bombs will be detonated and the truck will fall through. During the heist Welles and Hatcher interrupt. Meanwhile the truck was stopped by the cops and it is a couple feet away from the spot where it is suppose to land ,but there is also another amored truck behind the first one with the money. So the crew is forced to go back up on the street, steal the second armored truck and push the first truck in the hole. A protracted chase ensues during which Jesse is cornered and he is forced to shoot Detective Hatcher in his escape. Despite his partner's best efforts, Hatcher dies from his wounds. Jesse reconvenes with the rest of the crew at a hotel room and admits to the shooting of Hatcher and this almost results in a confrontation between Jesse and Gordon. Russian gangsters immediately storm the room and attempt to gun down everyone present except for Ghost, who earlier snuck out through a window. Ghost had previously cut a deal with the Russian gangsters to kill his former crewmates in exchange for half of the heist's take. A.J. dies in the ensuing firefight but Jake manages to kill the Russians. Jake and Jesse return home where, to his horror, Jake finds Lilly's lifeless body. The police surround their home and shoot the two when they make a suicide charge outside. Gordon and John separate to make their escape but realize Ghost intends to take all of their money, which is being held by Scott , a well-connected fence. Ghost sneaks onto Scott's private plane and kills him, taking their laundered money in two large suitcases. Gordon and Detective Welles arrive and a three-way Mexican standoff results in which Ghost hits both Gordon and Welles. As Ghost prepares to finish off Gordon, John arrives and shoots him dead. He and an injured Gordon take the money and drive off, with Gordon's sister Naomi  in tow. A gravely-wounded Welles manages to call 911 for help on his cell phone. As John and Gordon drive off, John asks Gordon "Are we good?" and Gordon replies by saying "All signs point to it." . The film ends without revealing whether either Gordon or Welles survive their injuries.
