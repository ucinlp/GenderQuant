A soldier, Joe Allen , on a 48-hour leave, meets Alice Mayberry  in Pennsylvania Station when she trips over his duffel bag and breaks the heel off one of her shoes. Although it is after hours, Joe gets a shoe-repair shop owner to open his store, and the proprietor repairs her shoe. Alice asks Joe where he is going, and he says he is on leave but has no definite destination while in New York. He asks to accompany her on her way home and she points out landmarks along the way, including Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. When he asks her whether she is busy that evening, she says that she is. However, when he persists, chasing the bus she is riding down the street, she relents, promising to meet him under the clock at the Astor Hotel. Although her roommate chastises Alice for "picking up" a soldier, Alice keeps her date with Joe, arriving late, and the two have dinner. Having missed the last bus home, they accept a ride with a milk man. When the milk man's truck has a flat tire, he and his passengers visit a lunch room to call for assistance. A drunk strikes the milk man, blackening his eye, and after the company's road repairman has changed the truck's tire, Alice and Joe spend the night delivering milk to their benefactor's customers. Later, they enjoy the hospitality of the milk man and his wife, who serves them an early-morning dinner. Although they become separated in a subway, trying frantically to find one another, they reunite by returning to the place at which they met for their first date, the clock at the Astor Hotel. Having fallen in love, Joe asks Alice to marry him, and she consents. However, they must run a maze of red tape which nearly prevents them from doing so. Through their perseverance, they win over bureaucrats upon whom their success or failure depends. However, Alice finds the ceremony "ugly" and it is only after they repeat their vows in a church that she feels truly married. Shortly after the young couple weds, Joe's leave ends and he returns to war.
