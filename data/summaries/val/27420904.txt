In 1977, in Montreal, the scared writer Wilbur Gray  visits his publisher Frank Richards  to disclose his new book about the evilness of cats. Wilbur tells that the felines are supernatural creatures, and that there is a saying in which the cat would be the devil in disguise. Wilbur tells three tales to illustrate his thoughts: In 1912, in London, Miss Malkin is a wealthy woman that rewrites her will leaving her fortune to her cats rather than to her nephew Michael. Her maid Janet, also mistress of Michael, steals one copy of the will from the lawyer's briefcase and tries to destroy the original copy which is kept in the safe. When Miss Malkin sees her attempt, Janet kills her but the cats ultimately avenge Miss Malkin. In 1975, in the Province of Quebec, the orphan Lucy comes to live with her aunt Mrs. Blake, her husband and her cousin Angela after the death of her parents in a plane crash. Lucy brings her only friend, a cat called Wellington, but her mean cousin forces her parents to get rid of it. Lucy uses her mother's book of witchcraft to get her revenge. In 1936, in Hollywood, the actor Valentine De'Ath  replaces the blade of a fake pendulum to kill his wife and also actress and give a chance to his young mistress and aspirant actress. His wife's cat avenges her. Finally, Gray leaves the manuscript of his book with Richards, but on the way home he too is killed by a group of cats. Richards' own feline pet compels him to burn the book , before making him get a bowl of milk. 'I can't deny you anything, can I,' says Richards, fondly.
