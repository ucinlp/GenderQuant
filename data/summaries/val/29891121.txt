Wanted by the law for a murder in a bar, Brett Murphy, a war veteran, has fled the country to Spain, where he has been living for two years and is engaged to wed Jean Gurney, a former showgirl. FBI Agent Stafford arrives in Spain to arrest Brett and bring him back to the U.S. On their commercial flight to New York, the passengers include Jean, who bought a ticket at the last minute, and Lord Leverett, a man deranged by his daughter's death. Leverett brings aboard a chemical poison hidden in his bag. The handcuffed Brett is given a few minutes by Stafford to explain to Jean about his past life. His story is that two men killed a bartender, knocked him out and placed the gun in his hand. Certain he'd never get a fair trial, Brett ran away. A minister on board marries Brett to Jean with the agent's permission. Brett steals a pistol from a partner of Stafford's who is asleep. He tells Jean he intends to hijack the plane to Canada to avoid going to jail. The poison leaks from Leverett's case, emitting toxic fumes that cause a fire in the cabin and kill the pilots and navigator. Former combat pilot Brett is asked to fly the plane. He must make an emergency landing on water and without a radio, which Leverett has damaged. Brett ends up shooting Leverett, whereupon a grateful Stafford still insists on being given the gun. Brett takes pity on the dying passengers and lands the jet. Authorities on the ground inform Stafford that another man is being charged with the bar murder and Brett will be cleared.
