The film begins with sisters Kayla  and Tanya  moving down from Newcastle to start a new life away from their father. Meanwhile, underground boss Trey  has tasked his female companion Shaks  to take out a crackhead who has fallen behind on the payments for her gear. On her way home from a day's shopping, Kayla is attacked on the bus by two men. However, she manages to escape from harm after the two men are beaten up by Danielle  and her crew. After her ordeal, Kayla decides to return home, instead of meeting her sister as planned for a meal in a cafe. As Tanya leaves the cafe, she finds Trey attacking Shaks for not confronting the crackhead, and warns him to back off. Instead, Trey pounces on her and strangles her to death. Worrying that Kayla will reveal the identity of her sister's killer to the police, Trey sends his men to take her out. Realising that she is slowly running out of options, Kayla realises her only hope of survival is to get in tow with Danielle and her crew - but could her new friendship cost Danielle's life?
