The film shows the high level of personal expression that typically goes into independent games, through the story of three games: Braid was released in 2008, Super Meat Boy was preparing for its 2011 release, while Fez was struggling with development hell for several years. Braid developer Jonathan Blow recounts his thought process for the game: how he wished to put his "deepest flaws and vulnerabilities" into it and how his initial design experience quickly turned from experimentation to discovery. He also talks about the aftermath of the game: When Braid comes out, it receives widespread critical acclaim, but Blow is disillusioned, when a large portion of players don't "get" the underlying message and themes of the game. He makes attempts to influence the audience's impression of the game through forum posts and blog comments, but this eventually turns him into something of a comic figure, something which he feels uncomfortable with. The game, however, remains a commercial and critical success. Super Meat Boy developers Team Meat  set out to do a platform game that harkens back to their own childhood video game experiences. McMillen talks about his lifelong goal of communicating to others through his work. He goes on to talk about his 2008 game Aether that chronicles his childhood feelings of loneliness, nervousness, and fear of abandonment.{{cite web}} He also sheds light on the level design techniques he uses, on how he teaches players to play without extensive tutorials. About a year into development, Microsoft offers Team Meat a chance to take part in an Xbox Live Arcade promotion called "Game Feast", under the condition that they finish the game in a month, which they reluctantly accept because of their dire financial situation. The development goes into crunch time, and takes its toll on McMillen's marriage, and on Refenes' health, who bears the brunt of the work. Refenes also laments how he sacrificed his social life to get the game done, but expresses gratitude for his family to be supportive of his goal. The team successfully delivers the game, but come release day, the game is nowhere to be found on Xbox Live, which greatly upsets Refenes, who predicts low sales as a result. The game, however, does eventually appear on the marketplace, and doubles Braid's sales by selling 20000 units on the first 24 hours. McMillen is surprised by both the sales and touched by the fan reaction, and although Refenes, exhausted and cynical, is less enthusiastic, he eventually relents when he first sees videos of people enjoying the game on YouTube. The game eventually goes on to sell a million copies, providing a level of financial security to both developers. FEZ developers Polytron ([[Phil Fish  are in the fourth year of the game's development: the game was first announced at IGF 2008, which thrust Fish into the limelight as an "indie developer celebrity", but little was heard of the game since. The development is troubled: The company loses funding, Fish encounters family problems, and his former business partner quits the company, engaging in a legal battle with Fish, which questions the future of the project. Fish himself admits to his perfectionism protracting the development, as well as losing perspective over time about how good the game really is. Similar to Refenes, Fish also notes that he doesn't see himself doing anything else other than indie games, saying that FEZ has become his identity over time. Polytron prepares to present FEZ at Penny Arcade Expo, despite the possibility of the lawsuit lingering. This causes Fish to suffer anxiety attacks over the course of the preparation; without his business partner  signing his side of the final deal, he could potentially block Polytron from presenting at PAX. The FEZ kiosk is set up nevertheless, but the show runs into problems, when last minute changes in the build cause the game to often hang up or crash, forcing Fish to occasionally restart the game. The players, however, are unfazed and continue to enjoy the game nevertheless; Fish gives a number of interviews, and Jerry Holkins expresses his excitement about the product as well. Towards the closing of the show, Fish's new partner Ken Schachter announces that he and the former business partner had a meeting and have come to an agreement, which relieves Fish, who in the end is satisfied with the results of the show, and vows to continue working on the game and releasing it in 2012. The film bookends itself with Jonathan Blow's opening monologue about how indie gaming differs by offering flaws and vulnerabilities, making the games more personal. During the closing credits, videos of other upcoming indie games are interspersed.
