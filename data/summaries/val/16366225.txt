Giuseppe  and Yousef  are two fishermen bound by a long friendship. Giuseppe, an Italian, and Yousef, an Arab, both work together on the same boat. Out at sea, the two share everything, even the same first name. One day, Giuseppe hears a disturbing report on the ship's radio. The report is a warning about a suspected terrorist who happens to have the same name as Giuseppe's trusted partner: Yousef Ben Ali. Giuseppe suspects that he is being double-crossed by his once faithful friend. A cat-and-mouse game ensues, as the two try to outwit each other aboard the ship, alone in the middle of the sea.
