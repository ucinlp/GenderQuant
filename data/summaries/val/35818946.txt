Machete is recruited by the President of the United States for a mission which would be impossible for any mortal man. Machete must battle his way through Mexico to take down a cartel leader, Mendez the Madman, who threatens to fire a missile on the US. Machete foils Mendez's plot only to find that the missiles are remote wired to and triggered by the madmanâ€™s still beating heart. The only man who can disarm the missile is eccentric billionaire arms dealer, Luther Voz, who has hatched a plan of his own to spread war across the planet with a weapon in space. Machete takes on Voz and his army in order to dismantle his master plan for global anarchy".
