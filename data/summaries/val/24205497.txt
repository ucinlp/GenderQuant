One stormy night, Donald and his nephews overhear the radio announcer, Breckenridge, state a terrible killer gorilla named Ajax has escaped from the local zoo. As a joke, Donald scares his nephews with fur gloves to make it seem he is Ajax. To get revenge on their uncle, the nephews dress up in a gorilla suit and frighten Donald, just before Ajax breaks into the house. After the gorilla chases Donald through his old house, with the help of the radio, the nephews use tear gas to stop Ajax, also making Donald cry.
