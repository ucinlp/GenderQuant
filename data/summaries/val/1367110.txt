Lovers and Other Strangers revolves around the wedding of Mike  and Susan , intercutting their story with those of other couples among their families and friends. As the movie opens, Mike wants to call off the wedding, arguing that it would be hypocritical for them to get married when they've already been living together for a year and a half. He only relents when Susan's father, Hal , tells him how Susan went to her first Halloween party dressed as a bride. Over the course of the movie, we meet: * Susan's WASP-ish parents, Hal and Bernice . Hal, we learn, is having a long-running extramarital affair with Bernice's sister, Kathy , who is afraid of being left as a spinster and is using the wedding to get some commitment from Hal. * Susan's sister, Wilma , and her husband Johnny . With two children, Wilma is feeling her age and misses the passion they had at the beginning of their marriage, while Johnny is more interested in watching Spellbound on TV than giving his wife attention. * Mike's brother, Richie  and his wife, Joan , who have grown "incompatible" and "unhappy" and are considering divorce. * Bridesmaid Brenda  and usher Jerry , who Mike and Susan "fix up" for the wedding. Nebbishy Jerry imagines himself a playboy, and spends most of the weekend trying to "score" with Brenda. * Mike's Italian-American parents, Frank  and Bea , who are relentlessly trying to persuade Richie and Joan not to get divorced.  All the plot lines play out through the rehearsal, wedding, and reception.
