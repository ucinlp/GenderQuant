Waitress-turned-Broadway star Mabel O'Dare  and garage-mechanic-turned-prize fighter Larry Cain  dislike each other intensely, but press agent Aloysius K. Reilly  cooks up a phony romance between them for publicity. Inevitably, the two fall in love for real, and plan on getting married, with Mabel quitting show business to be a housewife and Cain quitting the fight racket to run garages in New Jersey. When their entourages get wind of their plan, they plant the story in the newspapers, and each thinks the other one betrayed their secret - until Mabel's aunt  tells Mabel the truth. Mabel abandons her show and rushes to Philadelphia were Cain is fighting. Having been told by his manager that Mabel is going to marry crooner Ronny Caudwell , an enraged Cain is waging an all-out fight against his opponent, until he hears Mabel's voice and is knocked down. Reilly confesses to Cain that he was the one who leaked the story, and Cain's second, DoDo  accidentally throws a towel into the ring, making Cain the loser by a technical knockout. But since Mabel has bet on the other boxer, the newly reunited couple will have a tidy nest egg to start their new life together.
