The Pink Panther purchases a hilltop plot, building a house that by coincidence lies between an astronomical observatory and the moon. Pink and the astronomer soon engage in a battle with one another, with Pink defending himself against an intrusive telescope. Eventually the astronomer turns his telescope into a cannon, which backfires, ejecting the astronomer onto the moon. Pink is then seen charging visitors a token fee to view his former nemesis on the moon through his home telescope.
