Carlito  leads a wealthy and influential Mexican-American crime syndicate in Los Angeles. Worried about encroachment from a Chinese syndicate, Carlito orders the contract killing of their leader, Don Kim . Carlito's best hitman, a British man called Chev Chelios , is given the job. However, after the hit, the anger of the Chinese is much greater than Carlito expected. Carlito regrets the hit, deeming it "ill-advised". Carlito tells the Chinese the hit had nothing to do with him, and he will remove the elements in his own organization who were responsible. Ricky Verona , a small time criminal and long-time rival of Chelios, uses the opportunity to conspire with Carlito against Chelios. While Chelios sleeps in his apartment, Verona breaks in and injects Chelios with a synthetic drug  inhibiting the flow of adrenaline, slowing the heart and eventually killing the victim. Chelios wakes to find a recorded video explaining that Chelios should have about an hour left before the poison stops his heart. Chelios phones Doc Miles , a personal physician to the Mafia, who informs Chelios that in order to survive he must keep his adrenaline pumping through constant excitement and danger, or get some artificial adrenaline, epinephrine. With his own adrenaline keeping the poison at bay at first, Chelios breaks into a hospital and steals numerous drugs, much more than Doc Miles advises him to take and also gets "juiced" by hits from a defibrilator. He also keeps his adrenaline up through reckless and dangerous acts like picking fights with other gangsters, stealing things, committing robberies, fighting with police, having sex with his girlfriend in public and driving a car through a shopping mall. The entire film takes place in a single day, on November 7, 2005, over the course of which Chelios sets out to find Verona and his street gang through Chelios' street contact Kaylo , a flamboyant homosexual. Chelios also picks up his girlfriend Eve  before Verona's thugs get to her. Chelios attempts to sexually assault Eve while she strongly resists in the middle of a busy street in Chinatown, while hundreds of people look on, in order to keep his adrenaline up; she eventually appears to consent and they proceed to have sex, still amidst a crowd of onlookers.http://voices.yahoo.com/sex-scene-criticism-crank-starring-jason-statham-and-1677953.html Sullivan, Michael. "Sex Scene Criticism: Crank, Starring Jason Statham and Amy Smart." Retrieved May 4, 2012 from Yahoo! Voices It’s eventually revealed that Chelios spared Don Kim's life and told him to leave LA. Chelios arranges a rooftop meeting with Carlito, Verona, and their henchmen, who promise him a fake antidote. Don Kim arrives along with his Triads to assist Chelios, and a shootout follows, killing many of Carlito’s men. Carlito himself is killed by Verona, who then tries to leave in Carlito's helicopter. The film concludes with Chelios' confronting Verona in the helicopter, out of which they both fall over the course of battle. Chelios breaks Verona's neck mid-air and, still falling, calls Eve on his cell phone, to apologize for not coming back. Chelios hits a car, bounces off it and lands right in front of the camera. In the last shot, it is implied that his adrenaline is indeed still flowing fast; his nostrils flare, he blinks, and two heartbeats are heard.
