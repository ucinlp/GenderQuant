The Pink Panther embarks on a cruise to the South Seas for 14 days, but the luxurious holiday turns out to be a pirate ship operated by a merciless pirate who orders the panther to mop the deck. The panther accidentally sets fire to the mast, and later loads cannonballs incorrectly, causing the ship's weight to shift. Finally, when the pirate tries to kill a vicious shark with a cannon, the cannonball instead cracks a hole in the ship and it sinks.
