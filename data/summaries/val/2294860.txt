Nicky Wilson  and Oscar Sullivan  are inept 1920's scam artists who see pay dirt in the guise of Fredericka Quintessa Bigard , the millionaire heiress to a sanitary napkin fortune. She is in love with the already married Nicky, but because the Mann Act prohibits him from taking her across state lines and then engaging in immoral relations, he proposes she marry Oscar and then carry on an affair with the man she really wants. Oscar, who is wanted for embezzlement and anxious to get out of town, is happy to comply with the plan, although he intends to claim his spousal privileges after they are wed. Once they reach Los Angeles, the two men try everything they can to separate Freddie from her inheritance, without success but with enough determination to arouse her suspicions. When she announces she plans to donate all her money to charity, Nicky and Oscar panic and come to the conclusion murder might be their only recourse if they're going to achieve their goal.
