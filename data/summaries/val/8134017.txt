Topsy ([[Steve Gunderson  and Bunker , two outcasts living in a run-down, fleabag hotel in pre-Giuliani New York. Ensconced in their Manhattan neighborhood, where the present seemingly is out of sync with the overarching, socially defined reality of The City at large, the two misfits pass the time of their times in a fugue. Weaving fantasies of ever more complicated deviousness, they are shocked when, one night, one of their mind games goes horribly wrong and results in the death of Grace , one of the locals. Now, try as they might, the exigenices of reality won't leave Topsy and Bunker alone. A reckoning is coming: but when the whole world is in your head, where do you hide?
