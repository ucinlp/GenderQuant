Packard Walsh  is the ruthless leader of a gang that steals the cars of people they threaten into intimidation races. The entire town fears him, including his girlfriend, Keri Johnson , whom he sees as his own property. She actually doesn't love him and stays with him out of fear, so he won't harm her. The town knows he killed Jamie Hankins, Keri's former boyfriend, but the police cannot solve the murder due to the missing body. Packard controls the town with his power. As Packard organizes the races in the outskirts of the town, his tyrannical control of the races is suddenly at risk when a black Dodge M4S Turbo Interceptor called The Wraith arrives in town. The driver of this car is covered from head to toe in a racing helmet and black body armor that conceals his identity. The armor is adorned with metal braces resembling those worn by victims recovering from severe physical trauma. He starts to appear at Packard's races, where he kills gang members, starting with Oggie , and then Skank . Sheriff Loomis  tries to investigate the Turbo Interceptor, but the unidentified driver is impossible to find, showing only on races organized by Packard. Meanwhile, a young visitor named Jake Kesey  shows up on his dirt bike to stay in town for a while. He quickly befriends Keri and also Billy Hankins , Jamie's brother, who works at Big Kay's, the local burger shack. Jake has multiple scars around his neck and body, which he keeps as a secret. Keri becomes interested in him. As Packard's gang grows smaller with each death, Rughead , the gang's geek who organizes races and who did not participate in Jamie's murder, realizes that the gang is being targeted because of the murder and quits the gang in fear of his life. Keri herself is suspicious of who Jake is. When she confronts him over this, he tells her to ask Packard, explaining that Packard knows why Jake is here. Jake says that he has come a long way for Keri and his time is just about over. Packard, now the last member of his disbanded gang, confronts Keri at Big Kay's over her association with Jake and forces her to leave with him. When Billy attempts to intervene, Packard beats him and kidnaps Keri, telling her that they're going to flee to California. When she confronts him with the knowledge that it was he who murdered Jamie, he becomes physically abusive and tells her that she belongs to him. As he stops the car and pulls a switchblade on her, they are confronted by the Turbo Interceptor, who challenges Packard to a race. As with the others, Packard dies in a fiery explosion. With no members of Packard's gang left alive , Sheriff Loomis ends both the investigation and the pursuit of the Turbo Interceptor. As Keri arrives home that night, the Turbo Interceptor pulls up to the curb and a driver emerges, who reveals himself to be Jake. Jake tells an incredulous Keri that his new body was the closest he could get to being Jamie again and tells her that they were destined to be together. He then asks her to wait for him because he has one last thing to take care of. Jake goes to Big Kay's, accidentally scaring Billy. He calms Billy down and gives him the keys to the Turbo Interceptor, the only one of its kind, telling him that his work here is finished, and that "there are instructions in the glove compartment." When Billy asks, "Who are you, bro?", Jake replies, "You said it, Billy." As Jake rides off on his dirt bike, Billy comes to the realization that Jake is in fact his older brother Jamie. Jake picks up Keri, who was being watched by Sheriff Loomis, and together they ride off into the night on his dirt bike.
