British writer James Miller  is in Tuscany to give a talk about his new book, titled "Certified Copy", which argues that, in art, issues of authenticity are irrelevant, because every reproduction is itself an original and even the original is a copy of another form. A French antiques dealer, whose name is never given , attends the talk with her 11-year-old son in order to have Miller sign the copies she has bought of the book, but has to leave early because her son is hungry. She drops off her phone number with Miller's translator. Miller and the woman then meet at her shop, and Miller suggests they get out and see some of the countryside. The woman drives them around aimlessly while Miller signs the books, and they talk about the book's subject. They then visit a museum, and the woman gets increasingly distraught as she complains about her rebellious son and Miller seems to defend her son's behavior. They then go to a cafe. Miller steps out to take a phone call, and the woman who runs the cafe, thinking Miller is the woman's husband, gets into a conversation with the woman about marriage and about him specifically. After Miller returns and the two leave the cafe, the nature of their discussion changes: they start to speak in a combination of French and English instead of just English , and, more unexpectedly, they now speak as if they truly are a married couple, who have been married for 15 years, and the son is both of theirs. It is left unclear which, if either, is the true reality of the film.
