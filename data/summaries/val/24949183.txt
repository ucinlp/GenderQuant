The story is set in Istanbul, during the Pogrom of September 1955. Behçet  is the only son of a father, in whom the government and the bureaucracy take a close interest due to his strong influence in Antakya. While he is working as an assistant researcher in the faculty of law in Istanbul, he falls under the sway of the extreme nationalist movement as a result of his upbringing and the influential role model of his father. The only thing that causes Behçet to stumble on this is Elena, a woman he secretly observes from his apartment. She is a Greek prostitute, who has been exploited by her grandmother after her mother had left them. Elena is aware that she is being observed by Behçet and falls in love with him. They get close to each other which does not please Behçet's father and his political party. The death of his friend Suat and the role that his father plays with the leaders of the party to exterminate the opposition and even the tolerated voices force Behçet to reconsider his political belonging. Behçet finds Elena alive after being hit by the activist. He takes her and remembers the words she said while lying on the bed in her apartment.
