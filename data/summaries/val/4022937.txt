The film's narrative consists of several interwoven subplots taking place in the town of Northfork, Montana circa 1955. A new dam is being built which will flood the valley of Northfork, and the town is in the midst of an evacuation. The narratives focus on several individuals who, for one reason or another, have yet to evacuate. Walter O'Brian  and his son  are on the evacuation team, helping to evacuate the last few inhabitants of Northfork. Father Harlan  is one such individual, who has stayed behind to care for Irwin , a dying orphan too weak to leave town. While the O'Brians and their co-workers encounter an array of unusual characters, Irwin discovers that he is the "unknown angel" and finds himself a family in his dreams.
