Alisa Selezneva joins an archeological expedition to the dead planet of Coleida. There are well-preserved cities from the past, yet all of planet's inhabitants had died centuries ago due to unknown plague. Using a time-travelling device, Alisa and an alien scientist Rrrr, who looks almost exactly as a cat, travel to the planet's past, to the day the plague begun. They find themselves in a world that resembles XX century Earth, Soviet Union in particular. Coleidians are expecting return of their cosmonauts from their first trip to another planet. Alisa realizes that the cosmonauts were the cause of the plague, and decides to prevent it. Through numerous obstacles, she comes close to the returned spaceship and uses a desinfection spray to prevent plague from spreading. To coleidian police, it looks like an assault, so they catch Alisa and imprison her. With Rrrr's help, she's able to escape and return back to the future. Upon arrival, they find that the future changed and Coleida is no more a dead planet, but a flourishing civilisation.
