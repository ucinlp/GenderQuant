Militants storm the U.S. embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979 in retaliation for the country's support of the recently deposed Shah. Before the militants enter the building, the staff attempts to destroy the classified documents held in the embassy. They burn and shred most of it before the rioters enter. Although most of the embassy staff are taken as hostages, six evade capture and hide in the home of Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor . With the escapees' situation kept secret, the State Department begins to explore options for "exfiltrating" them from Iran. CIA specialist Tony Mendez , brought in for consultation, points out the fundamental weaknesses in all of the proposals for how to do so, but is at a loss to suggest an alternative until he gets an idea while watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes on TV with his son: create a cover story that the escapees are Canadian filmmakers, scouting "exotic" locations in Iran for a similar film. Mendez and his supervisor Jack O'Donnell  contact John Chambers , a Hollywood make-up artist who has previously crafted disguises for the CIA in addition to his work in the Apes film series. Chambers puts them in touch with film producer Lester Siegel . Together they set up a phoney film studio and successfully establish the pretense of developing Argo, a "science fantasy" in the style of Star Wars, to lend credibility to the cover story. Meanwhile, the escapees grow frantic inside the ambassador's residence. Shredded documentation from the US embassy is being reassembled, providing the revolutionaries with evidence that there are embassy personnel unaccounted for. Posing as a producer for Argo, Mendez enters Iran and links up with the six escapees, providing them with Canadian passports and extensive information about their fake identities to help them convincingly bluff their way through security at the airport. Although they are afraid to trust Mendez's scheme, they reluctantly agree to go along with it, knowing that Mendez is risking his own life too, and convinced that it is their only option. A "scouting" visit to the bazaar to maintain their cover story takes a bad turn, but Mendez gets them away from the hostile crowd. Mendez is informed that the operation has been cancelled, to avoid conflicting with a planned military rescue of the hostages. He pushes ahead nevertheless, forcing O'Donnell to hastily demand of his superiors to reactivate logistical support. At the airport there is tension as the escapees' flight reservations are only confirmed at the last minute and a call to the supposed studio in Hollywood at first goes unanswered. The group boards the plane, just as the revolutionaries uncover the ruse and hastily attempt to stop them. To protect the hostages remaining in Tehran from further retaliation, all US involvement in the caper is suppressed, giving full credit to the Canadian government and its ambassador . Mendez is awarded the Intelligence Star, but due to the classified nature of the mission, he would not be able to keep the medal until the details were made public in 1997. All the hostages are later freed on January 20, 1981. The film ends with Jimmy Carter giving a speech about the Crisis and the Canadian Caper, with screenshots from the film being contrasted with images of the actual people and events during the crisis.
