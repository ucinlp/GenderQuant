Chris Farraday  is an ex-smuggler who now has a peaceful life with his wife, Kate , and their two sons in New Orleans. They learn that Kate's brother Andy  was smuggling drugs, but dropped them into the Mississippi River during a surprise inspection by U.S. Customs. Andy's boss, ruthless mobster Tim Briggs , threatens to kill Chris' family if Andy doesn't pay $700,000. Chris decides to raise the money by running contraband, working with his best friend and former smuggling partner, Sebastian Abney ([[Ben Foster , who has also gone legit and now owns a construction company. He promises Kate that he will not run drugs, joining the crew of a cargo ship in order to buy $10,000,000 in fake bills in Panama and smuggle them into the U.S. He is joined by Andy, good friend Danny Raymer , and gets help from fellow crew mates. Briggs breaks into Chris's house to scare his wife and kids, so they move into Sebastian's house for safety. In Panama, Chris discovers that the bills are of poor quality and refuses to accept them. The only one who can provide good ones is crime lord Gonzalo . While Chris and Danny negotiate with Gonzalo, Briggs calls Andy and threatens to kill one of Chris' sons if Andy doesn't immediately take Chris' money and use it to buy cocaine. Gonzalo lets Chris and Danny help in a dangerous armored car heist as payment for the fake bills. They are successful in stealing a paint splattered tarp in the heist, but Gonzalo and his men are killed in a firefight with the police. Chris and Danny make it back to the ship yard in a van containing the fake bills and the tarp. They load the contraband-laden van into a container which is loaded onto their cargo ship. Chris assaults Andy for stealing the money and buying cocaine. It is revealed that Sebastian has been working with Briggs, as gangster Jim Church  threatens to kill Sebastian if he doesn't repay money he borrowed to save his fledgling construction business. When Sebastian calls Chris, Chris tells him that he might drop the drugs Andy bought into the ocean. Sebastian tells Briggs, who assaults Kate and warns her to tell Chris to not dump the "package". Kate calls Chris and tells him what Briggs said to her. Chris is surprised that Briggs knew about dumping the drugs, realizing that Sebastian had to have told him. Kate does not know and goes back to Sebastian's apartment to retrieve some personal items. When Sebastian tries to force himself on her, Kate runs to the bathroom. Sebastian breaks the door open, sending Kate flying and bashing her head against the tub. Sebastian thinks she is dead and panics, wraps her in plastic, and throws Kate's unconscious body in a yet to be poured foundation. Sebastian contacts the cargo ship's Captain Camp , tells him that Chris is smuggling on his ship, and promises him a share if he makes sure Chris doesn't throw it overboard. When Chris does not give up the contraband, Camp calls U.S. Customs to meet the ship in New Orleans. The Customs Agents do not find anything other than the van, containing only the paint splattered tarp. Briggs and his thugs force Chris to take them to the drugs. Chris takes Briggs to Camp's house, having made a duplicate key while on the ship, and knowingly activates the security system. Chris opens Camp's personal carpet cleaner, which the Captain had aboard the ship, and retrieves the cocaine from the carpet cleaner's water tank. While Briggs and his gang sit in Camp's living room with the cocaine, Chris sneaks out in Camp's car. Camp awakens to the noise and comes into the living room as the police arrive. Both Briggs and Camp are arrested. Chris goes to Sebastian's construction site and brutally beats him, demanding Kate's location. When Sebastian tells Chris that she's dead, he tries calling her cellphone and hears the ringtone in a building foundation where cement is being poured and rescues her. Sebastian is arrested and sent to prison. Danny retrieves the fake bills, which we learn Chris had dumped into the Mississippi River before docking in New Orleans. Andy buys the escape van, still containing the tarp, at a police auction. Church pays Chris $3 million for the fake currency. and asks if he knows anything about a Jackson Pollock painting stolen from an armored car in Panama, telling him that it's worth over $20 million on the black market. Chris, Andy and Danny find the tarp/painting still in the van, having gone unnoticed. The film ends with Chris and his family in a waterfront house.
