Two lovers, Knock Knock  and Who's There  confront their difficulties communicating with each other by telling knock knock jokes. Rather than being puns, as knock knock jokes in the usual sense, the jokes are intended to invoke a sense of postmodern thought, for example, "Knock knock", "Who's there?", "Not only not no one, not even not he" . The third member of the love triangle, Vin Knight  enters, and the tension rises. The film ends with Knock Knock asking "Don't you understand that communication is impossible?" and Who's There answering "No".
