Set in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, Buchan leaves his farm in Zambia in the midst of political unrest and racially charged land reclaims and travels south with his family to start a better life. With nothing more than a caravan on a patch of land, and help from his foreman, Simeon Bhengu, the Buchan family struggles to settle in a new country. Faced with ever mounting challenges, hardships and personal turmoil, Buchan quickly spirals down into a life consumed by anger, fear and destruction. Finally, his wife convinces him to attend a local church, where the testimonies of other farmers influence his decision to give his life to Jesus Christ. His outlook takes a complete turnaround, and supernatural occurrences begin to happen when Angus prays in faith. He begins giving his testimony in different towns, and eventually gathers thousands of people in Kings Park Stadium for a time of unified prayer for the nation and for the land. Traditionally a maize and cattle farmer, Buchan decides to plant potatoes. Scientists had warned the farmers not to plant that season unless they had irrigation. Because of the unprecedented drought, planting potatoes would be a massive risk. Believing he is led by the Lord, he plants potatoes in the dry dust. When harvest time comes, there is a crop of giant potatoes.
