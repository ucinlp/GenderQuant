Johnny and Adam are teenage surfers who reside in Los Angeles with their father Mac. Two weeks before Johnny's 16th birthday, ninjas attack the teenagers, but they are stopped by Zatch, a warrior with an eye patch. A follow-up attack results in the kidnapping of Mac, while Zatch is able to get the teenagers and their friend Iggy away from the ninjas. Adam discovers that the video game on his Sega Game Gear correlates with the events happening around him and that he can control some events through his console. Safely away from the ninjas, Zatch reveals to Johnny and Adam that they are the sons of the king of Patusan, whose land and monarchy was overthrown by Colonel Chi when the boys were young. Zatch tells them that it is their destiny to return to Patusan, overthrow Colonel Chi, and rescue the population. Zatch takes the boys to the Patusani district in Los Angeles, the home of refugees from Chi's rule. Johnny is introduced to a Patusani princess, Ro-May, who has been betrothed to Johnny since childhood. Ninjas attack the group again, and Johnny finds his inherent abilities as a warrior prince emerge, successfully defeating several foes. With the ninjas dispatched, Johnny, Adam, Iggy, Zatch, and Ro-May decide to travel to Patusan. They are followed by a detective, Lieutenant Spence, who had been investigating the ninja attacks on the boys. The group reaches Patusan and see the effects of Colonel Chi's rule, including a burned village and a Patusani chain gang monitored by Chi's henchmen. When Adam and Spence inadvertently fall into the sight of the henchmen, the group is forced to fight them. The henchmen are defeated, and the villagers are freed from the chain gang. Zatch then leads the group to uncover a hidden cave in which the weapons of the Patusani monarchy are stored. Using his Game Gear and being helped by a monkey, Adam is able to uncover the cave for the group. In the cave, Zatch arms Johnny and attacks him in a tribulation to prepare the boy for future challenges. Johnny is beaten down repeatedly, but he is able to achieve the upper hand and disarm Zatch. The group rallies the villagers to overthrow Colonel Chi, and they travel to the shore of the mainland across from an island that is the home to the royal city and Chi's dungeon. Unable to take a boat to the unprotected side of the island due to an impassable reef, Johnny and Adam tell the Patusanis, who are expert at wood carving, to carve surfboards. With everyone equipped with their own surfboard, they swim to the unprotected side. After landing at the island, Johnny and Zatch lead the attack on the royal city, taking down Chi's henchmen. Johnny and Adam's adoptive father Mac is freed, and Johnny confronts Colonel Chi, successfully defeating him  with the help of Adam and his Game Gear. With Chi's rule undone, peace is restored to Patusan. Johnny is seated as the heralded warrior prince with Ro-May as his princess and Adam as a prince. Johnny declares for the monarchy to be dissolved and announces that Patusan would operate as a democracy under the people.
