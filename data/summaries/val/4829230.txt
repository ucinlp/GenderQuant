In 1813 London, a Swiss father, William Robinson ([[Thomas Mitchell , wishes to escape the influence of the superficial profligacy of London on his family. His eldest son, Fritz , is obsessed with Napoleon, whom he considers his hero. His middle son, Jack , is a foolish dandy who cares only about fashion and money. And his dreamy son Ernest  is preoccupied with reading and writing to the exclusion of all else. William Robinson sells his business and house, in order to move with his wife and four sons to Australia. They set out on a brig bound for the faraway country. Following a long voyage, the family is shipwrecked on a remote deserted island after the captain and crew are washed overboard during a storm. The family members collaborate to create a home for themselves in the alien jungle environment. They gradually learn to use the unfamiliar plants and animals to create what they need to live and thrive. They have many adventures and challenges and make many discoveries. The mother , however, misses her elegant home and community in England, and wishes to somehow be rescued and return. The father slowly convinces her that living in the natural environment is better for the family and that they are meant to be there.
