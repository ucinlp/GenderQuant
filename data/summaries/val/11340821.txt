Mammy dresses up before preparing to leave for the Lucky Seven Saturday Night Bridge Club. As she leaves, Tom was very happy and rushes to the living room window. He whistles to Butch, Lightning and Topsy to get their attention and rush in when Tom gives them the all-clear by showing them a sign reading O.K. FOR THE PARTY and start to play loud jazz music. Also, Tom gives sandwiches to Lightning and Topsy and pie for Butch.  But the noise has disrupted Jerry from getting his beauty sleep. Unsurprisingly, his complaints to Tom fall upon unsympathetic ears and meet with no success. Jerry's being outmaneuvered by the four cats, so he attempts to disrupt the proceedings personally. Unfortunately, now the cats do not appreciate Jerry's desperate acts and go on the warpath. The party soon starts up again after Jerry flees into his mouse hole  before Jerry pulls the plug on the phonograph and Topsy begins the chase again, trying to flatten Jerry but instead getting four taunting caricatures of Jerry imprinted on the trash can lid. Jerry sees the other cats approaching and flees through an open 2-section door, closing the top section such that all three cats run into it. Jerry runs into Topsy coming from the other direction as he rounds a corner, so he hides behind the curtain and steals the lid. Topsy then runs back the other way, but runs into his own lid. The chase then resumes again, eventually leading Jerry into Tom's trap which causes Jerry to be squished and Tom proceeds to tie him up with the windowsill string before he and the other ally cats start to play the loud jazz music once again. Jerry has had enough, so he swings down to the nearest table and uses the telephone to report Tom's activities to Mammy Two Shoes. Mammy is seen playing bridge with her friends when Jerry calls and tells her about Tom's party. She races back home  and crashes through the wall. When Tom opens the door and sees Mammy and points at him "Thomas!", the cats run away, but unfortunately for Tom, Mammy grabs his tail and throws the cats into a street wall, forming a totem pole. Mammy is upset over the fact that the cats ruined her entire evening. But to Jerry's dismay, she decides to relax by playing the same jazz recording that the cats were playing, leaving Jerry no better than before.
