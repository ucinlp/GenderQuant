A couple, Sudheer  and Rani , is traveling in a car on a deserted road for friendâ€™s marriage. They take a short cut to reach the venue when their car conks out and they end up in an old, dilapidated and a seedy resort. They meet a weird hotel staff member, Subbaraju, who claims that he is The Receptionist. He tells them that the hotel is full. Another guy, who calls himself The Manager , tells them that one room is vacant and they are allotted room number 8. Inside the hotel Sudheer and Rani realize that the room has not been cleaned for many days. When they order for lunch, the resort staff bring the menu but they say that nothing is available. Sudheer shouts at the hotel staff and they tell him that he can take their car and drive to a nearby village where he can get a mechanic but they tell him that he cannot take his wife along with him. Sudheer gets irritated and asks them to get out. Soon, both hear some weird sounds from the next room. But to their surprise that adjacent room is locked. Sudheer slowly starts realizing that he and Rani are getting more and more trapped in a do or die situation. When asked The Receptionist tells them that the source of the sound from the neighboring room is a Ghost. But The Manager says it is not a ghost but a thief. Frightened at their gestures, Sudheer and Rani try to get out of the resort, but the manager, receptionist and a servant  hold them captive and keep Rani in room number 9 - the same room as the one with the Ghost. However, Sudheer and Rani manage to escape from them but are trapped in the same building. The three men at the resort are actually kidnappers working for a don who calls himself Munna Bhai. They have kidnapped a businessman Narayana Murthy  and locked him up in room number 9. To solve the kidnap mystery cops Shiva  and Richard ([[Sunil  arrive at the resort feigning to convey the message that Munna Bhai has been arrested. What ensues now is a game of hide and seek as Sudheer, Rani and Narayana Murthy are now on the run. Finally, Prakash Raj arrives as a cop-on-duty to arrest The Mutha, later revealing himself to be the don Munna Bhai, the mastermind behind the kidnap.
