Representative Jack Tanner of Michigan ([[Michael Murphy  is an obscure liberal Democratic politician who struggles to find a voice in the early 1988 Democratic primaries. His campaign manager, T.J. Cavanaugh , uses an unscripted, impassioned hotel-room speech caught on camera as part of an advertising campaign focusing on Tanner's authenticity and integrity. Using the slogan "For Real", Tanner emerges from a wide field of contenders to battle for the nomination against two high-profile and better-funded candidates: Jesse Jackson and eventual nominee Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. With Tanner are his college-aged daughter Alexandra , whose illness was why he earlier left politics and who has left college for the duration of the campaign, and his girlfriend Joanna Buckley , Dukakis' deputy campaign manager. Others who appear on camera are Emile Berkoff , a compulsive statistician with a crush on Alexandra; Deke Conners , an EEast Village filmmaker hired to produce Tanner campaign ads; and Andrea Spinelli , T.J.'s innocent and ditzy but well-meaning assistant. The candidate's father, General John Tanner , who has a contentious relationship with his son, also occasionally appears. Although Tanner does not win the nomination, he does run a serious and credible race. The series ends on a cliffhanger after Dukakis officially becomes the Democratic candidate and Tanner considers a third party run.  Several members of Tanner's prospective cabinet are mentioned, with several making statements to the press accepting the appointment should he become president. Those mentioned include:"Something Borrowed, Something New" * Lee H. Hamilton, Secretary of State * Lee Iacocca, Secretary of Defense * Ralph Nader, Attorney General * Robert Redford, Secretary of the Interior * Jim Hightower, Secretary of Agriculture * Studs Terkel, Secretary of Labor * Gloria Steinem, Secretary of Health and Human Services * Joan Claybrook, Secretary of Transportation * Nicholas von Hoffman, Chairman of the Federal Reserve * Barbara Jordan, Ambassador to the United Nations * Art Buchwald, Ambassador to France
