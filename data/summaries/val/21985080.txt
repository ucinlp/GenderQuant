The film takes place along a stretch of coastline somewhere in Florida in the United States, where a local tourist spot has become plagued by a mysterious marine creature. Little do they know, the monster is the product of a secret military experiment â€” a genetic hybrid mutated from a common octopus and the prehistoric superpredator Dunkleosteus. Unfortunately, the creature has broken loose, and is now feeding on swimmers and tourists swimming or sailing along the coast. And, the monster is only an infant, and will continue to grow if it is left to hunt much longer. A team of scientists led by a scientist named Peter and his colleague, Dr. Stella Dickens are trying to find the creature and stop it, but a group of military scientists are trying to stop them, as the experiment was classified, and it is military business. Both groups are slowly picked off by the creature while they try to track it down. They eventually find that it is hiding in the everglades and manage to corner it in shallow waters and kill it with repeated blasts from flamethrowers. At the end, Peter tells Stella that he has finally decided to take a vacation. When she asks where they are going, he tells her "the mountains". The ending is a freeze frame shot.
