The video features Aaron in concert at Disney MGM Studios performing songs from his 2000 album, Aaron's Party among two others; "Life Is a Party" (from the animated film Rugrats in Paris and on the international edition of the [[Aaron's Party  and a non-album track, "One for the Summer". Disney Channel aired the concert four months before it went to DVD and VHS with the same performance and behind-the-scenes clips of Aaron having fun at Disney World, but it also aired the Samantha Mumba performance at the concert, whereas the DVD omits Mumba performing and adds additional features along with the concert and Disney World clips. The DVD release features footage from the concert including Aaron having fun in Disney World, Aaron's 13th birthday party, Carter recording his then-upcoming album, the music video for "That's How I Beat Shaq" along with a personal greeting from Aaron himself.
