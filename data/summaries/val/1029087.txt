A fictional chemical element called nitron is vanishing from Earth's atmosphere, causing hurricanes and other meteorological disasters. Dr. Zarkov and Flash discover that a raybeam from Mars is the source of the nitron depletion. A dopey newspaper reporter, Happy Hapgood, stows away on their rocket when Flash, Zarkov and Dale Arden go to Mars to investigate. There, they discover that Azura, Queen of Mars, is working with Ming the Merciless to conquer Earth. All of the Martians who oppose her partnership with Ming have been changed into clay humanoids, forced to live underground in caverns beneath Mars' surface. The four earthling take refuge in one of these caverns and team up with the Clay King to destroy the Nitron Lamp that is draining Earth's atmosphere. They also agree to help restore the Clay People to their human form and together, defeat Azura and Ming.
