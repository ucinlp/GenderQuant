Nicholas Orton  is an American businessman who has lived in China for several years. He has a chance encounter with a beautiful Chinese lady  who says that he is the only one who can save the world from reverting back five-hundred years. He is unswayed by this until many modern buildings begin disappearing before his eyes. This mystical lady  transports him to a portal which offers entrance, through the teachings of Confucius , to the ancient Chinese underworld. When Nicholas Orton  reaches the other side of the portal, he finds that his studies of Confucius will come in handy for the path that lies ahead. Nicholas Orton's first action is to rescue Sun Wukong the Monkey King from the mountain which he has been imprisoned in for centuries. Sun Wukong  travels with Nicholas Orton in his quest to save the original manuscript of Journey to the West from destruction. They are later joined by Zhu Bajie  and Sha Wujing  to help them on the way.
