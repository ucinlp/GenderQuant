A boxer from Brooklyn with a bad attitude and a fat belly gets beaten up by an old man. Seeking revenge, he returns to a boxing trainer, played by his real-life coach Paddy Carson, asking his coach to get him in shape so he can beat up the old man. His coach, Patty, tells him, “If an old man beats you, then you must not fight him, you must learn from him.” “As always, I was honored to play in a Khmer movie. I am so grateful for all of the email and support that has come to me from Khmer people around the globe,” says Graceffo, who receives countless emails daily. “The actual acting was pretty funny. I play a big out of shape boxer from Brooklyn. It wasn’t much of a stretch. The story is, in a lot of ways, based on my own experience of coming to Cambodia to train. For example, in the beginning of the film, my character doesn’t speak Khmer, and he gets a little sick when his training brothers ask him to eat spiders. By the end, he gets used to all of that and he learns to respect the spirit of Angkorian warrior.”
