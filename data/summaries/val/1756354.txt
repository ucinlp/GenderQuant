During the Pandavas' Aranyavasa , Arjuna sends his wife Subhadra and their son Abhimanyu to Dwaraka to stay at her maternal home with her brothers, Krishna and Balarama . Sasirekha([[Savitri , Balarama's daughter and Abhimanyu  are deep in love with each other from their childhood. Also at the time of Sasirekha's birth Balarama promises to marry her to Abhimanyu when they grow up. However, Balarama's wife Revathi refuses to honour that commitment, as the Pandavas loose their kingdom and wealth in a gamble with Kauravas and are sent to exile. Balarama instead, on the face of Shakuni's and the Kauravas' cunning persuasion, decides to marry Sasirekha to Lakshmana Kumara , who is the son of his favourite disciple, Duryodhana . Krishna advises Subhadra and Abhimanyu to approach Ghatotkacha . Initially, Ghatotkacha assumes them to be intruders in his forest and attacks them, but later apologizes for his misunderstanding. When Subhadra narrates about what happened of her son and Sasirekha, Ghatotkacha decides to play some trickery in Dwaraka. He first, with the knowledge of Krishna and a servant girl, flies the sleeping Sasirekha along with her bed, from Dwaraka to his forest. Next, using his magical powers, he assumes the form of Sasirekha  and goes back to Dwaraka and wrecks her marriage with Lakshmana Kumara. He also performs some practical jokes and comical acts while in disguise. Also, his retinues act as the marriage overseers and provide comic relief as well. To further break the marriage, Ghatotkacha's follower's  enter the Bridegroom's guest house  and draws hilarious comedy to the audience with Balaiah and Allu Rama Lingaiah. They also create a magical market in Dwaraka to gift the Kauravas and their relatives who come to the marriage with valuable gifts. Meanwhile, back in the forest, the real Sasirekha is married to Abhimanyu. When all goes to plan, Ghatothkacha reveals his true identity and further unveils the true colours of Shakuni and Kauravas. At this point, Sasirekha's parents are convinced of her marriage and decide to bless the newlyweds back at the forest.
