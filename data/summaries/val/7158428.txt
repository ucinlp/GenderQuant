Elmer is a surveyor for a railroad company, and disturbs Bugs' rest by singing "I've Been Wohking on the Wailwoad". Bugs plays tricks on Elmer by making him see lovely ladies and a forest fire through his surveying instructor and in response Elmer gets riled and shoots at him with excessively his shotgun. In between shooting rounds Bugs pulls more annoying pranks on Elmer. When Elmer tries a stick of dynamite on Bugs, Bugs gets Elmer into a football game with the dynamite as the ball, until the it set offs near a Railroad pile of wood which miraculously lays the ties and the track, followed immediately by an engine in full steam, Bugs riding in the back and waving goodbye. Then Bugs jumps off and decides to walk the tracks instead.
