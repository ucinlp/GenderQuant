Newspaper reporter Vanessa Trojan  is sent to "Anywhere, Washington," to do a feature on two female racing legends. When the women, Jo Leene Dodge  and Betty Petty , take her to a rockabilly house party, a glowing light appears in the night sky and people begin to feel ill. The party ends with a huge fight between Jo Leene and her jealous rival Vikki Lee. The next morning Vicki Lee has disappeared, leaving only a few severed fingers on the seat of her car. Jo Leene is accused of her murder. But when more people turn up missing or dead, Anywhere's only detective, Detective Lloyd , realizes that this is much bigger than a simple murder case.
