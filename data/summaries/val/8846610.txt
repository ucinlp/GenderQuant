Loosely based on the Sidney Kingsley play of the same name: a dedicated young doctor places his patients above everyone else in his life. Unfortunately, his Social Register fiance√© can't accept the fact that he considers an appointment in the operating room more important than attending a cocktail party. He soon drifts into an affair with a pretty nurse who shares his passion for healing.
