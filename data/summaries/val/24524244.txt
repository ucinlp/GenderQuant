Here Comes Dr. Tran opens upon a small 5-year old boy eating an apple in what appears to be a hut in an Eastern tropical locale, possibly Vietnam. Suddenly, a voice, who is unseen, begins to deliver a bombastic movie trailer-style monologue praising the boy as the greatest action hero the world has ever knownâ€”an action hero whom the narrator calls "Dr. Tran." The small boy, initially confused, grows increasingly aggravated with the intruding voice and repeatedly expresses that he is neither a doctor nor an action hero and asks the voice to leave him. After this, the trailer becomes increasingly surreal and strange, revealing some odd proclivities belonging to the character of Dr. Tran, and disclosing that a massive library of previous films  already exists in the Dr. Tran series. Shortly after, the voice descends into deliberately thin biological humor, and eventually even the young boy's world begins to alter. Much of this deliberate agitation of the child is continued until the movie draws to a close with the production credits.
