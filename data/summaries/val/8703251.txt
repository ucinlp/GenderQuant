Luis Denard, a former concert musician, Charles Boyer, is a Nationalist, in the midst of the Spanish Civil War. He travels to England to secure supplies, where is threatened by suspicion and Fascist agents. He finds unexpected help when he meets young socialite Rose Cullen, Lauren Bacall, whose Father, Lord Benditch, Holmes Herbert, is one of the men Denard is trying to meet. Everything seems to go wrong, when he’s mugged, and laid out cold. Not knowing who to trust, he enlists the aid of the young maid Else, Wanda Hendrix. Then, he runs into Contreras, Peter Lorre, and Mrs. Melandy, Katina Paxinou, Oscar winner, in 1943's For Whom the Bell Tolls. It’s a convoluted race to the end.http://shop.tcm.com/confidential-agent-dvd/detail.php?p=356570
