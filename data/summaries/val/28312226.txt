The film starts with a young, blonde woman, very much resembling Allison MacKenzie - who has disappeared years ago - arriving in town, and startling Allison's mother Constance . She identifies herself as Megan MacKenzie , Allison's long lost daughter who believes that she was conceived during a night when Allison was raped, severely beaten and left for dead in a ditch. Megan is immediately taken in by Constance and Elliot Carson ([[Tim O'Connor , and she tells them that Allison has been in a Boston mental institution for twenty years now. She has not spoken a word since, until Megan gave her a visit recently, she said 'Peyton Place'. Megan becomes involved with Dana Harrington , the son of Betty Anderson  and late Rodney Harrington - who died in 1980. Much to Dana's dissatisfaction, Betty is now engaged to Dorian Blake ([[John Beck , and they together live in the mansion that once belonged to Rodney's grandfather Martin Peyton, with Peyton's loyal housekeeper Hannah Cord , with whom Betty does not get along. Dana's connection with Megan affects his relationship with Kelly Carson , who lives with Constance and Elliot and is less than happy with Megan's arrival. Some residents, including Norman ([[Christopher Connelly , Rita  and Ada ([[Evelyn Scott  suspect that Rodney was Megan's father. Norman and Rita's son Joey  overhears this, and soon everyone knows. Believing that they are half brother and sister, Megan and Dana immediately end their relationship. Kelly is overjoyed when she finds out, but Dana wants nothing to do with her anymore, and they get into a quarrel, which leads to a car accident. Dana is arrested for speeding, and Dorian, fed up with his behavior, forces him to work in the mill, where Dana is bullied by the co-workers because of his background. Kelly realizes that she has no future with Dana and reluctantly elopes with Joey. Meanwhile, Allison is relocated to the Peyton Hospital, where her parents try to have contact with her. One night, she is strangled to death by someone, and the next day she is found hanging. The police overrule her death as a suicide, but lawyer Steven Cord ([[James Douglas  believes that she could never hang herself and suspects that she was murdered. He travels to the farm where she was found in a ditch 21 years earlier, and the owner  tells her that around the same time, a Boston University student was working for her. He disappeared shortly after the raping, and was never questioned by the police. Steven believes that this man has raped Allison, and through Elliot's newspaper archive, he finds out that this man is Dorian. At the same time, Dorian harasses Megan. Scared, she calls to Dana for help, and afterwards goes outside, where Dorian runs over her with his car. Afterwards, Dorian returns home, where he finds out through the news that Megan is still alive, but in critical condition. He calls to the hospital for further details on Megan's condition, which confuses Betty, who tries to understand why her husband is so taken with the girl. When Dorian admits to having raped Allison, Betty tries to run away into the woods, but he catches her and almost pushes her off a cliff. However, Steven arrives around the same time at the cliff, and after a struggle, Dorian is pushed off and falls to his death. Steven takes Betty back home, where she reveals that he is Dana's biological father. She explains that she kept this a secret to assure that Dana would inherit Peyton's estate. Steven is initially upset with Betty, but he later forgives her, and then bonds with his son. Dana next goes to the hospital, where he tells Megan that they are not related, after which they kiss.
