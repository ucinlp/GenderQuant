Jeanne and Jean are being happily married in their rural village. Their idyll is promptly shattered when Jeanne, on her wedding night, is subjected to a ritual deflowering by the village headsman and his lackeys and subsequently rejected by Jean. Now disillusioned with the present order of society, she makes a deal with the Devil in return for the power to lead a rebellion. The narrative of Michelet's Sorceress and her resistance against feudalism and the Catholic Church is fudged into that of Joan of Arc , whom Belladonnas Jeanne is revealed to be, and her execution by burning.
