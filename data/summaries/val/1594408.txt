{{plot}} On a distant planet, a powerful wizard named Larigot is hunted by Divatox a pirate and evil queen who seeks his golden key to traverse a dimensional barrier to join forces in an evil matrimony with an evil demon named Maligore. Evading Divatox's Piranhatrons, Larigot transports himself to Earth to seek out his friend Alpha 5 and ask Zordon for help. He ends up landing in Africa and quickly becomes weakened by the planet's ultraviolet light. Seeking out regular animals for help to find Alpha he eventually finds a pack of chimps to take him with them. Meanwhile, while practicing for a martial arts tournament to fund the Angel Grove Youth Shelter with Adam and Tommy, Rocky becomes impatient and makes a bad move, causing him to fall out of the ring and injure his back. Justin, who is one of the children who attend the Youth Center is particularly upset by this and goes to visit Rocky in the hospital. He hides when Tommy, Adam, Kat and Tanya come to visit, and inadvertently witnesses Zordon summon them to the Power Chamber, revealing their identities to him by mistake. At the same time, Bulk and Skull become lost when making their way to an event and are suddenly accosted by Divatox's mutant nephew Elgar, but are rejected as she needs two spirits of purity and strength, which they lack. She then spots two perfect specimens diving off the coast near where the ship is and she captures them. Using tracking devices, Tommy and Kat teleport to Africa to find Larigot. Kat is nearly attacked by a python which Tommy wrestles to the ground, sending Kat over the edge of a large waterfall which injures her leg. They find Larigot who heals Kat's leg with a touch and they return to the Power Chamber. Shortly after, Divatox contacts Zordon and the Rangers using a telepathic transmission from Larigot's wife Yara and their baby Batel. She threatens them harm if Larigot doesn't turn himself over to her willingly, and as an added incentive, she offers her captured specimens; former Power Rangers Jason Lee Scott and Kimberly Hart. When they go to meet, Elgar tricks them and takes Larigot, leaving dummies in place of Kim and Jason. To give chase, the Rangers are given new Turbo powers and powerful car-like Zords. Justin joins them at the last minute as the new Blue Ranger and they board the Ghost Galleon, a ship undetectable by Divatox's scanners. However she detects their presence on the ship and sends Putripods after them. They manage to subdue the creatures and join their Power Keys to traverse the dimensional barrier. Meanwhile, Jason, Kim, Bulk and Skull open the bilge they are being held in and everyone but Jason escapes. Kim is caught by the Malichians, the guardians of Maligore shortly after and becomes Divatox's prisoner again. Meanwhile, the Rangers morph and track Divatox to Maligore's temple. Despite their efforts, Kim and Jason are sacrificed to Maligore and made evil forcing the Rangers to fight them as well as Divatox's minions. Larigot and Yara are reunited and use their powers to cure Jason and Kimberly who help turn the tide of battle. Maligore awakens fully and Divatox sicks him on them, the Rangers form the Turbo Megazord and defeat Maligore. Leaving Divatox to retreat, threatening her revenge on the Rangers for ruining her plans. Jason, Kim, Bulk and Skull are picked up by the Rangers, but the latter pair faint at the sight of Larigot and his family. Later, Jason joins Tommy and Adam in Rocky's place and they win the competition, securing the Youth Center's funding. Later, back at the Power Chamber, the Rangers bid Larigot and his family a fond farewell, the day having been saved once again.
