Angus Flint , a Scottish archaeology student excavating the site of a convent at the Derbyshire bed and breakfast run by the Trent sisters, Mary  and Eve , unearths an unusual skull which appears to be that of a large snake. He tries to find the local legend of the d'Ampton "worm", a mythical snake slain in Stonerich Cavern by John d'Ampton, the ancestor of current Lord of the Manor, James d'Ampton . When the watch of the Trent sisters' father, who disappeared a year ago near Temple House, the stately home of Lady Sylvia Marsh , is found miles away in Stonerich Cavern, James thinks the legendary creature may have survived and still be alive deep beneath the cavern. The enigmatic Lady Sylvia is the immortal priestess to the snake god Dionin, which, as James suspected, still exists in the caves beneath her house which connect with Stonerich Cavern. She steals the skull and later abducts Eve to be the latest sacrificial offering to her god, but her actions are discovered and James with the help of Angus manages to rescue Eve and destroy both Sylvia and the worm, but both are unfortunately contaminated, and so will be carrying on the snakelike vampiric condition.
