A young, rebellious Dutch woman  walks the trails of Ireland, vagabond by choice, enjoying the solitude she was looking for in the austere landscape of Connemara. He  is a young senior man, living a solitary life in a secluded house on a beautiful island. She is radical and uncompromising. He is wise and ironic. What connects them is solitude they both see as freedom. He proposes her to work for him in exchange for food. She agrees at one condition: there will be no personal contact between them, just work. Soon the two of them become curious about each other and want both: to keep their “nothing personal” deal and to break it. Their simple life follows the cycle of days and nights, work and rest but slowly brings the two of them closer to each other. It's only a matter of time before one of them breaks the deal.{{cite web}}
