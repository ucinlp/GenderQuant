For generations the Sooryavansh family has ruled the village communities and its people justly and fairly. Current generation is headed by Thakur Bhanupratap Singh  who is feared and respected in the village. He has 3 sons; the youngest named Heera  is treated like a servant because he is the most illiterate of the family, and he will not have anything to do with him. Heera is an obedient son and always respectful of his father despite his father's indifference. His father is enraged when Heera proposes to marry his childhood sweetheart, Gauri ; and even more angered when Heera backs down promising never to marry again. Unknown to Thakur, Gauri refuses to marry an illiterate and makes Heera promise that he will not marry her. At this time, Radha  enters his life; understanding his gentle and kind manner, she loves and proposes to marry him. She encourages Heera to live independently; and to help set up his own business. By now, Heera is completely disowned by his father Thakur for breaking his promise of lifelong bachelorhood. Heera and Radha leave the village to live in their own home and Heera becomes a successful businessman, and Radha an important government officer. Soon, they are blessed with a son. Heera successfully fulfills what was once his father's dream, a charitable hospital for the poor. Thakur comes to know of his grandchild, and meets him secretly without anyone knowing. One day, he is rushed to hospital, apparently poisoned by food sent to him by Heera, and Heera becomes the prime suspect of the attempted murder.
