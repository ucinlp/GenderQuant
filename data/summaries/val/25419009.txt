Aryan Pandit lives a middle-class lifestyle with his family in Nasik, India, where the entire family depend on his salesman father's earnings. He relocates to Bombay's St. Andrews College with big dreams of being wealthy and driving a red Ferrari. He befriends three other middle-class youth: Papad, Mushy, and Chicken. He borrows money from Matka Rajan, gambles it, loses everything, and is unable to re-pay. As a result Rajan sets his goons on him. Aryan goes to a man named Baba for help, who in turn takes him to Mamta Shekari. Shekari offers to hire him as a hit man, agreeing to pay him 20,000 rupees for every killing, so that he can re-pay his gambling loan. Aryan reluctantly accepts, is trained by Baba to shoot a gun, and kills his first target, none other than Rajan himself. He tells his friends about his good fortune, and they join forces with him. In all killing contracts they are provided with a photograph, the location, and are instructed to look at the photo just 15 minutes before killing the person. In this manner the friends enjoy their new-found wealth. When Aryan's Parsi girlfriend, Dilnawaaz finds out, she wants him to quit. He does, but his friends refuse to let go of this easy money and luxurious life. Shortly thereafter, the trio are given a contract; before the killing they look at the photograph ... of Aryan. The trio knows that it is too late to back out of this 'supari' .
