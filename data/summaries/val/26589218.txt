A sophomore majoring in engineering, Yusef  seeks living quarters with fellow Muslims after a year in the godless dorms. He moves—rather improbably, given his conservative nature—into a building inhabited by various punky misfits  wrestling with their cultural and religious identity. Or, as red-mohawked guitarist Jehangir  puts it, their "mismatching of disenfranchised subcultures." Others include ever-shirtless skateboarding wild man Amazing Ayyub , spike-haired stoner Fasiq  and brawny, glowering Umar , the would-be moral enforcer in a houseful of rebels against Koranic strictures. Sole female in residence is Rabeya , who wears a head-to-toe burka yet is full of ideas that might be considered blasphemous.
