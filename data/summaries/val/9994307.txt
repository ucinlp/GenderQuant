The chief of the French secret service, Louis Toulouse, in a plot to discredit his second in command, Bernard Milan , sends his assistant, Perrache, to choose at random someone from the crowd of travelers arriving at the Orly airport, having made Milan believe that Perrache has gone to meet a master spy who will expose Milan's treachery. Perrache happens to select François Perrin, an unsuspecting violinist, who is noticeable because as the result of a practical joke he has arrived wearing a black shoe on one foot and a reddish-brown one on the other. Milan takes the bait and immediately begins a series of attempts to find out what Perrin knows—blind to the fact that Perrin knows nothing at all about espionage, although he is an expert on music. Milan's machinations involve Perrin in a series of increasingly peculiar adventures, and although he is largely oblivious to the mayhem Milan causes to occur around him, he can't help noticing the beautiful femme fatale, Christine. In a startling scene, she greets him at her door in a demure high-necked black-velvet dress, then turns around and shows that the dress is backless, displaying discreet buttock cleavage.  A slapstick love scene ensues, followed by more mayhem and treachery, leading to the death of several secret-service thugs and the downfall of Milan. Toulouse watches the chaos serenely. The film ends, as it had begun, at Orly. Perrin is pushing a huge Louis Vuitton steamer trunk in an airport luggage cart, talking softly to it.  Their destination is Rio.
