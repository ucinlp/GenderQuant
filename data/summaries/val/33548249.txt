You Only Loved Me Twice is a silent film that shows the way deception can be deadly. Wife Amy Miller  is preparing a romantic meal for her husband with flowers and wine. Amy has a perturbed look on her face, which the audience realizes is because she has recently stumbled upon photos of her husband Ray Miller  with a young sassy blonde Lisa Hewitt . When Ray comes home, he brings flowers perhaps to make up for a fight the couple recently had. The couple begins to eat in silence until Ray drops his glass of wine. Amy is in the middle of aiming a gun she has taped under the table. Ray and Amy are cleaning the wine when he sees the gun. The couple begins a choreographed tango. Ray reaches for the gun and he shoots Amy, while his next move is to wait for Lisa to join him.<ref namehttp://www.imdb.com/video/wab/vi3936329241/|titleImdb.com |date2011-10-27}}
