Harold "Harry" Brown, an elderly former Royal Marine currently living in a council estate ruled by violent gangs, spends most of his time playing chess with his best friend, Leonard "Len" Attwell and visiting his hospitalised and comatose wife, Katherine, who suddenly dies from complications. Harry is late to see her before she dies because he is too scared to take the quicker underpass route, where a gang resides. After her funeral, Len confides in Harry that he is being terrorised by some youths and shows Harry an old bayonet he now carries to defend himself, citing that the police would not help him and he plans on taking justice into his own hands. The next day, Harry is visited by Detective Inspector Alice Frampton and Detective Sergeant Terence "Terry" Hicock, who tell him that Len had been murdered by a local gang led by Noel Winters. After Len's funeral, Harry is held at knife-point by Dean Saunders, an addict and suspect in Len's murder, whom he stabs in self defence during a brief struggle. Frampton visits Harry again the following morning and informs him that because Len was killed with his own bayonet, any charges laid could be reduced to manslaughter on the basis of self-defence. Harry decides to take matters into his own hands; he follows a drug dealer named Kenny to a squalid den where he negotiates to buy a pistol. Inside, Harry finds Kenny and his associate, Stretch are also growing cannabis and are sexually abusing a currently overdosing girl to make pornography. When Harry suggests calling an ambulance for the girl, Stretch threatens Harry, and he kills the dealers in retaliation, before burning down their den and leaving with the girl and some firearms. After leaving the girl outside a hospital, Harry captures one of Noel's gang members named Marky, who is being sexually abused by Troy Martindale, a heroin kingpin. Harry shoots and kills Martindale and captures Marky, whom he tortures into revealing some mobile phone camera footage of Len's murder, proving the gang's aggressive involvement. Harry uses Marky to bait Noel and Carl, another gang member, into a gunfight in the underpass. Carl is killed by Harry, and Marky is killed in the crossfire between Harry and Noel. After Marky is killed, Noel flees the underpass, with Harry in pursuit, before Harry collapses due to an emphysema attack. Convinced that the recent gang deaths are related to a gang war rather than Harry, Police Superintendent Childs orders a major arrest operation on the estate, which then leads to a massive riot. Harry discharges himself from hospital to pursue Noel, which results in Frampton and Hicock being in a car crash when they attempt to stop him. Harry rescues them and takes them to a nearby pub, where Frampton warns Harry that Sidney "Sid" Rourke, the bartender, is actually Noel's uncle. Harry discovers that Sid had been hiding Noel, but his guard drops due to his emphysema, allowing Sid to take the gun and reveal that he plans on killing Harry and the officers to protect Noel. Frampton tries to call for backup, only to be stopped midway by Noel, who is told to strangle her after Sid suffocates an unconscious Hicock. After Harry draws a revolver and shoots Noel, Sid shoots and wounds Harry, only to be shot by Frampton's backup in the form of police snipers, which had picked up on her interrupted call. At a conference held after the riot, Superintendent Childs announces that Frampton and the late Hicock will be given medals for their work and sacrifice, and denies any evidence of vigilante involvement in the entire case, saying that any such suggestions are unhelpful. The final scene is of a recovered Harry walking towards the underpass, now free and safe to walk through.
