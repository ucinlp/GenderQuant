In the spring of 2003, the filmmakers Jason Russell, Bobby Bailey, and Laren Poole traveled to Africa to document the War in Darfur. Instead, they changed their focus to the conflict in northern Uganda, Africa's second longest-running conflict after the Eritrean War of Independence. The documentary depicts the abduction of children who are used as child soldiers by Joseph Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army . This film centers around a group of Ugandan children who walk miles every night to places of refuge in order to avoid abduction by the LRA.
