Set in an ordinary Canadian town, it follows Parker Jones , a formerly troubled youth, on a morning when he is running late for school. Arriving, he seeks out his girlfriend, Macy, but she is also a no-show that day. When he asks if his friends Steven  and Josie  have seen her, both disavow any knowledge of such a person. Her locker is no longer hers, and when he calls her house, he is told that she does not live there. Confused and distraught, Parker must now grapple with himself to answer the burning question: "Was she real?". Believing that he had lost his mind and his life is not worth living, Parker takes his own life by jumping off a secluded bridge into a river. The final narration reveals that it was an April Fool's joke that had gone terribly wrong.
