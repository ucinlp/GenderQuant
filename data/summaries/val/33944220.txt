During a set of winter holidays, all the dragons of Berk unexpectedly depart, with the exception of Toothless; the latter remaining by reason of his inability to fly unaided. Out of compassion, Hiccup creates him a new prosthesis allowing him independent flight, and thus allows his escape. Three days later, Fishlegs' Gronckle 'Meatlug', the last remaining dragon, escapes the prison in which Fishlegs kept her and mistakenly seizes Hiccup. Meatlug travels to a sulfur-hot springs island where the other dragons have been laying eggs and having babies. Dragon eggs are also discovered by Astrid and the gang in Meatlug's nest, which they scatter around Berk in hopes of lifting the villagers' spirits. While looking for Toothless, Hiccup meets Stormfly , Hookfang  and their babies, who explosively hatch from their eggs . Wanting to get a ride home, Hiccup inadvertently triggers their return migration. Eventually, the citizens are stunned to see the dragons approaching with Hiccup, who has harnessed them to an abandoned boat hull to carry their flightless infants. Relieved that the dragons have returned, Stoick, Hiccup's father, prepares a celebration. During the celebration, Astrid thanks Hiccup for returning the dragons and kisses him. Moments later, Toothless comes back, and it is revealed he has spent his entire time away looking for Hiccup's helmet, which he now brings in his mouth. The next day, Toothless destroys his new tail and compels Hiccup to put the old saddle on him and be his rider again. Hiccup closes the short saying that he had given Toothless a gift , but Toothless gave him a better one .
