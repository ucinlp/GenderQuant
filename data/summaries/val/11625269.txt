Babu and Malik are two inseparable friends who live in a small town in India. One day they decide to play a prank and steal something. They get caught, while Malik's dad come to bail out and stand surety for him, Babu has no one to do so and ends up in the juvenile centre. When the two grow up, Malik becomes a Police Inspector, while Babu takes to crime and ends up being sentenced in jail. When he gets discharged, he goes to meet with his partner-in-crime, Bali, and together they start planning the next heist. Malik meets with Babu and tells him to go straight, but Babu had already tried that and ended up being falsely accused of stealing a necklace belonging to his employer's wife. Nevertheless, Babu does inform Bali that he will not be taking part in any crime. Thereafter, Bali and his men are arrested, and blame Babu for ratting on them. Bali is released on bail, Babu meets with him, an argument ensues, leading to a physical fight, with Bali getting killed. A fearful Babu flees Bombay and lands up in Jogendranagar in Northern India, where he meets with a man named Bhagat who asks him to masquerade as Kundan, the sole heir of a wealthy man named Shahji. When Babu refuses, Bhagat threatens to notify the Police. Babu becomes Kundan, makes his way into the hearts of Shahji, his wife, Rukmani, and daughter, Maya. Babu gets enough cash to pay off Bhagat in small instalments, but Bhagat becomes more and more demanding and wants Babu to steal all the cash and jewellery and abscond. Babu is reluctant to steal from these kind people, and to make matters worse has fallen in love with Maya - his 'sister'. Caught between a rock and a hard place - no matter what move Babu makes - he will surely end up trapping himself - not only with Bhagat, his newfound family, as well as the police - who are now hot on his trail.
