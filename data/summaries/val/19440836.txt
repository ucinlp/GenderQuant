Nick Gunar, ex-soldier is down and out in Chicago in a typically cold winter. When two men offer him a job on a tropical island, he reluctantly agrees and gathers together a group of soldier friends also down on their luck. They arrive in the Far East and come up against the evil Keefer who was with them in Angola. He now owns the local police force and shows Nick and the others who's boss. Afterwards, Nick and his crew go to the island which they find is occupied by peaceful natives. Nick respects them but there is some friction by a few of them who want to kill some natives to reveal where the treasure is. Nick stops them, and finds out the treasure they are after is guano . The two men intend to strip the island to get it, leaving the natives as casualties. The group divides up and Nick hands half of them their marching orders  as he refuses to kill the natives to do the job. Meanwhile, Keefer has scented money and dealt himself in. He joins the group Nick kicked out along with the Colonel and battle begins. Many are shot, stabbed, blown up and worse as mercenaries and natives die. Though poorly armed, the natives make up for this in trickery and local knowledge. Nick has a bazooka style weapon  which causes mayhem. After a number of attacks by both sides, many are dead and finally, there is the final showdown between Nick and Keefer, with the latter gaining the upper hand in the fist fight and attempting to strangle Nick to death while drowning him. Nick manages to grab a nearby bone and stab Keefer in the neck, then proceeds to drown him. As the natives bury their dead, the few surviving mercenaries leave but Nick stays behind.
