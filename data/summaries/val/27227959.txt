Stranded in New York City due to missing a bus caused by a delay of a plane, recently divorced mother Susannah Bartok  is attacked and maced outside Macy's in Manhattan, and her 2-year-old son gets kidnapped. After she unsuccessfully pleads to the police, who feel indifferent about the case, newspaper reporter Victoria Garcia  helps the young mother in finding her son. Susannah, desperate to find her son, initially rejects Victoria's help because she is realistic about the possible fate of her boy, though convinced that the police are not doing their job quickly enough, she allows Victoria's help. Victoria redirects Susannah to a psychic called Christopher Zellner , who believes that her son Sonny is dead. Susannah refuses to believe him, and continues her intense and exhausting search. After putting a photo of her son in the newspaper, several 'witnesses' report to the police, but they are all frauds, annoying Lt. Ernest Foy . During their search, they discover an underground black market ring, selling young children.
