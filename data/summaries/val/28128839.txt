It’s Halloween and Daffy Duck’s nephew  goes Trick-or-treating as a witch, in the same outfit that Bugs Bunny wore in Broom-Stick Bunny. He soon visits Witch Hazel’s house. He runs home screaming like a girl after being scared by Witch Hazel’s hideous face . At home, Daffy's nephew tries to explain to his uncle that he saw a witch. Daffy gets angry at his nephew and explains him that "there is no such thing a a witch, and that she’s just a poor old lady trying to get along". He tells him that he’ll prove it by meeting Witch Hazel. Back at Witch Hazel’s home Hazel complains that "all she does is work in front of a hot stove making potions" and that she needs a vacation. But, she must choose someone to take her place. Speedy Gonzales comes and asks for a cup of cheese. Hazel just complains but soon gets an idea. She grabs a special piece of cheese and feeds it to Speedy. Speedy turns into an identical copy of Witch Hazel and the real Witch Hazel asks him if he can act like her. Speedy, who is quite calm about this, says okay and runs around the house yelling his usual “Ándale, ándale, arriba, arriba, arriba, epa, epa.” Witch Hazel says he still acts like himself but it will do. She takes off to Hawaii, leaving Speedy to take care of the shop. Then Daffy comes over and Speedy welcomes him in. Speedy makes tea out of Witch Hazel’s potions, leaving Daffy alone. Daffy, little frightened, stays in the house stating that "she can be somebody’s mother, or father, or something". Witch Speedy gives Daffy tea, turning him into the flower creature from Duck Amuck. Hazel then comes back from Hawaii and, after seeing what Speedy has done, turns him into a mouse again. She then sees Daffy and gets in a mood for a duck dinner. She then turns Daffy into his old body. Daffy immediately runs away from Hazel. She catches him on a broom. Daffy jumps off her broom and parachutes down but the parachute turns into an anvil. Witch Hazel laughs until she runs into a rock. Down on the ground Daffy gets scared of another witch, who turned out to be his nephew in his witch disguise. His nephew asks him if he saw the witch but Daffy just tells him that "she's just some creepy old lady trying to scare people, and that witchcraft is just a myth, an old superstiton". On the way home Daffy turns back into the flower creature again, unbeknownst to his nephew. .Misce-Looney-Ous: The Reused Animation Guide
