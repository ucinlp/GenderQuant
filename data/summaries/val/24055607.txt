A clumsy but well-meaning young man named Greg  is on his way to visit his girlfriend Pam's  parents for the first time. Stopping at a gas station on the way, he is warned by an attendant  of his girlfriend's previous boyfriend's catastrophic experience when he first met her overprotective father. He ignores the advice to turn around and go home. Arriving at the parents' home, he quickly becomes a target of the girl's family's anger when he, among other things, clogs and overflows the toilet, destroys the dinner roast and the family's beloved Victrola, almost blinds his girlfriend's mother with a fishing rod, gets into bed with his girlfriend's sister, and accidentally drowns the family dog. When he feels that the family has nearly been brought to the brink of destruction, his girlfriend's father chases him out of the house with a shotgun.
