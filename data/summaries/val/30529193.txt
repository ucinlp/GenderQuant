 Private Snafu is seen performing the tedious task of sorting boots. Driven to madness by boredom he is taken to visit his brothers Tarfu and Fubar by the gruff Technical Fairy, First Class, somewhat in the spirit of Ebenezer Scrooge and the Ghosts of Christmas. Brother Tarfu is seen tending to the every need of carrier pigeons while brother Fubar is the unlucky dummy used in training attack dogs. After seeing his brothers' terrible jobs Private Snafu returns to work with gusto, exclaiming that his job is important.
