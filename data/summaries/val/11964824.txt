During a walk to the park Raghuraman  meets Sudhakar  and tells him about daughter Abhi . Raghuraman is the loving husband of Anu  and the worrisome as well as caring father of his only daughter Abhi. Together they live a calm and content life in Ooty. Also living with them is "Ravi Shastri"  who was earlier a beggar and was adopted by Abhi. Raghuraman and Abhi become best friends. Over the years as Abhi grows up, Raghuraman has the joy of being a part of her life. When Abhi gets accepted in a prestigious college in New Delhi, Raghuraman is shocked. Although the thought of being separated from his daughter for two whole years is heartbreaking, Raghuraman wearily accepts. After returning from college, Abhi tells her parents that she has fallen in love with a young man in Delhi. Anu is perfectly all right with the idea, but Raghuraman is angry and scared. He shouts at Abi and does not talk to her properly. Anu later informs Raghuraman that their future son-in-law will be arriving by flight and staying with them for a while. As soon as Raghuraman meets his future son-in-law, Joginder Singh , he is taken aback because Joginder is a Sikh. After many conflicts with Abhi and Anu, Raghuraman finally realizes that Joginder is self-sacrificing and quite talented, more so when on one occasion the Prime Minister calls him for advice. Abhi and Joginder get married and leave for Delhi. Anu and Abhi get teary-eyed, but Raghuraman stays calm. This is very surprising, because he was the one that had cried on his daughter's first day to school. Raghuraman tells Sudhakar that he still stays in touch with his daughter and often gets to see her. Sudhakar understands how Raghuraman feels, because he has a baby daughter himself. The movie ends with a phone call from Abhi.
