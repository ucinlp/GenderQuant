Berit, a young woman living in a working-class port town begins a relationship with Gösta, a sailor newly returned from overseas and intent upon staying on land. The plot and character development centre on the relationship between Berit and Gösta, as she discloses her troubled past of family problems, reformories and various affairs to him and he must deal with his own feelings and conflicts about such disclosure. While "Port of Call" has never been considered an early masterpiece of Bergman's, it is of note in presenting in nascent form some of the themes of alienation, the difficulty of relationships and the difficulty of dealing with the past that would become central to Bergman's later films. It is also to be noted that this 1948 Swedish film deals with adolescent sexuality, promiscuity and abortion in a frank and open way that would have been impossible to portray in Hollywood films of the same period. Indeed, there is at one brief point in the film a nude scene that would have had the film banned in the USA at the time.
