During a party at the United States offices of a Japanese corporation, a professional escort  is found dead, apparently after a violent sexual encounter. Police Detective Web Smith  and John Connor , a former police Captain and expert on Japanese affairs, are sent to investigate. During the initial investigation, Smith believes the evidence indicates a sexual encounter and murder; however, Connor insists there is a deeper involvement by the corporation. After a grueling investigation, Connor receives a disc which contains the surveillance footage from the night of the murder. This later turns out to be a digitally altered video of the actual murder. The alteration implicates Eddie Sakamura , who is the son of a wealthy Japanese businessman . After recovering the original unaltered footage, the video shows the prostitute was only unconscious following rough sex with a powerful politician at the party, and a company employee strangled her after the politician left. The head of the company was unaware of the crime and subsequent cover-up, and exiled the perpetrator of the cover-up to a desk job in Japan. The murderer himself runs away when he is identified, but is soon taken care of by Eddie's Yakuza friends, who bury him alive in wet concrete.
