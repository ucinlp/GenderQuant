The space shuttle Olympus is on a routine mission, but with a far-from-routine payload: "Project Viper," an experimental hybrid of human genes and computer chips, designed to adapt to any environment, particularly that of the planet Mars. But as the shuttle crew prepares to launch the prototype into space, something unexpected occurs. Soon the astronauts are dead, and the Secretary of Defense orders the remaining prototype destroyed. To do the job, he calls on special agent Mike Connors . Unaware of these proceedings, Project Viper head Nancy Burnham  and her team at NovaGen — Steve Elkins , Sid Bream  and Alan Stanton  — are celebrating the fruition of their scientific dream. One more member, Cafferty , is on her way — but never makes it. Soon the second prototype is stolen from the high-security lab by those who waylaid her, but escapes into a lake near the town of Lago Nogales and begins feeding on the unwary populace. Connors, Burnham and crew arrive to find a suspicious sheriff , mysterious disappearances, gooey remains, unpredictable genetic side-effects, treason and murder, as the clock ticks down toward a nuclear strike the military has prepared to stop the rapidly and continually growing Viper. Connors eventually destroys Viper with an EMP bomb, but the other one on the space shuttle crashes into the ocean.
