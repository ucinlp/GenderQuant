In the past the Angels lived free on Earth's surface. They hunted humans to feed on their vital energy, called Prana. This was true until mankind decided to rise against them with the aid of Apollonius; a powerful Angel who sided with humanity against his peers. Apollonius had fallen in love with a woman called Celiane. Together Apollonius, Celiane, and a human noble called Scorpius battled the Angels riding a giant humanoid machine; the Mechanical Angel Aquarion. Their valiant efforts lead to the Angels' defeat and their subsequent confinement in their icy prison. However Scorpius had a desire to become an angel himself and it caused him to betray and kill his comrade Apollonius. 12,000 years have passed and the Angels have reappeared to threaten mankind once more, kidnapping humans from entire cities around the globe in order to use their Prana to bring their people back to life. Deava, an international organization created to fight the Angels using replicas of the original Aquarion had little success so far. But when the reincarnations of Apollonius, Celiane and Scorpius finally meet together, the real Aquarion reappears on Earth, and the wheels of fate start to turn once more.
