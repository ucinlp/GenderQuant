The customers in a nightclub clamor for Goopy Geer, who then comes out on the stage and entertains them by playing the piano, first with his fingers and his ears, later with his animated gloves. He's soon accompanied by a girl who tells a joke and sings a song. Meanwhile, the customers eat and carry on in slapstick ways, and two coat racks dance together. Toward the end, a drunken horse breathes fire and destroys the piano, but Goopy keeps right on playing.
