Two common working-class people, Robert and Jenny, meet one day in a bar. After Robert defends Jenny against her date, a district attorney's chauffeur, who is trying to get her drunk, they begin a relationship. She soon discovers that she will be tried in court for an abortion she needed a few years previously. Her parents disown her and she loses her job as a saleswoman. Robert stays with her, admitting his own responsibility for killing someone when he was 17 years old. Distraught at the thought of going to prison, Jenny convinces Robert to commit suicide with her. Just as she is planning the suicide, her lawyer comes and announces that the case has been droppedâ€”the case had been delayed too long while the district attorney was in the hospital after his chauffeur has caused an automobile accident.
