When Nikki South  inherits the contents of a bank strongbox left by her father, former gangland boss Jack South, she realises that the contents form a clue to the number of a Swiss bank account used to stash her father's ill-gotten gains - an idea possibly derived form the money supposedly left in a secret account by Diana Dors. Nikki is waylaid on her way to her birthday party and as the masked attackers try to wrest the clues, kept in an envelope, from her, and is rescued by Terry , who is working as a temporary doorman at the club where the party is to be held. She later thanks him by presenting him with two return tickets for the Orient Express to Venice. Terry, not realising Nikki has an ulterior motive for inviting him, plans to take Annie, his current girlfriend who also works at the club, with him. Nikki plans to travel to Switzerland with her boyfriend Mark  on the same train to claim the contents. But others have their eyes on the potential windfall, especially several former associates of her father. They include a bent bank manager , a hitman  and the widow of a former associate . Arthur ([[George Cole  is on the run. He's been a reluctant witness to a protection racket attack and Detective Sergeant Rycott ([[Peter Childs  is trying to serve a subpoena on him to testify in court against violent local gangster, Brian "Brain Damage" Gammidge. Arthur persuades Terry's girlfriend that Terry's  wife and children have arrived unexpectedly, and when she angrily dumps him, Arthur turns up at the railway station and brazenly persuades a furious Terry to take him along, thus evading the subpoena. As they travel towards Folkestone, Nikki enlists Terry's help again, as the former associates try to get the envelope off her. They also discover that Arthur's other nemesis, Detective Sergeant Chisholm , is also travelling on the train, having been seconded to Interpol alongside Interpol agent Sergeant Francois LeBlanc  to observe the various 'faces'. As the train travels through night-time France, matters eventually come to a head and a free-for-all scrap ensues. Even Chisholm joins in the fight, upholding the honour of the police in the face of an easy-going and slightly drunk French detective. As the train comes to a halt following the pulling of the emergency cord, Arthur, Terry and Nikki get off the train, to be joined by Chisholm. Nikki and Terry complete the cracking of the code to the bank account number , but following a fight with two of the villains on a local French train, the partial Swiss Bank account number is lost. So there's no pot of gold for anyone and the protagonists return to Fulham Broadway.
