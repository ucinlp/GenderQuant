The film begins six years after Kuryu Kohei was transferred to Ishigaki Island . We learn in the interim that he has since been transferred to Sapporo and then to a brief tenure in Yamaguchi Prefecture . Kuryu Kohei returns to the same Tokyo Branch DA's Office from the TV series and reunites with his old workmates. The events of the film takes him to Korea, wraps up plot threads from the TV special and allows Amamiya and Kuryu to rekindle their relationship which had been in limbo since their date at the 2002 World Cup . Kuryu prosecutes a fatal hit and run case, but runs into obstruction and interference as the chief suspect is a witness to a high profile Federal political case. As such, Kuryu must face an elite, powerful lawyer, played by Koshiro Matsumoto. Proving his suspect guilty risks collapsing the federal case. However, as always, Kuryu only cares about finding the truth and justice about his case and goes to great lengths  to find it. While the TV episodes focused mostly on Kuryu's pre-trial investigative abilities, the film showcases Kuryu's legal skills within the courtroom, leaving Amamiya and the other co-workers to do much of the legwork.
