When American heiress Pearl Saunders learns her groom, Lord George Grayston, has married her for her money, she is devastated by the news but chooses to remain wed. Pearl socializes with a group of wealthy expatriate friends, including divorced duchess Minnie, gossip-loving Thornton Clay, philanthropic princess Flora, and Arthur Fenwick, her older lover and benefactor. Pearl introduces her younger sister Bessie to English aristocracy and urges her to pursue a relationship with Lord Harry Bleane. Although she is the target of Fleming Harvey's affections, Bessie is seduced by the glamour of high society and joins her sister for a weekend at the Grayston country estate. When Minnie discovers her gigolo Pepi D'Costa is romancing Pearl, she publicly exposes their indiscretion. Mortified at having her innocent sister learn about her unseemly behavior, Pearl retreats to her room, while Minnie prepares to return to London. Fearful her reputation will be tarnished by Minnie's gossip, Pearl plots to delay her departure and tries to ingratiate herself with the rest of her guests. When Bessie accuses her of hypocrisy, Pearl has second thoughts and steers her sister away from Harry and back to the doting Fleming. She then convinces Minnie to stay another night and learn the latest tango steps from effete dance instructor Ernest.
