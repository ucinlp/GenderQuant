Annalisse's mother rents the home of an old high school classmate Clay Roff , whose troubled teenage daughter Mary  disappeared sometime earlier. Clay invites the two to dinner at his house to meet his current wife, Dr. Danielle Roff , and his young daughter Heather. Soon after moving in, Annalisse starts having nightmares about a woman falling over a cliff, and is being haunted by the spirit of Mary. Annalisse begins to suspect foul play in Mary's disappearance and the death of Mary's mother Ann, who she was having the nightmares about. Annalisse is soon suspected of mental illness by her mother, Clay, and Danielle. Annalisse becomes interested in a local man, Johnny Toussard , which upsets Mary's spirit. Clay warns her not to get involved with the dangerous man. Despite these warnings, the two see each other, setting off Mary's wrath. Danielle convinces Annalisse's mother to have her temporarily committed for observation. While Clay watches from outside, Danielle states that Annalisse maybe suffering the same mental illness Mary had. When released, Annalisse decides to investigate into Danielle's past. Annalisse discovers that Danielle was treating and drugging Mary, and she suspects she murdered Ann. Mary possesses Annalisse to visit Johnny, confronts her father, and her spirit rides her beloved horse that tramples Danielle, killing her. Clay discovered that Danielle had murdered Ann, drugged Mary into a psychotic state and she's been drugging Annalise to keep her silent. Danielle had been having an affair with the then married Clay. She was pregnant and had been plotting to marry him. Clay had blocked out burying Mary's body by the cliff after he believed she had murdered her mother, then committed suicide. Mary's spirit is now at rest. She thanks Annalisse, saying, "You'll always be my sister." Mary tells her she'll wait for her on the other side and vanishes. Annalisse reunites with Johnny and is free.
