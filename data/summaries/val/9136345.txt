Junpei, a low-level yakuza, steals 500 million yen from his boss. While he's being interrogated, a stroke of good luck saves his life and lands him in prison for five years. Upon release, he hires invincible professional bodyguard Kiba to escort him to the hidden loot, so he can find his girlfriend and escape forever. Every step of the way the two are ambushed by angry yakuza, and even angrier students from a rival dojo that are mortified by Kiba's alleged comments that his Karate is more effective than theirs.
