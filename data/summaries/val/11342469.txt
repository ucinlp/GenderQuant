{{Plot}} Tom accompanies his owner, Clint Clobber, who has severe anger management issues, on a fishing trip. Seeing this as the perfect opportunity to humiliate Tom, Jerry gathers some fishing supplies and tags along. While Clobber is loading the car with supplies, Tom is resting in the back of the car, when suddenly, Jerry throws a spare fishing pole at his head. He then grabs a fence out of the garden and uses it to climb into the car, but is met by Tom, who responds by catapulting him out of the vehicle using its back door. The car then starts up, but Jerry manages to regain cover and boards the vehicle before it leaves. Meanwhile, Tom is keeping watch outside of the back door, and Jerry sneaks behind him and kicks him out of the car. Tom scratches his head on the pavement, but manages to make it back to the vehicle. He sees Jerry, and tries to grab him, before finally resorting to smacking him with a pan. However, he accidentally hits Clobber, who responds by smacking him with the pan several times. This causes him to get into trouble with traffic, provoking insults and road rage, allowing Tom and Jerry's fight to resume. Jerry runs under the front seat, prompting Tom to search for him with his hand. During this time, he jumps onto the gas pedal, causing the car to rapidly increase its speed. Clobber then notices his hand searching under the seat, and, believing it to be the cause, steps on it, causing his hand to swell and turn red. Jerry then beings tempting Tom with a first aid kit, who tries to smack him but misses, causing his hand to hurt further. He then chases Jerry outside, all the way to the front hood of the car. Tom's owner notices him, and responds by slowing the car down, causing him to fall off the car and scrape his fanny on the pavement. Tom then runs off to a nearby pond to cool off, evaporating all the water in the process. He then returns to the road and searches for Clobber, who appears and grabs him by the neck. As punishment, Tom is placed in the front seat for the remainder of the trip, though Tom manages to squeeze himself back into the back of the car. Before arriving, Jerry disguises one of Clobber's shoes as a mouse by drawing a face on it and placing brown flaps on its top. Once Tom and Clobber arrive at the lake, they are ready to fish. Tom out of through the back and to the front of the car. He then keeps guard as Clobber leaves the car. During this time, Tom notices Clobber's shoe, and, believing it to be Jerry, smacks it with an oar. This causes Clobber to bump his head against the car, who tries to pull himself out, prompting Tom to flee. However, Clobber manages to make it out of the roof and catches Tom with a fishing line, attacking him in a long off-screen thrashing. As punishment, Clobber makes him carry all the gear to the boat. On the boat, Tom sees Jerry in the basket and uses a pump to get him out. Angry, Jerry swims back to the boat. Tom and Clobber are fishing in peace. Jerry attaches a fishing line on Clobber while he and Tom were fishing. This causes Tom to get into a lot of trouble. After a heavy off-screen thrashing, Jerry and Clobber are now fishing together, throwing their catches into Tom's face who is tied up in the catch basket. Tears start to come out of Tom's eyes as the cartoon ends.
