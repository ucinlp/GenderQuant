“Haathon Ki Lakeeron,” the first of the four versions of the title song, opens up the drama. Raj Dixit  is a respectable average man who lives with his younger brother Rahul . The obstacle in Rahul’s life is not his physical handicap, cerebral palsy, but his imperative need for Raj. His dependency is like a flower without sunlight, without it he would simply whither away. When the normal youngster’s activities are for Rahul impossible without Raj, we come to see that their bond is improbably one of the closest. Raj seems quite solemn with a humane personalty. Khanna  takes advantage of Raj's quiescent personality and asks him to marry his niece, Madhuri . It doesn’t take long before Raj accepts the offer and develops a relationship with Madhuri. However, during “Pehli Nazar” and “Tadapati Hai, Tarsati Hai,” two romantic well-pictured numbers, a dilemma is evident. Raj explains to Madhuri that their relationship has little room for growth, as lovers anyways. After all if the sun started shining other places what would happen to the plants? Raj tries to present this to a reluctant Madhuri who later offers to send Rahul off to a school where his needs and dependency could be well suited. He decides, after some though, to try it out. We see who is the dependent one here and who has the handicap. There’s more to the story: that angle is Suman . Suman and her parents are Raj's neighbors, somewhat of surrogate parents to him at times. Suman is the fourth angle of the quadrangle.
