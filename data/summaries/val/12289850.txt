Hua Mulan, the heroine, is a young maiden who lives with her elderly father during the Northern Wei dynasty. When China is invaded by nomads, her father is called into service by the Emperor. In a scene of filial piety, Mulan dons her father's old armor and takes his place in the army. During training, the "feminine" Mulan is teased and harassed by other draftees who she promptly beats one by one to the ground. Admonishing them to unite together instead of harassing one another, she reminds them that the true enemy are the nomads invading their country. Also during training, she meets with Liu Fendou who becomes her loyal friend. The two feel a natural attraction, even if Liu is unsure why . These scenes therefore provide some comic relief and romantic intrigue. Eventually Mulan is set to the frontline where she meets with the army's weak commanders who flirt with the idea of cooperating with the nomads rather than fighting with them. In particular, the advisor to the general pushes for collaboration. Mulan disgusted, dresses as a nomad and spies on the enemy when she learns that an attack is imminent. Returning to her home camp, her warnings are ignored by the general to disastrous results. When the attack finally happens, the General is killed, but not before putting Mulan in charge. Mulan regroups the Chinese forces and defeats the nomads, but not before Mulan herself kills the General's erstwhile advisor. Returning to the Imperial capital, Mulan is offered a position in the Emperor's court. She turns the position down, asking only to return to her home. Returning to her feminine persona, she marries Liu Fendou.
