The series of short films has an all-dog cast  that recreate famous scenes from early musical films, particularly The Broadway Melody. The finale is a chorus line of dogs performing "Singing in the Rain" spoofing Cliff Edwards's original version of the song in The Hollywood Revue of 1929. Also spoofed is Al Jolson's performance of "Mammy" in The Jazz Singer. This was a part of MGM's popular series of Dogville Comedies shorts directed by Zion Myers and Jules White.
