{{plot}} James and Mollie, after struggling to put their kids, Mikey  and Julie  to bed, again have sex in their bedroom. She tries to refuse but her husband charms his way through her resistant behavior. Meanwhile outside, a pair of different breed dogs, having come from a night out are about to part ways. But the male dog, Trooper, instead cons the female dog, Princess, into mating with him after he lies and says that he is going to be fixed the next day. The screen changes for the credits of several of Trooper's canine sperm entering Princess' eggs. The owners of the spaniel discover that she has given birth and decide simply to put the dogs up for adoption. A few days afterwards, a young cross bred puppy is up for sale and we can hear him talking. He sees Mikey passing by him and begs him to take him home. He however has to hurry past in tow of his mother, and two harsh looking individuals buy the puppy. He manages to escape them and starts his life as a stray. James is a private air pilot working for Samantha - who we see has a crush on him and is always trying to extend the trips to spend more time with him. Mikey tells Santa that he wants a dog for Christmas. James feels the time has come to give him the present he has always wished for and tells Samantha about this. In the meantime, Mollie is a top accountant at her firm but because her salary is so high, she is suddenly laid off in order for the firm to save money. Unable to acquire a decent job, Mollie gets one as one of the elves for the mall Santa for the holiday season. During a visit, Mikey discovers to his horror that Santa Claus is a fake and becomes upset with disbelief. One day though the dog gets caught by the animal rescue force and taken to a kennel, where several other dogs are kept. He is about to be put to sleep on the same day that James brings Mikey there to select a dog. Overjoyed, Mikey bumps into the same dog he saw as a puppy, takes an instant liking to him and decides to take him home. Soon James and Mikey get home with the dog which Mikey has named Rocks, only to see that Samantha is at their house and has brought over her dog, Daphne, who is highly trained and she wants James to have her as a present from her. Mollie is angry when she discovers that James has gone and gotten a dog for Mikey without discussing it with her and the two have a brief argument. As Rocks will be put to sleep if he's returned to the kennel and James does not want to offend Samantha by refusing Daphne, the two realize they are stuck with two dogs. James compromises that whichever dog behaves better will stay while the other will be gotten rid of somehow. Mikey and Rocks, along with Julie and Daphne, begin a small series of sibling squabbles that irritate each child and their dog. Rocks, who had been getting threats from Mollie to be back out on the streets for eating her expensive shoes and peeing all over the floor, breaks the line by accidentally destroying Daphne's doghouse while playing fetch with Mikey. Daphne goes into Mollie's room and sets Rocks up by chewing on her shoes. Later that night when Mollie is sleeping, the dogs sneak out and have a night on the town. Daphne begins to stop being so arrogant and learns to enjoy herself and have fun. She also begins to see Rocks in a new light and soon falls in love with him, and he feels the same for her. When Mollie discovers her chewed up shoes she throws a fit screaming "You are out of here!" Mikey hears this and becomes upset. While being shut out on the patio, Daphne later apologizes to Rocks for her actions and it is discovered that he doesn't understand their attempts to train him to sit, lie down, beg, or any of the other standard tricks a dog is taught. As the world's most over-trained dog, Daphne proceeds to teach him the simple tricks that his family has been trying to do so. Mollie realizes that Daphne misses Rocks and talks to her about how someone can grow on you and after a while you can't live without them. Meanwhile, James and Samantha go to her partner's home cabin on Christmas Eve during a strong snowstorm. He fails to discover this is an elaborate setup to get them alone and stranded. She sends her driver away keeping James from leaving. She unplugs the phone and fax machine and plants a phony fax sheet clarifying that he  would not arrive until that night or early the following morning. Realizing he would possibly freeze to death trying to get out, James silently agrees to stay, giving Samantha the satisfaction that her setup was working. Mollie begins to suspect James is having an affair with Samantha when she calls her office and discovers the two are at a cabin in northern New York and her partner was in the Bahamas with his wife and family for the weekend, but is convinced by her mother  that James loves her and would never cheat on her. She calls back and under the guise of a flower delivery service manages to get the cabin's address. She gathers the children and the gifts to take Christmas to James. The family suffers a car accident when it slides off the snowy, icy roads and into the forest below the highway. a wolf appears and prepares to attack Mollie as she gets out of the car. Rocks rolls down the window and faces the wolf, attacking and scaring him away. He and Daphne decide to split up to get the family help. He sends her to find help while he follows James' scent. After Daphne straightens out the difference between 'sniff' and 'snort' she finds a forest ranger, and calls the squad to the car. While instructing Samantha to dance in the den under firelight, James looks up and discovers that the phone line has been pulled from the wall. He finally catches on to her ploy, dropping her promptly onto the floor. After she tells James he deserves better than a "frumpy little housewife who doesn't have the ability to find a decent job" Rocks appears at the door. She continues to threaten him, stating that if he walks out the door she will fire him and he won't find another decent job for the rest of his 'pathetic' life. Her voice is cut off though as Rocks urinates all over her feet and the two leave. After discovering that Mollie and the kids are no longer at the car, James and Rocks are confronted by a pack of wolves. Rocks defends James and as the attack happens off screen, there are the sounds of James' beeper and a dog's yelping, presumably Rocks'. Back at the ranger station, Mikey is looking out the window and he thinks he sees Santa hiking up the path to the station. All are surprised when James comes in the door. He explains that he was attacked by wolves and Rocks came to his rescue, leading Mikey and Daphne to believe sadly that he had been killed during this attack. James brings out his beeper, which has been crushed by the attack. Rocks appears and all is well again, apparently the sound of the beeper was what drove the wolves off and neither were hurt. After seeing that Rocks is obeying every command that comes out of James' mouth  Mollie votes that he stays, and they are one big happy family again. Daphne chooses Rocks as her mate. The ranger chimes in and states he's picking up a weird transmission on his radio. He turns the dial and Santa's voice is made out stating "Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!" much to Mikey's surprise.
