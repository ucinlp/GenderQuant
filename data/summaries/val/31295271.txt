Greg has just moved in with his girlfriend Molly who lives in New York City. They meet Trip and his lesbian friend Bridget. Molly and Bridget bond as they discuss Wuthering Heights and relationships. Molly says she has everything in common with her boyfriend but Greg lacks passion; Bridget says she doesn’t have a girlfriend because no one can hold her interest for long enough to bother. Trip annoys his girlfriend Chloe by blowing off a ballet performance to watch sports, but wins her back with a candlelit apology, her favorite dessert, and a self-deprecating dance. Greg drunkenly tries to force Molly into sex; she leaves him to stay with Bridget until he apologizes. At a New Year’s Eve party, Molly laments that she has never been thrown up against a wall and kissed. In the bathroom, Bridget does just that and the pair has breathless sex in the year’s final moments. Molly returns to Greg, but begins an affair with Bridget. Chloe catches Trip having sex with a random girl and leaves him. When Trip finds out about Molly and Bridget, he reports it to Greg, who forgives his girlfriend because “[she's] worth it”. Molly breaks off the relationship with Bridget and announces that she is marrying Greg. Later, at Molly's birthday party, Trip attempts to woo Chloe back, while Bridget presents her case to Molly with a simple, “I like you”. Greg throws Bridget up against a car in anger over her presence at the party, but when Chloe and Molly realize that both Greg and Bridget are missing, Trip pulls Greg off of Bridget. The film ends after Molly ends her engagement with Greg, and both Bridget and Molly lie in bed, staring at the ceiling. Bridget questions the look on Molly's face, to which Molly responds that the look indicates love. Bridget does not reciprocate this feeling, and both continue to stare at the ceiling, each speculating their next move.
