This documentary traces the careers of cinematographers László Kovács and Vilmos Zsigmond. These lifelong friends are Hungarian expatriates who had been studying cinematography in Hungary and defected following the 1956 Soviet invasion. Coincidently, they also photographed many of the tumultuous events during the invasion. Michael Goldman, of the Los Angeles Times, described their introduction to America: :"After a harrowing journey secreting the footage out of the country so it can be seen by the rest of the world, they end up in Los Angeles, where they toil anonymously in B-level biker films, wandering into Roger Corman's orbit. Soon after, both men flash to prominence filming several classic movies, playing important roles in the New Hollywood movement of the late '60s and '70s."Goldman, Michael.
