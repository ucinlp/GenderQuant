The film starts with a short introduction to the history of Portuguese exploration in the Age of Discovery to India, referring the legendary landing of explorer Vasco da Gama on 20 May 1498 in Calicut, the kingdom ruled by Zamorins of Calicut. The typical Primary School teachers narration  is initially accompanied with Google Image Search on "Vasco da Gama", followed by stills from his journey and moving images at the end. The meeting of Vasco da Gama  with Zamorin with traditional hospitality, and the failed interview to produce any concrete results is also depicted. Then the celebrations of the greatest discovery till in Lisbon is shown . In a party, da Gama is seen talking to his young son, Estêvão, who will later turn crucial character in the film. The scene changes to a club in present day Goa, where we see two young men, Krishna Das  and his friend, dancing. These two young men are running a music troupe and are completely unaware of the history or heritage of their land. From the agents of a multinational mining cooperation, Krishna Das knows that his ancestral property in Kerala leased out to a N. G. O. by his late mother is rich in minerals and is free to be sold as the lease period has lapsed. The company offers him a large of money as advance. Krishna Das is told that there some problems exist, that he has to convince the people running the N. G. O. for this transaction. When he reaches the plot, he is kidnapped by some tribal  men to cave deep in the forest, and where he meets their chief Thangachan . Thangachan explains to him that he is the descendant of Chirakkal Kelu Nayanar, and Thangachan resumes the narration. The narration continues with Portuguese activities in India, and effects of Colonization on the Malabar Coast. In 1502, Gama commanded the 4th Portuguese Armada to India, a fleet of fifteen ships and eight hundred men, with the object of enforcing Portuguese interests in the east. On reaching India in October 1502, Gama started capturing any Arab vessel he came across in Indian waters. On his way to Cannanore when he had reached the northern parts of the Indian Ocean, Gama waited for a ship to return from Mecca and seized all the merchandise on it. The Portuguese chases the pilgrim ship down, which surrenders rather quickly, probably imagining that its master and they had enough money to ransom it off. But Vasco da Gama shrugs off all the offers. The general of the king of Kolathunad, Chirakkal Kothuwal , sends a Brahmin negotiator and his own son, Kelu, to the Portuguese ship "São Gabriel" for negotiations on a Mecca Ship, "Miri". But, da Gama rejects all peace talks and barbarously cut off the Brahmin's ears and sews ears of his dog on the same spot. He then ordered the hundreds of passengers be locked in the hold and Mîrî, and which contained many wealthy Muslim merchants – to be set on fire. It took several days to finally go down completely, and general of the king of Kolathunad, Chirakkal Kothuwal storms "São Gabriel" to rescue his son, Kelu. But, on this charismatic attempt Chirakkal Kothuwal loses his life to the Portuguese, and only Kelu escapes devastated by his fathers loss. Vavvali, a Tamil Muslim boy, takes Kelu with him to his dwelling, and treats him as his own younger brother. Kelu forms an Urumi, specially made with the left over ornaments of the dead women and children of "Miri". He takes an oath that he will kill da Gama. Then it shows a foreshadowing of Kelu  and Vavvali  as adults hunting rabbits in a forest somewhere in Kolathunad. Where they are confronted by some strangers trying to abduct Bala , the princess of Kolathunad. Kelu and Vavvali save the princess, but they are subsequently captured by the soldiers of Kolathiri, accompanied by the heir apparent, Bhanu Vikraman  of Chirakkal. They are charged with attempted kidnap of the Princess and keeping foreign weapons such as pistol. Originally the pistol belonged to the real abductors, but the king's judgement was the execution by elephant. On the way, Princess Bala comes and reveals that these men are in fact saviours, not attempted abductors. Soon thereeafter they are told by the King to capture de Gama, however they instead capture de Gama's son. In the process, they come across Princess Ayesha of Arackel, a fiery warrior princess who fights any justice in her kingdom. However, as Vavvali and Kelu make their way through the kingdom having captured de Gama's son, they witness several men from the kingdom of Chirakkal gathering up the women who have been affected by the battle . Back in Chirakkal, the king bestow's Kelu with the honour of being the new general. Vavvali however is slightly unhappy as the king neglected to acknowledge his role in the capture of de Gama's son. Later, the women of Arackel are brought before the king. He immediately begins to ogle at them, especially Ayesha. She however, insists that she would be better suited for Bhanu than the king, to which the king agrees. Ayesha prepares for a night with Bhanu, however Bhanu  had initially had his eye on a young girl among the group. When he mentions that he wished that she too could join him, Ayesha strangles him. This had been her plan from the start, a plan foiled when palace guards arrive and take her away after Kelu restrains her. The king orders that she be 'spoiled' so that no one will dare to look at her ever again. As she is being taken away in a cage by guards, Kelu arrives and frees her. He tells her to leave and never return. Ayesha soon returns however to help the other women of Arackel still facing sexual and physical abuse at the hands of the king, Prince Bhanu and other men of the palace. At the same time, Kelu decides to help the women escape, as well as take de Gama's son from the king's custody – he feels that the king may not be the right person to seek in fighting against de Gama. Vavvali was supposed to bring de Gama, but in a mix-up de Gama is recaptured and Vavvali seen as the hero who caught him – he is given the honour of being co-general to the king with Kelu. Meanwhile, Kelu takes the women to safety in a nearby village; they are given medical attention. He then gives his urumi to Ayesha telling her to safeguard the women while he returns to Chirakkal to see what happened to Vavvali and de Gama's son. In Chirakkal he realises what has happened, and tells Vavvali that they must start their revolution against de Gama. They set out to all the nearby villages, with Ayesha joining their effort, destroying all hanging structures built by the Portuguese. As their support grew among all the peasants, members of the palace start to poison the king and the Prince Bhanu that Kelu and Vavvali are going to overthrow them. Meanwhile, de Gama is planning an attack to save his son. He sends in troops to Chirakkal, where they meet with Kelu, Vavvali, and Ayesha. A battle ensues, but they fall to the strength of Kelu and his fellow warriors. As the warriors take rest after the battle, Kelu and Ayesha finally admit their feelings to one another and embrace. Meanwhile, de Gama receives a box from India containing the severed fingers of his son, angering him again. Back in India, Bhanu seeks assistance from de Gama's son to obtain guns. He then meets with de Gama, and almost gets killed. In return for sparing his life, Bhanu helps de Gama's son escape. Bhanu also retrieves a deed giving  to . But when his father cannot accept his actions, Bhanu kills the king with the gun received from de Gama's son. News of the king's death reaches Kelu and his warriors. Kelu returns to discuss with Bhanu  what actions to take against de Gama, but Bhanu hesitantly states that the kingdom's army will not longer take orders from him. Kelu then confronts the member of the palace  who has poisoned the king's son's intentions. Meanwhile, de Gama's son returns to de Gama's fort. The princess of Chirakkal also asks Vavvali to take her with him, as she feels ashamed that her own brother killed their father. Vavvali agrees and takes her away with the help of some of the palace guards. Meanwhile, de Gama and his son return to Chirakkal to meet with Bhanu. Thinking it a friendly visit, Bhanu welcomes them only to be killed. Soon thereafter, de Gama comes with his troops in search of Kelu and his warriors. Initially it seems that de Gama's troops are retreating after losing heavily in the battle, but then de Gama's son shoots Vavvali. As Vavvali says his last words to Kelu  de Gama's son returns to his father to update him on their progress. de Gama instructs him to go back to battle. Kelu sets off to battle with a large army including Muslim Mappilas and Syrian Christians, coming face-to-face with de Gama's son and his army. As this final battle ensues, the audience finally finds out what happens to Kelu and the people he has been fighting so dearly for.
