Charles Coward  is a senior British NCO incarcerated in the POW camp Stalag VIII-B. He encourages his fellow inmates to escape, and tries to humiliate the German guards at every opportunity. He first attempts to escape by masquerading as a wounded German soldier. He is taken to hospital, where his identity is revealed, but not before being awarded the Iron Cross as he lies in his hospital bed. He then digs a tunnel, and, using a map he has obtained from the Polish resistance, escapes with fellow prisoner Bill Pope . They are captured at a train station. After the failure of that escape, they then manage to escape again by masquerading as workmen clearing rubble in a rural area. After learning that the American front line is only a mile away, they climb onto a handily parked fire engine. Their plan works - a German troop convoy on the road moves aside to allow the fire engine to pass through - and they drive the vehicle to safety.
