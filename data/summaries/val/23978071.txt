The film begins with Renzo Arbore and Luciano De Crescenzo driving in Rome, while discussing an original idea for a new movie. They pass under the window of real-life filmmaker Federico Fellini, who is writing a screenplay entitled F.F.S.S . A wind causes the screenplay to fall to the road below, and the two pick it up and decide to use Fellini's ideas themselves. Renzo Arbore plays Onliù Caporetto, a manager from Irpinia trying to bring success to Lucia Canaria . While travelling across Italy, they become involved in TV commercial in Milan, then go to Rome looking for a recommendation to work in RAI. Eventually they encounter Sceicco Beige , a music celebrity. They participate in the Festival di Sanremo 1983, where Raffaella Carrà sings Soli sulla luna and Ahi.
