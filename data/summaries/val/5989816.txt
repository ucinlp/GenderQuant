In a small Texas town, a man, while driving home on a back highway at night, claims to have encountered a UFO. Two reporters from a national magazine are sent to investigate the incident because their editor wants to publish a story on the controversial subject of UFOs. Brad  thinks UFOs are a hoax, Keith  senses that something is out there. Each man tries to prove the other wrong.
