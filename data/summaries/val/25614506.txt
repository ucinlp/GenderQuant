The story revolves around Banu Chandar, a forest officer by profession. He falls in love with a tribal girl "Tulasi" . He gets arrested by Police as they mistakenly identifies him as a Naxalite. In an unfortunate event, he kills a police man and gets life imprisonment. The whole plot runs in a form of story telling when Bhanu Chandar released from the jail and he happens to travel in a school bus. He hopes that Archana still waits for him even after several years of his jail, thus the name of this film "Nireekshana" which means The Waiting. The movie has borrowed from a Russian story ' The Yellow Hanky' and the scene where hero is arrested by cops is taken from Stallone's First Blood, which was released around same time.
