Frederick Clegg is a lonely young man who collects butterflies. After winning a large sum of money in a football pool, he buys an isolated country house and begins stalking pretty, young art student, Miranda Grey. One day in the city, Frederick kidnaps and chloroforms Miranda. He loads her unconscious body into the back of his van and drives to his house, locking Miranda in the windowless stone cellar that he has prepared with a bed, some furnishings, and an electric heater. When Miranda awakens, Frederick confesses his love for her, and explains that he only wants time for her to get to know him. At first, Miranda angrily demands to be released, but later agrees to stay for four weeks, but only if he gives her his word that he will let her go at the end of that time. Miranda stays locked in the cellar, except for occasional baths in the main house. At one point Frederick proudly shows her his massive butterfly collection. She is shocked by the living beauty he has destroyed, and realizes that he's "collected" her. Four weeks go by, during which Frederick discovers and prevents a number of clever escape attempts by Miranda. On the night of her promised release, Frederick surprises Miranda with a formal dinner and champagne. He presents her with a wedding ring and asks her to marry him. When Miranda agrees, Frederick becomes suspicious of her motives. They argue, and he chloroforms her and locks her in the basement again. During her next outing in the main house, Miranda attempts to seduce Frederick. He is appalled, and tells her he has lost all respect for her, and he can't allow her to leave. Miranda realizes just how unstable Frederick is, and that she will never leave alive. While being taken back to the cellar in the rain, she seizes a nearby shovel and strikes Frederick in the head with it. Frederick is wounded, but he manages to pull her back into the cellar, breaking the heater during their struggles. Frederick then drives his van to a hospital and is helped inside by a nurse. Miranda remains locked in the cold cellar, soaking wet. Frederick returns a few days later to find Miranda terribly ill, and he goes into town to get a doctor. There, Frederick stops himself from going inside the doctor's office, instead returning alone with some medicine. He enters the cellar to find Miranda dead. In a voice over, he says it was Miranda's fault for not trying to get to know him and for losing his respect. He reveals that Miranda is buried under a tree on his property in a box he made, and she got everything she deserved. He says his only mistake was trying to deal with someone like Miranda, who was much too clever and of a different social background. He has decided that he needs to find someone simpler and more common that he can "teach". The final scene shows Frederick back behind the wheel of his van, stalking a young nurse.
