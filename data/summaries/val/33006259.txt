It's summer, and 18-year-old Sean Roberts  has just graduated from high school. His high school teacher, 28-year-old Diane Marshall , is a neighbor and friend to his doting, if rather naive mother. Married to an often-absent drifter and therefore bored and frustrated, Diane sets out to seduce the shy youth, and a romantic relationship develops. However, in the shadows lurks an obsessive and vengeful stalker who has set his sights on the unsuspecting lovers.
