It is about 11-year-old Minerva played by Soleil Moon Frye, a girl who lives in a Las Vegas casino with her Uncle Howie played by Allen Garfield. Her uncle spoils her by giving her everything she wants. Minerva gets into trouble and her strict Aunt Hermione played by Edith Fields threatens to take her away. Dexter, a clever Mathematics professor, played by Paul Reiser finds out a foolproof way to cheat and win in blackjack, but he is caught. Dexter is burdened with a gigantic gambling debt. Uncle Howie makes sure Dexter tutors Minerva so she can gain admissions into a private school. It takes a while for this arrangement to work out between Dexter and Minerva, but finally they make great strides and Minerva amazingly learns everything very quickly. She runs away by herself to take the exam and pass. Meanwhile, Dexter and Uncle Howie's assistant Charlotte played by Mimi Rogers fall in love.
