When three great, has-been actors meet at the funeral of a legendary Hollywood agent, their alcoholic reunion leads them to visit the Hollywood Sign. There they find the body of a man - leading them to uncover an in-progress scam for stealing millions from a Las Vegas casino - which originated as a movie plot written by one of the actors' ex-girlfriends - who could not get her script produced. Desperate to make a come-back, the three risk their lives for production capital... by writing themselves into the "script."
