An unassuming pet photographer named Bryan  is thrown into serious action, adventure and romance when he's forced to marry Croatian bride Masha  to pay a debt to her criminal parents against his will. Masha's father marries her to Bryan to get her a green card, under the condition that Bryan can not touch her. Off to spend his honeymoon at a remote tropical resort, Masha's family friend Brick , who is in love with Masha , follows her and Bryan. After Masha catches Bryan dancing with a hotel waitress, she storms off as it is hinted she hates womanizers. Feeling bad, the waitress Lani  suggests Bryan take Masha on a romantic outing to a secret beach encased by a tropical rainforest to make it up to Bryan and Masha. While teasing Bryan at the secret cove, Masha flees into the rainforest and is kidnapped. While searching for Masha back at the hotel, unaware she has been kidnapped, Bryan finds that his psychotic assistant who is in love with him, Tonya , has tracked him down to the resort, bringing condoms, and tries to have sex with Bryan. After Bryan says informs her that he does not want to have sex with her, Tonya agrees to help find Masha, but tells him that she will one day force him to have sex with her, after trying to have sex with him one more time. After receiving a call from Masha's kidnappers demanding a ransom, Bryan asks Lani to help. While Bryan, Lani, and Tonya are making plans, Brick storms in and Lani and Tonya escape off the balcony, leaving Bryan to face Brick's wrath. When Brick finds a condom Tonya had brought on the unmade, wrecked bed, he infers Bryan was attempting to take Masha's virginity and hits him. Bryan barely escapes while Brick calls Masha's father back in America and informs him of Masha's kidnapping, making it sound as if Bryan had been the kidnapper. Meanwhile, the kidnappers turn out to be two American agents from earlier in the film. Back at the resort, when Brick tells Masha's father Vadik  about the condom and Bryan's supposed attempt to have sex with Masha, Vadik is enraged and begins to pack to fly to the island. Lani calls her cousin Ernesto  to help find Masha with his helicopter. Brick tries to shoot them but the entourage makes a hasty escape in Ernesto's helicopter, which crashes by a fishing village. Deciding to rest on a beach at the edge of the village, Ernesto and Tonya kiss passionately, unconcerned of Masha's dire condition, and Lani and Bryan storm off in anger. Alone, Ernesto and Tonya almost have sex in a boat in the grass, but Brick soon shows up and knocks them out, revealing that Brick is in on the kidnapping. Separated, Lani and Bryan obliviously go in separate directions. Masha escapes her prison in a surfboard shack and finds Bryan, who is crazily driving a Jeep stolen from Brick after he tried to kill Bryan. Bryan and Masha crash the Jeep, which erupts into flames, and make an escape on foot. Finding a canoe on a river, they outrun the three culprits and find a friendly welcoming old-time village. After eating a huge dinner and dancing and having fun, Masha and Bryan have sex for the first time. The next morning, they awake to a cheering village, but during breakfast the two agents and Brick find the village the next morning. Brick and the lovers battle on a steep ocean cliff. Just as Brick is ready to kill Bryan, Lani and Ernesto show up in the helicopter, catching Brick off guard. Masha, using the distraction, shoots Brick in the back and he falls off the cliff, taking Bryan with him. Masha is in shock, terrified with the thought that she killed Bryan too. Bryan appears in the waves, unharmed, and they are reunited with Masha's family back in America. Vadik gives Bryan his blessing to marry Masha for real, but he denies despite his feelings for her. Masha, heartbroken, continues her old life taking dance lessons. One night after her lessons, she finds Bryan outside ready to propose to her as he changed his mind. As the crowd around them applauds, the film ends with the camera panning away from the couple as they kiss. 'You May Not Kiss the Bride' Official Facebook Page
