Cayuco is a cinematographic documentary that heartrendingly narrates the penuries that Sub-Saharans have to go through when they embark on the trip through the desert and over the ocean in search of a better life. It's an intimate portrait of the harsh reality of illegal immigrants when they try to reach Europe via the Canary Islands.
