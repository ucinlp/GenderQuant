Teenager Angus  adopts a Yellow Labrador Retriever and names him Yellow. Several days later, while traveling along the coast of British Columbia with Angus's father, the boy and dog become stranded when turbulent waters capsize their boat. Angus's parents relentlessly badger rescue teams. Angus, schooled by his father in wilderness survival skills, and assisted by the intelligent Yellow Dog, tries to attract rescuers. Starvation, freezing temperatures, violent rainstorms, and a pack of wolves test Angus' and Yellow's courage and abilities to survive as they journey through the Canadian wilderness. Angus is eventually rescued but has to leave Yellow behind. Angus is later shown at home sitting on his porch; he blows his dog whistle and Yellow comes running back home.
