John Smith is ambushed by a group of soldiers with a warrant for his arrest and presumed dead in the ensuing confrontation; Governor Ratcliffe has lied to King James  and framed Smith as the traitor from the first film in a plot to declare war against the Powhatan Nation while avoiding punishment for his own crimes. In order to prevent this, the King sends a young diplomat, John Rolfe, to bring Chief Powhatan to England for negotiations. In the New World, Pocahontas mourns John Smith's death but is eventually able to move on. John Rolfe soon arrives, greeted by English civilians  and a curious Pocahontas. After an incident with a biased sailor, Pocahontas meets Rolfe, but is disgusted by his need to take charge; Rolfe in turn does not like Pocahontas's independent spirit. Rolfe later overhears two women talking about Pocahontas preventing a war, and assumes that "Pocahontas" is the name of the Chief of the Powhatans. That night, at a dance, Rolfe intrudes with a gift of a horse for "The Mighty Pocahontas." When Pocahontas steps forward, Rolfe finds himself in an awkward situation: the stubborn Chief will not go to England, but unless an envoy is sent, war will break out. Pocahontas volunteers, despite doubt and concern from others. Later that night, Grandmother Willow tells her to "listen to the spirit within." The next day, Pocahontas sets off for England with Meeko, Flit, and Percy stowing away on the ship, and a bodyguard  sent by the Chief. While on the ship, Pocahontas is nearly arrested by the captain as a stowaway, but Rolfe saves her, and they come to a truce. Upon arriving in England, Pocahontas marvels at this "new world." But Ratcliffe is only too happy to learn that she is there, a "lowly woman" instead of a chief, and hands Rolfe a proclamation signed by King James that says an Armada will sail if he is not pleased with the Powhatan ambassador. Rolfe and Pocahontas set out for his estate outside of London, where Mrs. Jenkins happily greets them and puts on tea, her trademark solution to a problem. Rolfe meets with the King, who, per Ratcliffe's suggestion, invites Pocahontas and Rolfe to The Hunt Ball. If Pocahontas can impress the King by appearing "civilized", the armada will not set sail, much to Rolfe's disgust. Rolfe is doubtful of the plan, but Pocahontas is determined to impress King James. Pocahontas dons a hoop skirt, high heels and a yellow ball dress, and is powdered to look white. Rolfe gives her lessons in dance and local etiquette, as well as a necklace, which she puts on in place of her mother's. She delights the King with flattery, and pleases the Queen. But during a bear-baiting , Pocahontas cannot stand by and watch the torture, and accuses the King and the laughing aristocrats of behaving like savages. James accuses Pocahontas of the same thing for defending the bear, and angrily orders Pocahontas and Uttamatomakkin's arrest, per Ratcliffe's suggestion, and plans to have them beheaded. Rolfe, his hopes of peace having failed, meets a hooded stranger who aids him in breaking Pocahontas and Uttamatomakkin out of jail. At a cabin in the woods the hooded man is revealed to be John Smith, who still has feelings for Pocahontas, and wants her to stay hidden, instead of trying to stop the armada. Rolfe wants Pocahontas to listen to her heart. Smith realizes Rolfe is in love with her. Pocahontas remembers her now-married friend Nakoma's words. Willing to risk her life for her people, she washes the powder from her face, goes before the king and convinces the Queen of the truth. And when John Smith appears, the King finally realizes that Ratcliffe lied about Smith's death and there being gold in Virginia. Pocahontas, Uttamatomakkin, Smith, and Rolfe then set out to stop the Armada. After they knock most of the sailors overboard and cause the ships to crash together, Smith bests Ratcliffe in a swordfight. Ratcliffe pulls out a pistol, but Rolfe and Pocahontas stop him. Ratcliffe is met on shore by King James, who finally arrests him. Pocahontas tells Rolfe that she plans to leave for home , and the two hint at admitting they love each other. Smith interrupts, telling Pocahontas he wants to travel the world with her by his side on his newly-awarded ship. Rolfe leaves, dismayed. Pocahontas gently tells Smith that their time together is over and they must part ways. Smith wishes her well, kisses her hand one last time, and leaves. Sadly, Rolfe has vanished. As her ship leaves port, Rolfe reveals he is on board, and Pocahontas runs to his arms. Pocahontas reminds him about his duty to the King, but Rolfe says that he has a duty to honor what is in his heart. They kiss as the ship sails into the sunset.
