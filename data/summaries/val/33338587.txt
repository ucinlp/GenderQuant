A group of neo-nazi skinheads violently rob a Jewish grocery. As they flee the scene of the crime, they eventually stop at a roadside diner where some traveling students are passing through. The skinheads terrorize the students and the owner of the diner, leaving two survivors who escape to the nearby Colorado mountains. The skinheads give chase but are met with opposition when they encounter a World War II veteran living in the woods who comes to the aid of the students.
