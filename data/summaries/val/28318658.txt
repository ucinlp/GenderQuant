The day of reckoning has begun. The souls of mankind rest in the unlikely hands of Sierra , an angry heroin-addicted college student, and Father Stone , a hunky young Catholic priest assigned to protect her. Unless Sierra returns some misplaced biblical relics to the Vatican, Satan and his army of evil knights will triumph. While Sierra battles her addiction, she learns to trust her friends Zak  and Nim , and tries to resist her increasingly romantic feelings for Stone. The attraction is mutual, but Stone refuses to jeopardize their responsibility to mankind and his commitment to the Church.
