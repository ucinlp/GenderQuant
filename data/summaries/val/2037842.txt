Set in the then-future of 1996, Harley Davidson  is in a motel in Texas when he hears about a dangerous new street drug named "Crystal Dream" on the radio. The significance of this street drug does not arise again until later in the film. Harley then meets a life long friend, a cowboy who is nicknamed The Marlboro Man  and they later plan a bank robbery to help save their friend's bar from being foreclosed and replaced with a skyscraper. However, after they rob a bank's armored car, they discover the cargo they stole is the designer drug "Crystal Dream", not money. Chance Wilder , who is a bank president involved in drug dealing, demands the return of the drugs. A series of increasingly deadly encounters ensue as heavily-armed assassins  hunt for Harley and Marlboro.
