Raja Vikramarka  is the prince of Skanda Dweepam, a small kingdom. He is unable to live his own life, eat his favorite foods, or brush his own teeth. His father  arranges his marriage with another kingdom's princess. She turns out to be nothing more than a sycophant, one without a brain or spine of her own. He leaves the kingdom with his trusted friend, Jockie , in order to live his own life. In the modern big city, he finds a friend and works as a mechanic, during which time he saves a girl  from two attempts at her life. Her uncle  hires him as her bodyguard. Rao later reveals to him that he was in fact the assassin trying to kill her for her money. In order to thwart his plot, Raja agrees to handle the murder attempts, while at the same time trying to save her. After being kicked out of the house, her uncle, along with the other villains  join forces to kill Raja and his parents. Raja saves the day and rules as king of his land. The first part of the movie is loosely based on Eddie Murphy's Coming to America.
