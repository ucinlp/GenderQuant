A small town's drama group is preparing for a Pocahontas-type play, when one of the member's English relatives suddenly arrives for a visit. This man, unlike the theater group, does not have any sense of humor, which sparks the relative and his friends to play practical jokes on him. They dress up as Indians to scare them, but the Englishman is so convinced, that he grabs his gun to shoot at them. At another moment, they try to get revenge by pretending to attack him, but the plan again backfires when the Englishman uses a prop gun from a heroine to horrify them.Review Summary The New York Times
