Jacob Glaser, disgraced award winning scientist and underground pseudo-science radio talk-show host, notices unusual spikes in the Earth's electromagnetic field which lead him to Stonehenge. Stonehenge has begun to move independently, build up an electromagnetic charge and release enough energy to vaporize people within a certain radius. Jacob theorizes that Stonehenge is actually at the center of a massive ancient terraforming machine, but must convince the scientists and military on site of this before it is too late and all life on Earth is destroyed in a series of volcanoes which are connected to Stonehenge through the Earth's electromagnetic field. Meanwhile Joseph Lesham - of the somewhat ambiguous past connection to Jacob - is actively working towards Earth's destruction in hopes that his followers  will survive the Apocalypse, waiting it out in a heretofore undiscovered pyramid in Maine, and become the progenitors of the next era of life on Earth. The conclusion is a race for possession of the device which controls both the pyramid in Maine and the electromagnetic terraforming machine at Stonehenge.
