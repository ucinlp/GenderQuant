Inspector Gagan Singh gets a tip about an infamous Tadipar "Munna", entering in his jurisdiction, so he checks Munna's file. Singh is shocked to find that Munna is none other than NCC Cadet Mahesh Deshmukh, an aspiring officer, whom he had met years ago in a bank. In front of the very eyes of Singh & Mahesh, a robbery took place and Mahesh's parents got killed. Singh never got to know what happened to Mahesh. Nevertheless, Singh tracks Munna and asks him to surrender. Munna tells him that he has to save his love Mohini from the clutches of dreaded gangster Lotiya Pathan. He reveals that he shifted to Mumbai with his sister Jyoti after the incident. He met a girl named Mohini and fell in love with her. Mohini's father Shyamlal didn't like this relationship. Shyamlal was a drunkard who mooched off the money earned by his dancer wife. When she finally stood up to him, Shyamlal burned her face with sulphuric acid. She died soon afterwards, following which Shyamlal forced Mohini to follow her mother's steps. Shyamlal has taken a loan from Lotiya and the only way to repay it is to make Mohini dance. But Mohini does not give up and continues meeting Mahesh. Shyamlal traps Mahesh along with Guldasta, a local tea vendor and sends duo behind bars for six months in charge for trespassing house with intention of robbery. Shyamlal meets Chote Khan, younger brother of Lotiya who joined him after completing his term for robbery case. Chote Khan was arrested due to Mahesh. Lotiya doesn't know Mahesh's identity. Shyamlal instantly recognizes Mahesh and explains everything to Lotiya. Chote goes to Mahesh's house and tries to rape Jyoti as revenge. Mahesh averts this and kills Chote. Mahesh is arrested and sentenced to one year jail, after which he becomes Munna and gets exiled. After serving his sentence, Mahesh starts destroying Lotiya's empire with help of his friends. As a revenge, Lotiya kidnaps Mohini. Shyamlal now deals with Munna to get Mohini rescued. Mahesh rescues her, but she is shocked to see that Mahesh is sending her back to her father. When Mohini reaches home, she and Shyamlal have an altercation. Mohini is saved by Guldasta, who kills Shyamlal. Lotiya kidnaps Mohini again. On learning the whole story from Munna, Singh allows him to complete his task. In a bloody aftermath, Munna and his friends finally destroy Lotiya's empire fully. Lotiya gets enraged and goes to attack Munna. Baban deflects the attack and gets killed. Munna kills Lotiya and completes his revenge. After saving Mohini, Munna surrenders unconditionally to Singh, whereupon he gets arrested and sent to prison.
