So the 8-year-old is brought by her mother, Tanya , to Melbourne to diagnose the reasons for her continued silence. Amy befriends her neighbor, Robert, and while social workers try desperately to get her to speak and go to school, she makes the choice to communicate again and begins to sing along to Robert's rock songs after three years of silence. Her mother works out her own emotional issues with the help of a therapist.
