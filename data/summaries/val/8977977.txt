Ollie is in the hospital with a broken leg. Stan pays him a visit, bearing a thoughtful gift of hard-boiled eggs and nuts. Stan causes so much trouble that an angry Dr. Gilbert orders both patient and guest out of the hospital at once. Before leaving, Stan accidentally sits on a hypodermic needle filled with sedative. He attempts to drive Ollie home, but is nearly asleep at the wheel, and the car careens wildly through the streets.
