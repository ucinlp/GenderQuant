Johnny Casar runs away from a home for wayward boys, tired of being teased about being short and a poor athlete. He gets a job as a dishwasher while a priest who runs the home, Father O'Hara, secretly keeps an eye on him. A traveling roller-skating team takes an interest in Johnny after he shows some aptitude. He clashes with Mack Miller, a cocky champion, and falls for Mary Reeves, another top skater. Johnny ends up featured in grudge matches against Miller, where they take turns one-upping one another. As his fame grows, Johnny becomes every bit as arrogant as Miller and more. Life takes a bad turn when he is diagnosed with polio. A long period of physical therapy follows, until a wheelchair-bound Johnny tries to get his life back on track.
