Set on the fictional Pacific island of Talua in French Polynesia, some 500 miles from Tahiti, Father Doonan , has been relieved of his duties by Father Perreau . Father Doonan has fallen out of favor with the island's residents because he stumbled on the island's carefully hidden secret  among the children of the islands. He built a hospital for the children up the island's volcano. Meanwhile, three convicts Harry , Charlie  and Marcel , en route to Tahiti, make an unexpected stop on the island and they are put to work at the leper hospital. All is seemingly normal until the island's volcano begins to erupt and the Governor  orders an evacuation. The governor cannot reach the freighter that has just left the island and plans to evacuate the island with one seaplane and a schooner. The children are still on the slope of the volcano in the hospital and Father Doonan is desperate to rescue them. When the freighter suddenly appears back at the island, Father Doonan convinces the island's governor to drop some men to rescue the children. The schooner agrees to wait until 4:00 PM the next day for them before he has to leave due to the tides. The convicts agree to parachute to the hospital with Father Doonan to rescue the children and staff of the hospital in the hope of getting their sentences commuted by the authorities. They face fire, lava, earthquakes, and dwindling time to escape to safety. All must work together if any are to survive. Eventually, most of the children and the staff are rescued and board the schooner. Prisoner Marcel drowns in a mud pit. Charlie is fatally hurt when the bridge he is holding up to reinforce collapses and fatally injures him after everyone else is across. Father Doonan stays with him. Harry sees the children and staff to the schooner and goes back to wait with his friends. He is trapped on one side of the chasm while Father Doonan and Charlie are on the other side. Father Doonan gives Charlie the last rites when he dies and begins to ask for forgiveness for his sins as the entire island explodes  in a volcanic paroxysm.
