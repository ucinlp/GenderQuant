Alberto is a jeweler whose wife, Silvina, has kicked him out of his house because of his slovenly lifestyle. Having no other place to go, the newly divorced Albert asks his friend Mauricio if he can stay at his home. Mauricio is the owner of an imported car dealership and lives a very neat, routine, and quiet lifestyle -- the opposite of Alberto. The entry of Alberto into Mauricio's life and their radically clashing personalities results in both awkward and hilarious situations.
