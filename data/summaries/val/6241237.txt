Three women start a lunch wagon business, but run into resistance from their competitor Mr. Schmeckler  when their business starts interfering with illegal activity that Schmeckler is involved in. While Schmeckler busies himself trying to sabotage their wagon, the women are busy falling in love with construction workers and rock stars. Meanwhile, two bumbling diamond thieves create complications for both sides. It is most notable for being the first major exposure for the band Missing Persons, credited here as "U.S. Drag", with their songs "Mental Hopscotch" and "I Like Boys" featuring prominently on the soundtrack.
