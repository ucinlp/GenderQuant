Archaeologist Kwok Tun-wong brings his two students with him in search of ancient artifacts. They stumble upon a cave and discover three geung sis . The vampires are immobilised because they have Chinese talismans with spells written on them stuck to their foreheads. Kwok brings the corpses back to his lab and decides to sell the child vampire in the black market. While transporting the boy vampire, Kwok accidentally strips the talisman off its forehead and breaks the charm. The creature awakens and escapes. It enters a house by chance and befriends a little girl, who mistakes the young vampire for an illegal immigrant boy. Meanwhile back in the lab, one of Kwok's students mischievously removes the talismans from the adult vampires and revives them. The vampires start to "hop" around and attack people. It took the three men much trouble to put them back to rest temporarily. One of Kwok's students was bitten by the male vampire while fighting it so he goes to see Dr. Lam for treatment. Lam recognises the bite marks and concludes that there are vampires running loose in town. Together with his daughter Gigi and prospective son-in-law Yen, Lam decides to embark on a quest to destroy the vampires.
