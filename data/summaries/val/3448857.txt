Mr. Quincy Magoo  is an eccentric millionaire with very bad eyesight who refuses to use eyeglasses and therefore always gets into trouble. During a museum robbery he accidentally gets a priceless gem called the Star of Kuristan, and begins to trace the way for the arch-criminals whose idea was to steal the gem - Austin Cloquet  and Ortega "The Piranha" Peru , while two federal agents Stupak  and Anders  lead the manhunt for Mr. Magoo himself.
