The film centres on the life of a strong-willed Armenian fighter Nahapet . In the horrors of the Armenian genocide, Nahapet  and others valiantly attempt to defend their village in Turkish Armenia from Ottoman troops but are soon overwhelmed. All his children and his wife, Manushak, are brutally beaten and killed whilst he is tied to a beam and forced to witness the destruction of his village. Left for dead, Nahapet is able to make his way to a bleak and cold village in Aragats , a part of the new state of Soviet Armenia. He is filled with grief and feels unable to move on. With encouragement from his brother-in-law and friend Apro , Nahapet reluctantly begins a new relationship with a woman named Noubar . But the pair are estranged from one another from the start and the scenes from the film show candid but silent moments of the two attempting to find ways to build a new lives and trying to survive with what little they have. They plant trees and labour intensively to build a house despite the harsh weather conditions of the region. Nahapet and Noubar gradually realise that their survival and future is linked and both now come to the aid of one another. She reveals to Nahapet that she is pregnant. As Nahapet is working outside one day he, he hears the wailing of a newborn and rushes to his home's wooden door, collapsing on it with the tears and with the full realisation that building a new future after suffering such deprivations in life is possible. The film ends with him and the other villagers walking with their children as they all take a pledge to plant a new apple tree for each child born in the village.
