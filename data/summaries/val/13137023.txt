As the story unfolds, we meet the three main monsters: Frank, Drac, and Wolf, the werewolf. They were once the scariest of monsters, but now they have become associated with "fun." The three end up on a TV show called Foolish Monster Tricks, which is witnessed by three new modern monsters who decide to have them thrown out of the Ghoul Guild. They are then called before the Court of Horrors just before Halloween for "failure to scare". The Prosecutor  presents evidence that they are inept as monsters  but the jury ends up deadlocked, so the Judge says that they must prove that they can still be scary, and if they fail they will be sentenced to an eternity of entertaining at children's parties. They are given 24 hours to terrify a typical family, the Tinklemeisters: cleaning-obsessed Mom, overworked dog-groomer Dad, average daughter Stella, and youngest child Spike, who was struck by a bolt of lightning as a child. Since then, he has never spoken, and only whistles to communicate, and has developed a bizarre knack for weird experiments. The three monsters first attempt to scare them by cutting into their TV reception and showing their old horror films, but that attempt fails miserably, so they go with Plan B: they stage a fake game show, and make it seem that the Tinklemeisters have won a one-night stay at their castle. The monsters then scare the Tinklemeisters one by one: first Dad, Then Mom, then Stella. when the monsters try to scare Spike, he easily defeats all three of them, and then frees his family, who have been locked in a closet. the monsters then call a truce with the Tinklemeisters and explain their situation. Then, the three modern monsters show up and reveal that they were sent by the Prosecutor, who is unwilling to risk losing the case. Frank, Wolf, Drac and the Tinklemeisters escape, and then the Tinklemeisters and Spike use all of their skills to revamp the monsters and restore their youth and all their abilities, using a potion created by Spike to turn everything black and white, fully recreating the monster's glory days. then, the three new monsters arrive, and after a brief battle, Frank, Wolf, and Drac easily defeat them, but run out of time in the process. the next day, with the Tinklemeisters watching on TV, the Prosecutor claims that since the threesome didn't scare the Tinklemeisters, they should be sentenced immediately. However, the Judge tells the Prosecutor that the threesome did something better than scaring a typical family-scaring three of their own kind! Spike then shows up as a surprise witness, and reveals that since he read so many horror comics, he became an expert on monsters, but was too scared to speak for several years. he then delivers a passionate speech which convinces the Judge to reinstate the monsters into the Ghoul Guild. the monsters are then inducted into the Monster Hall of Fame, give their castle to the Tinklemeisters, and open a theme park on the castle grounds, which they use as a new way to haunt the population for fun.
