Harry Doyle  and Archie Long  are gangsters who have served a 30-year prison sentence for hijacking a Southern Pacific train called The Gold Coast Flyer, ready to collect their Social Security. Upon release, they are briefed on how their new lives will be. Harry, at age 72, is committed to a retirement community, despite his desire to work . Archie, still allowed to work, takes a job at an ice cream parlor and later a restaurant. They're also instructed that they're not to have further contact with each other. It also turns out to be the first of many conditions of their parole that they ultimately violate. Both are in for a shock at how much the world has changed from 1956 to 1986â€”clothing, sexual lifestyles , lack of respect by the younger generation, and the advance of technology. Archie's young manager treats him poorly and Harry is denied proper food by a nasty orderly and the even worse manager. Harry attempts to recreate a 1940s lifestyle with a woman of his generation named Belle  and reminisces about old times. Meanwhile Archie embraces the contemporary scene; listening to New Wave music, asking out a much younger woman named Skye  and dressing in a much younger man's faddish clothes. Though both their sexual / romantic relationships go well, neither Archie or Harry seem to fit in anymore with wider society. Their parole officer, Richie Evans  seems more a fan of historically notable criminals than a representative of law enforcement. Meanwhile, a hit man of their generation, Leon B. Little , still has an outstanding  contract on them, even though he can barely see his targets. Bored with their new lives, Harry and Archie decide to hijack the Gold Coast Flyer again. The train is on its last run, being pulled by Daylight 4449, and the two old-timers are going to run it full throttle to the Mexican border. To their surprise, Leon has arrived and forms a truce with the two and Richie  is driving the train. Unfortunately the tracks end a few feet from the border. Harry throws Leon from the cab with the hit man saying he'll get them even if it takes another 30 years. Archie takes Richie up to the coaches and uncouples the train telling Richie that if he gets into trouble tell the police that he was kidnapped. Harry and Archie drive the 4449 through a fusillade of bullets from U.S. border police. They crash the fence, burying the engine partially in the soil of Mexico a few feet across the border, surviving without a scratch, tough guys to the end, just as the Mexican border patrol arrives to arrest them. However, they appear to try to cheat the law once more as they attempt to dupe the Mexicans, leading into the closing credits.
