Charlie, an awkward, well-natured young man, has recently been released from prison. Attempting to re-initiate his romantic life after a decade in federal containment, Charlie finds that his criminal history is a hard fact for women to accept, when he strikes out with his co-worker, Beth. With no role models, Charlie turns to his impatient parole officer, Sheila. Though she’d rather take care of business than hear about his problems, Charlie manages to squeeze motherly support out of her from time to time. He also finds 'support' in his best friend Chester, a fellow ex-con who fits the criminal role more than Charlie. After horrible let downs and awkward dating situations, Charlie finds Amy, a down to earth coworker who he thinks might just be the one to accept him. With Sheila’s help, Charlie allows their relationship to grow without letting Amy know about his past, until the moment when he is finally forced to reveal his secret.
