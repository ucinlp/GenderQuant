Brock is involved with industrialist Abner Dillon , who is the show's "angel" . But while she is busy keeping Dillon both hooked and at arm's length, she still secretly meets her old vaudeville partner and lover, the out-of-work Pat Denning . To ensure success Julian Marsh , who is the best, is hired to direct. But Marsh is ill, destitute, friendless, and bitter as a result of the 1929 Stock Market Crash. "Did you ever try to cash a reputation in a bank?" he asks the producers who are surprised to hear his desperation. Gambling with health and life, Marsh must make his last show a major hit and financial success if he is to have enough money to retire on. "This time I'm going to sock it away so hard you'll have to blast to get it out" he says after signing up to direct, referring to his financial situation. Cast selection and rehearsals begin amidst fierce competition, with not a few "casting couch" innuendos flying around.
