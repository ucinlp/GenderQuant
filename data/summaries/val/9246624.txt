In 1977, Claudio Tamburrini  was a goalie for a minor league soccer team when he was kidnapped by members of the Argentine secret military police. He is taken to a detention center known as Sere Mansion: an old dilapidated house in the suburban neighborhood of Mor√≥n on the suspicion he is an anti-government terrorist. Tamburrini is tortured by his jailers frequently. Yet, they look for information he does not have because he is not a political activist and never was. Tamburrini expects to be killed by the ruthless guards at any time. After four months of imprisonment, and many sessions of torture, Tamburrini and his fellow captives Guillermo , Vasco and another man dive out a window during a rainstorm. The four, naked and with nothing but their senses, began a desperate flight to freedom.
