A son is born to a young couple in pre-war Italy. The father, motivated by jealousy, takes the baby into the desert to be abandoned, at which point the filmâ€™s setting changes to the ancient world. The child is rescued, named Edipo by King Polybus  and Queen Merope  of Corinth and raised as their own son. When Edipo  learns of a prophesy foretelling that he will kill his father and marry his mother, he leaves Corinth believing that Polybus and Merope are his true parents. On the road to Thebes, Edipo meets Laius , his biological father, and kills him after an argument. Later Edipo solves the riddle of the Sphinx. For freeing the kingdom of Thebes from the Sphinx's curse Edipo is rewarded with kingship and marriage to queen Jocasta , who is his biological mother. When they discover what they have done, fulfilling the prophecy, Edipo blinds himself and Jocasta commits suicide.
