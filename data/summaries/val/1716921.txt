Fictional television station WIDB-TV  experiences problems with its late-night airing of science-fiction classic Amazon Women on the Moon, a 1950s B-movie in which Queen Lara  and Capt. Nelson ([[Steve Forrest  battle exploding volcanoes and man-eating spiders on the moon. In place of the faltering film, the channel airs various other movie clips, trailers, commercials, public service announcements, infomercials and talk shows in between a few snippets of the main feature. These segments feature: * Arsenio Hall as a man who nearly kills himself in a series of mishaps around his apartment; * Monique Gabrielle as a model who goes about her daily routine in Malibu, California, completely naked; * Lou Jacobi as a man, zapped into the television, wandering throughout sketches looking for his wife; * Michelle Pfeiffer and Peter Horton as a young couple having trouble with eccentric doctor Griffin Dunne delivering and then concealing their newborn baby; * Joe Pantoliano as the presenter of a commercial recommending stapling carpet to a bald head as a hair loss prevention measure; * David Alan Grier and B.B. King in a public-service appeal for "blacks without soul"; * Rosanna Arquette as a young woman on a blind date, employing unusual methods of investigation to reveal the past indiscretions of Steve Guttenberg; * Henry Silva as the host of a show entitled Bullshit or Not?, clearly intended as a spoof of In Search Of . . .; * Archie Hahn as a man who dies after a critical mauling  and is roasted at his funeral by a variety of people, including his wife; * William Marshall as the leader of a gang of pirates illegally bootlegging videotapes; * Ed Begley, Jr. as the son of the Invisible Man, having trouble with his formula; * Angel Tompkins as a First Lady who is also a former hooker; * Matt Adler as a sexually frustrated teenager who becomes a spokesperson for a condom company; * Marc McClure renting a personalized date video; * and an epilogue at the end of the credits, with Carrie Fisher and Paul Bartel in a black-and-white ephemeral film warning about the spread of "social diseases" in the style of Reefer Madness.  An alternate version of the "Pethouse Video" sketch was filmed for the television broadcast of the film, with Monique Gabrielle in lingerie instead of appearing naked throughout the segment. Most European TV broadcasts of the film, however, retained the original theatrical version. Bullshit or Not? was retitled Baloney or Not? for the TV version. The American television edit, in addition to the alternative "Pethouse Video" sketch, features a additional bridging sequence between the death of Harvey Pitnik and his subsequent celebrity roast. In it, the mortician successfully cons Pitnik's widow into having the celebrity roast as part of the funeral. The DVD release features an unreleased sketch titled "The Unknown Soldier," starring Robert Loggia. Some television broadcasts of the film featured the sketches "Peter Pan Theater" and "The French Ventriloquist's Dummy," which were not present in the theatrical version.
