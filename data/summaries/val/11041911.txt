India-based artist Shomu and his wife Geetu are happily married with two children. Shomu decides to travel to Britain for business purposes, as well as to meet his childhood friend, Ravi Kapoor. Once in Britain, Shomu finds himself getting close to single women and realises that he is ready for an extramarital affair. Ravi, to the contrary, believes that Shomu is the luckiest man on earth, as he is in love with his wife and their marriage is rock steady. Distrusting her husband, Meenu asks a British-based friend to check on him. The friend reports back that Shomu lasts long in bed. Geetu decides to go to Britain as well and catch Shomu red-handed. In the meantime, Ravi meets a waitress named Menaka Choudhary and decides to propose marriage to her, apprehensive that she, too, will turn him down. The stage is all set for sparks to fly.
