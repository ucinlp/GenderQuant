Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck have to sell books for Rambling House. They go their separate ways and experience many wacky things. After a little while, Bugs comes across Sultan Yosemite Sam's palace in the Arabian desert. Sam needs someone to read to his spoiled brat son, Prince Abba-Dabba . When Bugs first meets the tyke and gets mocked, he objects to the idea of reading to him. Then, Sam threatens to make Bugs bathe in boiling oil, at which point Bugs agrees to read to Abba-Dabba. Bugs tries to escape on a flying carpet from the palace, but Sam catches him. Meanwhile, Daffy stumbles upon a cave of gold and tries to make off with the treasure. But a genie does not like what he was doing and chases him out of the cave. Daffy wanders through the desert and soon sees the palace, hoping to sell books there. Bugs luckily escapes and tries to warn Daffy about the palace, but he would not listen. He found out the hard way and the two walk off with Daffy missing all of his feathers. Most of the rest of the movie consists of the stories played out as classic cartoons. Some of the classic cartoon shorts were abridged. In the One Froggy Evening sequence, the ending where the construction worker from 2056 finds Michigan J. Frog and makes off with him was cut, making it seem as if the cartoon ended with the construction worker from 1955 getting rid of the frog and running off. This was the first Looney Tunes compilation film to use a completely original story and treat the included cartoon shorts as part of the story, as opposed to having the characters introduce the cartoons.
