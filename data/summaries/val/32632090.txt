Andrew ([[Jase Blankfort  and his older brother Carl  enjoy listening to ghost stories that the local undertaker, Mr. Bennett , tells them. One night Bennett tells the tale of a local farmer whose wife gave birth to conjoined twins, one being good-natured while the other was clearly evil. The farmer, ashamed of them, kept the twins locked in their room. Eventually the twins got sick and died together, so the farmer sawed them in half and buried the good twin in a cemetery and the bad twin in a shallow grave near the house. Later, Andrew and his friends decide to hold a seance in the cemetery where the good twin is buried, but they unintentionally awaken the bad twin who was accidentally buried in the cemetery instead of the good son. Gradually, the bad twin possesses nearly everyone in town, and it is up to young Andrew to stop him.Cry Baby Lane Synopsis - Plot Summary - Fandango.comCry Baby Lane - detailsCry Baby Lane - MSN Entertainment â€“ Movie Details
