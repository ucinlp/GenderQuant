Set in 1947 during the Partition of India, the film tells the story of a truck driver, Tara Singh , a Jatt Sikh, who falls in love with a Muslim girl, Sakina , belonging to an aristocratic family. The story begins with Sikhs and Hindus being attacked by Muslims in Pakistan when trying to migrate to India on a train in response to the killing of Muslims going to Pakistan from India. To get revenge, Sikhs and Hindus react by doing the same thing. During the Hindu-Muslim riots that erupted soon after the Partition, Tara saves Sakina from a murderous mob chasing her as she failed to get onto the train after being pushed and lost in the crowd. As the mob want to rape her and then murder her, Tara Singh defends Sakina and disguises her as a Sikh to protect her. While driving back to Tara's house, the story has a major flashback showing the relationship between Tara and Sakina before this incident and how they knew each other. Tara is a lorry driver, but his real ambition is to become a singer. Some girls in college who are friends of Sakina fool Tara into thinking that they have got him a spot on an annual music show in return for him doing a favor for them. Tara performs badly in from of the music teacher, who is portrayed by Sakina . His friend then gives him tablets that help him prove his singing skills. Soon after it is shown that Sakina is not the real music teacher, which saddens him. When performing on the music show Sakina announces that she will not do her act, instead giving Tara a chance to sing despite being against the will of the seniors at the college. Subsequently and back at the present, Sakina starts living in Taraâ€™s house and their respect culminates into love. Sakina and Tara Singh get married and become parents of a baby boy. Their life seems like a bed of roses, until Sakina sees an old newspaper that has a photograph of her father , whom she believes had been killed during the riots during the Partition. Her father is now the mayor of Lahore. When Sakina calls him from the Pakistani Embassy in Delhi, he arranges to fly her to Lahore. However, Tara and their son, who are supposed to accompany her to Lahore, are told at the last minute that their visa formalities have not been completed, which compels them to stay in India. This does not stop Tara. He and his son accompanied by a friend enter Pakistan illegally at the border. There they find out that Sakina is getting married and reach her before the marriage can start and reunite. Seeing this, Sakina's husband-to-be attacks Tara but is instead injured by him. A large fight was about to break out until the priest stops them, as this can end up harming Sakina's father's career in politics. Ashraf Ali  agrees for their marriage under two conditions: they should live in Pakistan and Tara should adopt Islam. These conditions are accepted by Tara in public the next day which was against Ashraf Ali's plans. He makes Tara insult his country to make him believe he is a true Pakistani, which enrages him and this makes him kill the mob that was hired by Ashraf to kill him. Tara, Sakina, their son, and a friend manage to escape.
