Jeanne, a young woman born and raised in Northern France, is visiting the Mediterranean for the first time. She arrives at the southern French seaport of Toulon to attend the wedding of her older sister Maïté to Nourredine, a north African. However, her main goal is to repatriate her deaf-mute younger brother Alain with whom she had been living following the death of their parents. Alain, however has run away with Saïd, a French man of Algerian descent who approached Jeanne on her arrival in the city. Alain supports himself as a pickpocket under the tutelage of Saïd. Jeanne must therefore locate her brother. Jeanne's first lead in finding her brother is the struggling orchestra conductor Klotz, a bisexual older man who is infatuated with Saïd. When Jeanne visits Klotz's luxurious beach-side villa she meets Klot'z son Stéphane, who is recovering from a coma, and Stéphane's overbearing mother, Myrian. When Jeanne finds Alain, she moves into the modest hotel he shares with Saïd, which is run by a repatriated Pied-Noir from Algeria. At the same time Jeanne starts a relationship with Stéphane, but there is a secret link between Stéphane and Saïd. Saïd takes Jeanne to see a burns victim and reveals to her that Stéphane had once been part of a far right racist gang which had set fire to an immigrant hostel, and was later stabbed by Saïd in revenge. During a brief stay in Algeria, Saïd telephones Stéphane to tell him of the night he has spent with Jeanne, which motivates Stéphane to denounce Saïd to the racist gang. However, Stéphane catches up with Saïd and warns him not to go back to the hotel. Saïd, however, drags Stéphane with him and they are both shot dead. The film ends with Jeanne staring at the two bodies.
