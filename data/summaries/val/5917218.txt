Two poor boys from London, an abused child and the son of a whore attempt to stowaway on a ship bound to Jamaica to escape their lives of misery and squalor. It is on the exotic island that one of the boys' fathers is believed to be currently inhabiting. They manage to get aboard by stealing a suitcase from a Rolls Royce belonging to a wealthy shipping businessman but are caught and subsequently scolded and sent home. Later an elderly fellow tells that there are many ships leaving.
