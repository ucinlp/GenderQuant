Julian  gets a call from his friend Terry  who explains to him that he had earlier that day received a call that his fianc√©e, June , has cancelled her flight. Terry had followed her and discovered that she had checked out a room in a local hotel, after which Terry rents out the room across the hall from June believing she is cheating on him. Terry explains to Julian that, earlier that evening, he had gone to Julian's house, and finding him not home, broke in and stole Julian's gun, and that he is now "about to fuck up." Worried that Terry is about to kill someone, Julian tries to reason with Terry on the phone not to do anything, but after having no success, he tells Terry to stay where he is and wait until he meets him at the hotel in about 20 minutes. During the film, it is revealed that June had canceled her flight because of Julian and that they were cheating behind Terry's back. Terry finds this out when he kills June and tries to call Julian, whose cell phone was still in the hotel room that June and Julian cheated in. Terry tricks Julian into helping move June, framing him for killing her while the police storm the hotel.
