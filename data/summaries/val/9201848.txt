In 1876, a young trader named Tom Doan ([[Jack Holt  arrives at Sprague's Trading Post where a group of buffalo hunters has assembled. Fresh from his Kansas farm, Tom meets and falls in love with Milly Fayre ([[Lois Wilson , the stepdaughter of Randall Jett . Unknown to Tom, Randall is the leader of a gang of notorious outlaws who make a brutal living robbing buffalo hunters. After Milly and Tom are separated, an Indian uprising occurs, sparked by the irresponsible slaughtering of the buffalo herds by white adventurers. Jett is killed by his own men, but Milly is able to escape. Attempting to make her way back to civilization, Milly is pursued by a band of hostile Indians and falls in front of a herd of stampeding buffalo. Tom rides in and rescues her just in time. The Indians are subdued by the buffalo hunters, and Tom and Milly head back to civilization.
