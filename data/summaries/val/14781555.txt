After being cursed by their mother, a caveman brother and sister are forced to live their lives by preying on young people in a park and devouring their entrails in order to stay young. After 12,000 years of killing they attempt to lift the curse and become immortal by finding a virgin's soul they can sacrifice, with the brother fathering a daughter for that purpose.
