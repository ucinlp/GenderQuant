In the bored suburban atmosphere of a Canadian city, Scott  decides to throw a celebratory get-together with friends in his parents' home. Unfortunately, there's a catch: Scott's parents happen to be particularly anal about the direction the carpet fibers lay and the distance from doily to table-edge. This means that the only part of the house that is safe, that is, the only part of the house with no carpeting and therefore no potential mess, is the tiled kitchen. The festivities begin once the parents go off to a party of their own, leaving Scott and his buddy, Wayne , with a house that would be entirely empty but for Scott's mysterious brother lurking in the basement. Soon the girls are arriving, including Scott's girlfriend, Tammy  — whom he plans on bedding before the night is over — and alcohol, drugs, music, more people, and everything else that characterizes a stereotypical house party follows. This includes calamity, as Scott quickly discovers just how much can go wrong in one night of kitchen partying.
