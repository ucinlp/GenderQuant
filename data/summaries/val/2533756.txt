In four elegant brothels, called "Flower Houses", in fin-de-siècle 19th-century Shanghai , several affairs are described. The action involves four drunkards, and takes place mostly in candlelight, giving the film a claustrophobic feel. Preparation and consumption of opium and tea are at the center of the business operations. We are introduced to the main characters, mainly the courtesans known as Crimson, Pearl, Emerald, Jasmine and Jade. Crimson belongs to Huifang brothel; Pearl and Jade to Gongyang brothel; Emerald lives at Shangren brothel; and Jasmine works at East Hexing brothel. The relationship between the wealthy patrons and the courtesans are semi-monogamous, frequently lasting many years. The courtesans are purchased at an early age by the owners of the brothels, otherwise known as "Aunties". In spite of the trappings of luxury and the wealth surrounding them, the graceful, well-bred courtesans live lives of slavery. Although there are only a few references to the courtesans being beaten, we are led to understand that there are frequent beatings for the girls and women with harsher Aunties and that beatings for perceived misbehaviour are common. Because of the oppressing social conventions, the best that the courtesans, known as "flower girls", can hope for is to some day pay off their debts  or marry into a better social status. The silent master Wang leaves the courtesan Crimson in favor of Jasmine, for which it was within only 10 days of a fire and flame after  2½ years. He offers to settle Crimson's debts. Wang sees himself in repeated connections and between hardening fronts. Dependence turns out as reciprocal. Crimson has only master Wang as a customer, and must sustain herself from his money to feed her entire family. Emerald was worth 100 dollars as a child once. Master Luo wants to redeem that value. The prostitute Silver Phoenix is abused by her drawing mother. Master Wang has a drunken rage accumulation, and lets it loose, when he finds out that Crimson goes foreign. A contract over Emerald is put into play, and a notary comes to log the inventory. Allegedly Wang strikes Jasmine, who then attempts to commit suicide. Jade tries to poison her customer, with whom she had sworn her eternal love. For one arranges thereupon a marriage. Crimson, for master Wang, at last prepares an opium pipe in the quiet blissfulness of being together.
