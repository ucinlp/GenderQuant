Sam Phillips  and his child Tony  are playing outside their farm. The father is abducted by a strong light. Three years later, the light returns, and plants a seed. A half-human half-alien creature grows up, and when it moves it is run over by a car. Ben  is attacked and killed when he looks for the runaway man. Jane  is also killed. The creature  moves to a cottage nearby and attacks a woman , leaving her pregnant. When she returns to consciousness, she gives birth to a full-formed Sam and dies. Sam steals Ben's clothes and drives his car, without bothering to get rid of Jane's corpse, which will be found by a lorry-driver  Sam seeks Tony, who lives in a condominium building in London, with his mother , her new boyfriend Joe Daniels , and a French au-pair Analise Mercier . Rachel and Joe are professional photographers and share a studio downtown. Many nights, Tony has got nightmares. He wakes up soaked in blood, but it's not his, as the family doctor  discovers. Sam picks Tony up from school, until Rachel finds them. Although Joe doesn't like it -he intends to marry Rachel- Sam goes to live with them, saying he can't remember anything. Tony sees him eating his pet snake's eggs and runs from him. Sam goes after him, talking to him smoothly, and drinks his blood. Rachel finds Jane's photo in Sam's clothes, but he can't remember her either. Tony discovers he has certain powers now, so he sends a human-size soldier toy  to kill their nasty neighbour Mrs Goodman , in revenge for killing his pet snake. Also, a teddy-clown becomes a human-like clown  Sam and Rachel both decide to visit their former residence, the farm, while leaving Tony at Analise's regard. However, she brings Esteban, her boyfriend, and they make love. Tony demands to play hide-and-see with her. She does so, only to be used as a kind of womb for the alien eggs by Tony and the clown. Tony sends a toy to kill Esteban. He discovers Analise and runs away, but a puma kills him. The building-keeper is also killed when Rachel asks him to watch Tony, as nobody answers the phone at home. Sam and Rachel make love in the abandoned farm , but she gets afraid because his skin starts to bleed and decompose. Joe has taken Tony there. Sam and Tony go up a hill towards the alien light. Sam has become a disgusting skeleton, but shouts and kills Joe. Tony's skin is also decomposing, but not so much. Rachel goes back to the flat on her own, only to be attacked by the clown and panther.
