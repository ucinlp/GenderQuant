John is skeptical about the film, but Paul ([[Andrew Scott  convinces him to go through with the idea. John then invites his father to his mansion to live with him. Freddie Lennon arrives and meets his grandson, Julian. Sitting with his wife, John reads the criticism of Magical Mystery Tour, while comparing his wife to Brigitte Bardot, whom he says he will meet after he returns from India. John finds a letter addressed to him, with the word "Breathe" written on it. Later, after finding his father in a neighbor's house, Freddie reveals that he has a 19 year old girlfriend named Pauline, with whom he wants to live. Lennon accuses his father of leaving him again, and then leaves, after telling his father that he won't live with him anymore. After meeting Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the Beatles quickly return to London, and in a press conference they say they made a mistake when they trusted Maharishi. The journalists are curious about the Beatles new business -- Apple Records. At night, before meeting Derek Taylor, John glimpses Yoko Ono from a window. John reveals to Derek that she sends him letters --one of them, the "Breathe" one. Derek and John go to meet Brigitte Bardot, and in the car John tells Derek he sometimes thinks he is Jesus Christ. Derek tells him that being John Lennon is enough to "walk on water". John is nervous about his meeting with Brigitte, and takes a tablet of LSD along with Derek. The next morning, John returns home, and during his drug-trip, he remembers the public's reaction at the "more popular than Jesus" statement he made two years before. He gets into his pool, and his wife Cynthia demands that he gets out. John says that he can't walk on water after all, and Cynthia and Julian leave.

Yoko arrives and records an album with Lennon, which would become Two Virgins. They spend the night together, and John tells Pete that he wants to live with Yoko. Some time later, Yoko and John hold a gallery event in which they set free various white balloons, and John says that "he's setting them free, including him". Cynthia demands that John stop his adultery with Yoko. Cynthia is willing to forgive John, but John doesn't care and chooses Yoko. While John is leaving, Julian is seen playing with a ball all alone, and he throws the ball at John. John, however, throws it away and doesn't pay attention to his son. All through the film, John has memories about himself in the Blackpool docks, when he was six years all. In a meeting with the Beatles, Derek is worried about releasing a double album, because Apple is losing money. After losing patience with Paul, John and Yoko leave the meeting and go to their house, and take a picture of what would be the cover of Two Virgins.
