According to Horrorfest Online, six people with a common past converge years later at the funeral of an old friend. While putting the affairs in order, a map is presented to them. They follow the directions to find a long-lost time capsule from their youth. The search is requested by the dead friend in common between them, and the journey the group takes not only takes them on a journey to the time capsule, but on a journey down memory lane as the friends realize the importance of their quest. Their journey takes them through twisted halls and old memories resurface, memories they had long repressed. While each member of the group suffers through the traumatizing memories, the memory of a little dead girl brings each of them to work together to escape the children's home they once had to live in. While they try to escape though, the old forgotten girl seeks to help explain their quest and to lead them each to their own peculiar demises.
