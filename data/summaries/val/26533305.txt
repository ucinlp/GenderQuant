In México City, a Cuban dancer from "Cabaret Changó" rescues a baby from a garbage can and decides to raise him, but her pachuco pimp gets in her way. Immediately after Aventurera, Ninón Sevilla was top-billed in "Victimas del pecado" . Powerfully directed and co-written by Emilio Fernández, here is a movie that almost tops its predecessor in noir ambiance and gritty effects. Particularly striking is the use of black smoke from passing trains to color Junco's cabaret which is literally located on the wrong side of the tracks. Our old friend, Rodolfo Acosta, gives his most chilling portrayal ever as the unscrupulous heavy whose flamboyant style is neatly contrasted by expressionless yet charismatic Tito Junco. Sevilla, of course, is once again in her element as the swirling dancer with a heart of gold, although Fernandez has obviously ensured that the musical numbers are more realistically presented. In fact, even the obligatory song by Pedro Vargas is better integrated into the narrative  and Vargas himself is much less stiff than usual. And, as might be expected, Figueroa's low-key photography is a stand-out, as are the gloriously cavernous, seedy sets designed by Manuel Fontanals. In the support cast, Rita Montaner is delightfully over-the-top , while Poncianito makes his shoeshine boy as solidly believable as Margarita Ceballos enacts her pitifully weak Rosa and Francisco Reiguera his squalidly hawkish yet often ineffective manager.
