Chris Hardwick introduces a series of "clips" with Astrid, a veejay for a mediocre music television station. It is soon obvious that Astrid is incredibly stupid, having no clue about the people she interviews or what she even does. Throughout the film, she interviews Taye Diggs  and Coolio, who is too busy eating to give her decent answers.
