The story follows three surfers Jody Wallis ([[Fabian , Steamer Lane  and Chase Colton ([[Peter Brown , who come to Hawaii's Oahu Island to ride the world's biggest waves and compete against surfers from all over the world. Steamer falls in love with Lily Kilua , whose mother objects to the romance because she considers surfers to be "beach bums," since her husband--a surfer--left home and family to follow the surf circuit. Self-described college dropout and surf bum Jody falls for the demure Brie Matthews , who challenges him to return to college. In the case of the relatively straight-laced Chase, he finds himself pursued by the adventurous Augie Poole . The main story, though, is the challenge to surf the monster waves at Waimea Bay, and fit in among the champion surfers there such as Eskimo . Despite conflicts, injuries and rocky romances, Wallis, Chase and Steamer prove themselves brave—or crazy—enough to try to be the last one to ride in the highest wave.
