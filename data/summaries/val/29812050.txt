Donald Duck takes his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, to sea in a large schooner. Donald acts as a strict, old fashioned navy captain and is particularly proud of his admiral's uniform and large bicorne hat. However, their problems quickly multiply as the ducks prove to be incompetent at weighing the anchor and hoisting the sail. Just as things are going completely haywire, a hungry shark appears and nearly eats Donald. Donald leads the shark on a frantic chase just barely escaping death at each turn. Finally the shark causes Donald to ruin his hat. Donald's fury at seeing his hat ruined gives him enough determination to confront the shark, punching him in the nose in a full head on collision effectively knocking the shark out.
