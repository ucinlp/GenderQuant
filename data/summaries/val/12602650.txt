The film centers on two young women &mdash; one an Orthodox Jew, the other a devout Muslim &mdash; who meet and become friends as first-year teachers at a public school in Brooklyn. Over the course of the year they learn that they share much in common, not least of which is that they are both going through arranged marriages.
