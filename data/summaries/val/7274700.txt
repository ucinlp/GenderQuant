Duncan Marsh , a mild-mannered man, finds himself lost in a remote village called Mountaincrest. His mind is clouded, but he learns later that Emory Forrest  and Morgan Chambers , two scientists, injected him with a special serum containing irradiated wolf's blood when he was suffering from amnesia after being in a car accident. The wolf's blood, for unknown reasons, changed the previously gentlemanlike Duncan into a vicious, bloodthirsty werewolf.
