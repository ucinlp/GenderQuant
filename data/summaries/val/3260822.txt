The film's protagonist, Ryan  is devastated and depressed after his girlfriend Glauren  breaks up with him. Ryan is convinced that she's sleeping with someone else but cannot prove it. After attempting to call Glauren several times, she finally returns his calls to reveal this she is in fact seeing someone named Hellboy, but denies sleeping with him; however Ryan does not believe her. He angrily runs to the local coffee house where he finds his friend, Valo . Valo tells Ryan he is acting like an idiot and that he needs to control himself, and that he should try and talk to some other girls. He tries his luck with a girl in the coffee house, but after he insults her, she stabs him in the eye with a fork; Ryan screams with pain before passing out. Once home, Ryan, now wearing an eyepatch, asks Valo to vandalise Glauren's house for $100 to get revenge -- he believes it will help him get over her. Ryan says he will also pay Falcone  to do it as well. Valo agrees and goes to seek out Falcone. He finds Falcone in his house building a 'Reverse Microwave' for a local Future Inventions competition. Valo tells him about Ryan's proposition and Falcone reluctantly agrees but only because he needs money for microwave parts. Ryan and Glauren then meet and decide to get back together, but Ryan is unable to contact Valo to call off the break-in. Falcone insists that his cousin, Raab  be the get-away driver for the break-in, much to Valo's objection , but Valo later agrees. During the break-in, Falcone and Valo discover Glauren's personal effects, such as her underwear, vibrator, and diary. Falcone reads passages from her diary on video to show to Ryan. Before they can leave the house, Glauren returns home with Hellboy. They begin to have sex when they notice the video camera on the dresser, at which time Valo and Falcone are chased out from the closet they are hiding in and outside the house by Hellboy. Valo and Falcone escape and jump into the car just as Raab drives away, hitting Hellboy in the process. The three of them return to Ryan's, who is in an extremely happy mood after getting back together with Glauren. They show him the video recording, which shows Falcone reading the sexual extract from Glauren's diary and the Hellboy sex scene. Ryan grows extremely angry that Glauren betrayed him. Falcone wins the Future Invention competition with his Reverse Microwave, and he, Valo, and Ryan are invited to the after-party, where Valo hooks up with a girl and Ryan gets a new girlfriend named Heather . Glauren arrives and tries to seduce Ryan, but he denies her. Glauren storms off angrily, while Ryan remains happily with his new lover. Valo's girlfriend, Heather , invites him back to her house, where they begin to make out. Unfortunately for him, Hellboy arrives, revealing himself to be the girl's brother, and Valo hastily escapes. The next day, Valo and Falcone are seen in the park, where they laugh about Valo's experience with Hellboy. They then walk away, happy that everything is as it should be.
