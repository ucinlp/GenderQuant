In the summer of 1980, Beth Easton and her recently-widowed mother move from Los Angeles to a small town in Washington in an attempt to reassemble their broken lives. At first, Beth misses L.A. and resents their new life in the country, but a chance encounter with the outspoken and free-spirited Jody Salerno piques Beth's curiosity about the town. Jody, a social outcast with a troubled homelife and an alcoholic mother, shares Beth's love for 'Winnie the Pooh' stories, and the two girls become fast friends. Looking for adventure, Beth and Jody make plans to explore the mysterious caves below Bear Mountain, where legend tells of a long-lost gold mine buried deep within the mountain's treacherous depths. However, Beth and Jody are not the only people hunting for this treasure, and the two girls must rely upon their wits, their courage, and the power of their friendship if they are to survive this ordeal and strike it rich.
