As he investigates the missing person report of a teenager named Chris Gant , Des Plaines, IL detective Lt. Joe Kozenczak  becomes concerned that local businessman John Wayne Gacy  may be responsible for this and well as many other disappearances. However, when he and his team are ready to arrest Gacy, their evidence is viewed as being circumstantial. Worst of all, everyone  view Gacy as a respectable pillar of society. Meanwhile, Gacy himself begins a sadistic game of cat-and-mouse as he tries in every way to manipulate and outwit the police. After eventually achieving two search warrants, Konzenczak finds a large amount of incriminating evidence, as well as 29 bodies buried throughout John Gacy's property; the remaining 4 are found dumped in a nearby river, including Gant's remains. Afterwards, he is charged with the rape and murder of 33 boys and young men and convicted, being sentenced to death.
