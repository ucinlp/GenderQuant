Everyone goes into the theatre where Channel 5 reveals they have hired Glenn Quagmire to provide them with a bootleg copy of the film, we then see an advertisement for a new Disney movie, "The Littlest Bunny", and another film, "People Who Look Like They Never Sleep..." starring Susan Sarandon and Vince Vaughn. After this, the film begins.  When the Griffins go swimming at the Quahog Community Pool, Peter tries teaching Stewie to swim and attempts to toss him into the pool despite Stewie begging to be put down. Lois takes Stewie to swimming lessons where Stewie meets Brad, a child about his age who is "The Star Swimmer". In jealousy, Stewie does everything he can to steal Brad's glory. As a last resort he tries to kill Brad by rigging a lifeguard chair with dynamite and luring Brad beneath it with marzipan; however, Stewie's detonator malfunctions, blowing up the legs of chair causing it to fall on Stewie. He ends up in hell where Steve Allen seems to try and rape him ; when Stewie is revived by Lois, he believes it is a sign for him to be a good boy. After learning the new video store - Lackluster Video - will not give Peter pornography to rent, Peter vents his frustration in front of Tom Tucker, who gives him a job at Quahog 5, hosting a segment called What Really Grinds My Gears, in which he rants about things that bother him. Peter becomes extremely popular, overshadowing Tucker, who is fired after attempting to distract Peter during filming. Stewie attempts to be a good boy by smothering Brian with affection. Brian finally goads Stewie into reverting to his old, violent ways by crushing a spider web and eating the spider. Stewie starts drinking heavily, following Brian's way of coping. Brian attempts to cure Stewie of his alcoholism by taking him out for a night of drinking at the Drunken Clam. While drunk, Stewie crashes Brian's car through the wall of the bar. Knowing Stewie is Peter's son, Tom takes advantage of the situation and presents footage of the accident at the news station. Peter is fired and Tom is rehired as the anchor. The next morning, Stewie has a hangover and has the words "Property Of Roger Moore" emblazoned on his chest  and realises his lonely existence in the world, and wishes that there were someone else to whom he could relate . At the end Stewie says it is good he stopped drinking now so it would not have any repercussions later in life; then Roger Moore, shown in his mansion holding a napkin with Stewie's number on it, calls him and hangs up after one ring. This episode when broadcast in Canada was subject to a complaint to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council in 2011. The council ordered Global Television must apologize to its viewers for not warning them about the violence from a scene where Elmer Fudd kills Bugs Bunny with a rifle during a July 23, 2011 airing of the Family Guy episode "Stewie B. Goode". The Council stated "The panel finds that the scene was definitely somewhat gruesome and uncomfortable to watch. It recognizes, however, that the scene was intended to satirize the violence found in that type of cartoon program. The gag was somewhat tongue-in-cheek since Family Guy itself is an animated program that sometimes contains violence."http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2012/120301.php  Peter buys a TiVo box for his TV - as it was mentioned in the previous episode he wanted a VHS Player to replace the old one they first used in "A Very Special Family Guy Freakin' Christmas", but Jim Kaplan, the recurring sales/insurance man deters Peter easily. Stewie spots a man in San Francisco on the news that has the same face and hairstyle as him. Stewie then believes that he may be his true father. Learning that Quagmire is going on a cross country tour in which he plans to have sex with a different woman in every state of America, Brian and Stewie hitch a ride in his RV. At a motel in New Jersey, Quagmire is handcuffed to a bed and mugged by the latest woman. Then Stewie and Brian drive off with his RV leaving Quagmire at the motel. Quagmire, however, manages to turn on a porno movie so he can arouse himself to the point where heâ€™s able to use his erect penis to call 9-1-1.

After wandering through the desert, they find a Dr. Pepper vending machine, but they realize it was RC Cola and they do not drink it. Stewie and Brian manage to get a rental car and arrive in San Francisco. Stewie mysteriously leaves Brian and confronts the man from TV on a cable car, and is shocked to discover that the man is actually Stewie from 30 years in the future.  "Stu", as Stewie's future self is called, tells Stewie that he is on vacation . Stu reveals he cannot tell anyone about his time and leaves for his time, Stewie stows away with him. Stewie learns he will not become ruler of the world but rather "a 35-year-old Parade magazine-reading virgin". Stu passes off Stewie as a Nicaraguan boy named Pablo to everyone until Stu can send him back. Stewie learns he will also work at the Quahog Circuit Shack and still lives with Rupert, his childhood teddy bear in a filthy apartment. Disgusted with the way his life will turn out, Stewie remodels Stu's apartment and gets him to lose his virginity to his co-worker, Fran. The next day, Fran tells everyone about it since it involved only eight seconds of sex and forty minutes of Stu crying, costing Stu his job for having relations with a co-worker. Returning home, he finds that his apartment is in flames due to the stress-relieving candles Stewie put there. His life now ruined, Stu laments the day of his near-death experience at the community pool, revealing that memories of the experience will re-surface when Stewie is twenty, causing him to repress and preventing him from taking any risks.
