One day a woman named Neeli was ostracized from the Hindu society because she became pregnant before marriage. Pookoya Thangal gave her a place to stay in his servant's house. The servant Thangal's wife, Aatta Beevi , was also pregnant. Neeli died during childbirth of a baby boy. Aatta Beevi gave birth to a baby girl. Neeli's son was named Kunhali and Thangal's daughter's name was Pookkunhi Beevi. Kunhali stayed in Thangal's house. Thangal's wife hated the presence of Kunhali and he was sent to Pathu's house where he was raised up by Pathu. Both Kunhali and Pookkunhi reached in the stage of higher studies. Kunhali joined for M.B.B.S and Pookkunni Beevi for Degree. At this time Thangal made his daughter to learn Nangyar Koothu, a Hindu ritual art form. After she learned Koothu, a performance was organised in a temple. Some members of the Hindu community did not tolerate the act and opposed.
