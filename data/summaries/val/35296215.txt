When Gilbert Barrows  disobeys his boss and tries to refit an old Liberty Ship for cargo use instead of scrapping it, he inadvertantly puts it into the hands of a colorful group of crooks led by good-hearted screw-up Bugsy G. Fogelmeyer  and brainy sociopath George M. Wilson . The crooks plan to use the ship to make their getaway after they pull a bank robbery in Boston, and they kidnap Barrows and his girlfriend Elinor Harrison  &ndash; his boss's daughter &ndash; to prevent leaving any witnesses behind. With the help of Bugsy's nephew Rodney J. Fogelmeyer , Gilbert and Elinor manage to foil the crooks' plans by using Elinor's bra as a slingshot and attracting the Coast Guard.
