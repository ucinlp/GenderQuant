Omni Consumer Products  has the city of Detroit in a corporate stranglehold. They have forced a police strike and are attempting to take over the city government with plans to demolish the old city and put up a planned community development in its place. A new designer drug named "Nuke" has been plaguing the streets. The primary distributor, Cain, is a cult leader with a Messiah complex. RoboCop confronts Cain and his gang at an abandoned construction site. However, they render RoboCop immobile and slice him to pieces, though he remains alive. RoboCop is saved when OCP's Dr. Juliette Faxx takes charge of the new RoboCop team, which includes the development of a more advanced "RoboCop 2" and wants to choose a criminal with a desire for power and immortality. She finds the perfect subject in Cain, who is badly injured after a revived RoboCop persuades the striking police force to help him attack Cain's hideout. Cain's successor Hob arranges a secret meeting with Mayor Marvin Kuzak, offering to bail out the city's debt to OCP, but only if he agrees to a hands-off policy regarding the distribution of Nuke. Since this would hinder OCP's attempts to take over the city, they send RoboCop 2 in to kill everyone. Everyone but the mayor is killed. RoboCop arrives too late, but learns of RoboCop 2. During the unveiling of Delta City  and RoboCop 2 at a press conference, Cain flies into a rage and opens fire on the crowd. RoboCop arrives, and the two cyborgs battle throughout the building, eventually falling off the roof and into an underground facility. They continue to battle on the street below until RoboCop kills Cain. The OCP President, executive Johnson, and OCP lawyer Holzgang discuss the company's liability for the massacre, and decide to scapegoat Faxx.
