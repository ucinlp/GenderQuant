Just after the election, K.G. Ramachandran , popularly known as KGR is elected as the new Chief Minister. A young Turk with a clean image, KGR overshadowed Kazhuthumuttam , another strong aspirant for CM's chair. Just after the meeting, Kazhuthumuttam joins with Eranjoly Aboobakkar  and Mathai Chacko Pappachan  at a hotel room, to plan out the next move. Vishwanathan, commonly referred as Vishwam , a high profile business tycoon and political lobbyist joins them at the hotel. Vishwam, the political sponsor of Kazhuthumuttam is now in deep trouble as he has several business ambitions in the state. Vishwam has collected several million rupees from several businessmen, whom he had also given promises. If KGR continues in power, his plans would be tarnished. KGR, on the other hand leads a simple life along with his wife Vatsala, a home maker. He brings out several revolutionary changes in the state, including dismissal of corrupt officers and changes in liquor policy of the state. Even Kaimal ([[Janardhanan , his party president finds him too arrogant to tame. The popularity of KGR is on sudden rise. It was then, Vishwan, decides to assassinate KGR. He puts out the plan in front of his friends, who also agrees. Vishwan contacts Muniyandi Thevar, a Malaysian based businessman and smuggler in Madras, who introduces him to a professional hit man . But after the payment of the amount is done, Kazhuthumuttam feels cheated as again, he has been denied the CM's post. Kazhuthumuttam, in a state of intoxication, calls up Gopu , a journalist and spits out the information that 'the Chief Minister will be assassinated shortly', but without committing his identity. Even though the caller does not give his name, the journalist identifies him as Kazhuthumuttam. He therefore passes the information to a friend of his, Perumal , a police officer . Perumal doesn't seem to take this serious at first, and since the identification of the voice of the caller by the journalist is not positive, they conclude it is a prank call. Still they convey the message to the higher officials. Th IG of Police, still not thoroughly convinced, orders a routine investigation into the matter. Perumal is assigned the case and he begins his investigation by arresting Vishwam. But Vishwam couldn't give them any further details as he was also unaware about the whereabouts or name of the killer, except that the killer has introduced himself as Gomes, a fake name. Perumal reaches Madras, from where, he arrests Thevar and brings him to Kerala. According to an eyewitness, Perumal issues a sketch of the killer and gets it broadcast on TV, but he skips from police miraculously. On the day of August 15, when the CM is checking the guard of honor, Perumal waits eagerly with all police facilities to grab the killer. While scanning the CCTV feeds, Perumal observes Gomes among the police in uniform, in the line for the guard of honour. . Perumal sprints from the Control room and shoots down Gomes, before he can hit the CM, thereby saving KGR. The final scene shows the burial of the assassin Gomes, where a deputy questions Perumal how he knew he was a Christian. Perumal replies that he doesn't and actually he is an unknown man , but he is paying respect to the assassin going by the last name he was known to Perumal, subtly implying that the assassin had earned some grudging respect from him, possibly for his determination.
