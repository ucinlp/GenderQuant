After the 2004 Asian tsunami disaster strikes, four independent volunteers, with little money and no experience, race off to volunteer in tsunami ravaged Sri Lanka. They meet up by fate at Colombo airport and decide to form a volunteer team. They rent a van, fill it with supplies and start driving down the coast to see where they can help. They stumble into a tribal village called Peraliya, which has been destroyed by a forty foot wave. During the time the wave hit Peraliya, a train called "The Queen of the Sea" which happened to be passing by at the same time was derailed and washed away killing over 2500 passengers and villagers. No-one was there helping so the volunteer team set up a first aid station and find themselves in charge of looking after a refugee camp with over 3000 people. Their initial two week journey turns into a year long odyssey of heartbreak and hope as the villagers slowly begin to turn against them when the worlds donated tsunami money doesn't materialize. The volunteers concentrate on the bigger picture and push on through the death threats and break every rule in the 'Disaster Aid Books'.
