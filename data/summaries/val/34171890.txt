As the film begins, it is 1934, and Hamilton as the civilian-turned-detective is called back to Chicago only to discover that his brother is on death row for murdering his wife. Unable to save him from the electric chair, Hamilton is nonetheless convinced of his brother’s innocence and is determined to clear his name. His searches lead him to the Loveland Ballroom, where his brother was involved in a dance marathon  run by Milland, and where the murder allegedly happened. Soon, the pursuit turns supernatural, as Hamilton begins seeing his dead brother walking the foggy streets and a man  Hamilton killed climbs out of a coffin and attacks him. Police Officer Meeker, of course, doesn’t believe Hamilton’s story, and when the two of them show up at Blondell’s antique store, Nalder is alive and well. At the center of all this weird activity is a man named Varrick whom no one has ever seen…The film depicts people being brought back to life, not realizing that they are dead, but forced to do the bidding of a man who resurrects them as zombies using magic he learned in Haiti. Bloch's opinion of the movie is given in his autobiography, Once Around the Bloch: ""The Dead Don't Die". Maybe they don't, but the show did. Despite Curtis's casting of accomplished character actors, their supporting roles couldn't prop up the lead. And Ray Milland, who had given such a deftly paced performance in my script for Home Away from Home, merely plodded through his part here like a zombie without a deadline."
