The entirety of the film is narrated by a detective, Joe Morton, who has "been working for the Greater Plantsville Police Department for 30 years." We are introduced to the main characters in the film as they prepare for school one morning. Sarah, the leader of the gang, is a Hitler-idolizing, iron cross wearing, society- and life-hating Jewish teenager. Rawhide, na√Øve and innocent, admires John Wayne. Fleabrain is a strong and dopey girl. Dorothea is the fourth member. The girls drink alcohol, briefly visit and then cut from their classes at the St. Jerome's School for Girls, terrorize a series of males in the town, and return to the school for an "afternoon tea dance." The band performing at the dance is David Nudelman and the Wild Breed. At the dance, Dorothea is found collapsed on the floor, and the remaining three girls spend the rest of the film hunting down and enacting their revenge on the perpetrators.
