While her sailor husband is away, Nellie Jennis  receives a visit from her brother Jack , who is being sought by the police for an attack on another man. Jack claims he is being wrongly accused as his actions were in self-defence, and Nellie agrees to shelter him for a while until he can make good his escape. When her husband Bob  returns home, he finds evidence which Nellie has overlooked indicating that a man has been staying in his absence. He assumes the worst and is consumed by jealous rage. Nellie refuses to break Jack's confidence by telling Bob the truth, and becomes so fearful and distraught about Bob's treatment of her that she flees from home, taking their baby with her. Nellie finds employment with Lord and Lady Lafene, who are happy to let her keep her baby with her. Before long however, Lord Lafene starts trying to take advantage of her and she runs away again. Now homeless, destitute and with no means to look after the baby, she returns home in secret and leaves the baby for Bob to care for. Meanwhile Jack's trouble with the police has been sorted out and he visits Bob, who now realises that he had suspected Nellie unfairly. He and Bob go looking for Nellie and finally manage to track her down. Nellie and Bob are reconciled.
