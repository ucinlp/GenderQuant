Sue, Cheryl and Lexi are three college freshmen who have been best friends since they were born on the same day. They do something special every year for their birthday, but on their eighteenth, they set out to lose their virginity. They throw a large poolside party at Sue's house hoping to "pop their cherries" before the day and night is over. But they find that losing their virginity is easier said than done as all three of them embark on a series of raunchy and hilarious quests to do so. Cheryl sets out to "make it" with her long-term boyfriend Jake. But after she catches him cheating on her with another girl, she embarks on a string of unsuccessful hook ups, one of which include trying to seduce the local blind kid Frank whose seeing-eye dog has an encounter with her instead. Next, Cheryl tries to make her boyfriend jealous by hooking up with a friendly college guy, named Eric, but he leaves when she is only trying to seduce him as "revenge sex" against her boyfriend. Lexi tries to find a certain "J.J." who gave her "oral pleasure" on the previous day, but does not know who it is. She sets out to find him any way she can by coming onto every guy she meets with the first name of 'J', from Jeremy to Jake, to John. The naive and religious Sue first tries to seduce her Bible study classmate Chris, who rejects her advances, claiming that his devotion lays with Jesus . Dejected, Sue becomes hooked on masturbation as she sets to pleasure herself with everything that vibrates in her house, from vibrators, vacuum handles, remote controllers to electric toothbrushes. At the end of the party, none of the three girls lose their virginity despite having sexual encounters with various persons, animals and objects. Deciding that it was not meant to be, they leave the house and go their separate ways. However, Lexi discovers that J.J. is actually her old high school classmate, named Johanna, who always had a crush on Lexi. Realizing that she might really be a repressed lesbian, Lexi decides that she does not need sex with men, and immediately consummates her romance with Johanna . After finally breaking up with her cheating boyfriend, Cheryl drives to the house of her party guy Eric to plead with him for a second chance. Eric accepts Cheryl's apology and agrees to keep in touch as he leaves to go back to college. After cleaning up the last of the mess left over from the party at her house, Sue meets a friendly Hispanic guy riding by on a motorcycle outside her house who asks her for directions to a church where she frequently attends. When the guy introduces himself as Jesús, Sue sees it as a sign from God. Jesús asks Sue if she would like a ride on his motorcycle to their church and she accepts.
