Lord Krishna is revered by one and all in Gokulam. Radha's love for Krishna is born out of supreme Bhakthi. But her love was misunderstood by the villagers and her younger sister Chandravali. Chandravali feels that Krishna is responsible for her sister's lonely life and hates him. Chandragopa hates both Radha and Krishna and stays away from Gokulam with his wife Chandravali. Satyabhama is jealous of Radha and dislikes her. Rukmini alone understood both Radha and Krishna. Krishna himself with the help of Narada reveals the nature of divine love to these mortals.
