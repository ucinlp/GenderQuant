Annie Walker  is a single woman in her mid-30s, living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After her bakery, Cake Baby, failed, she lost her boyfriend and her savings and now works in a jewelry store. Although her flaky artist mother  encourages her to return home, Annie shares an apartment with British immigrant Gil  and his long-visiting sister, Brynn , who doesn't pay rent and reads Annie's journal. She has a no-strings-attached sexual relationship with the self-absorbed Ted  but hopes for something more. Annie's best friend, Lillian Donovan , becomes engaged to a wealthy banker living in Chicago and asks Annie to be her maid of honor. At the engagement party, Annie meets her fellow bridesmaids: Lillian's cynical cousin Rita ; idealistic friend Becca ; raunchy future sister-in-law Megan ; and Helen Harris III , the beautiful but over-the-top wife of Lillian's fianc√©'s boss. Helen and Annie, each jealous of the other's friendship with Lillian, take an instant dislike to each other, but Lillian persuades them to spend time together. Playing opposite each other in a game of doubles tennis, Annie and Helen deliberately hit each other with their volleys multiple times and scream at their partners if they make a mistake as they are trying to impress the other. A few days later, Annie takes Lillian and the bridesmaids to a Brazilian steak restaurant for lunch before going to a chic bridal shop. While Lillian is in the restroom, Annie suggests a Paris-themed bridal shower, but Helen disparages the idea. At the bridal shop, Helen again uses her influence to gain access because Annie did not realize that reservations were needed. Then everyone except Helen  becomes ill with food poisoning. While everyone else becomes ill, Helen orders for everyone the bridesmaid dresses she liked best thus continuing to show-off and impress. Worried about her finances, Annie suggests a bachelorette party at Lillian's parents' lake house. Helen overrules her and books a trip to Las Vegas. Out of pride, Annie refuses to allow Helen to buy her a first-class ticket and sits in coach. While Annie was in the coach she was sitting next to someone equally afraid of flying. Because Annie is afraid to fly, Helen gives her sedatives and alcohol. This makes Annie inebriated and paranoid, and her outbursts cause the plane to land in Casper, Wyoming, where she, Lillian and the bridesmaids are escorted off the plane; the bachelorette party is canceled. On the bus back to Milwaukee, Annie tries to apologize but Lillian tells Annie she wants Helen to take over planning the shower and wedding. Annie continues to hope for a relationship with Ted, but begins flirting with Officer Nathan Rhodes , a friendly traffic cop who earlier had let her off without a ticket for broken taillights. Nathan encourages her to open a new bakery, but Annie refuses; her business's failure was so painful that she has given up baking entirely. After the two of them spend the night together, Nathan buys baking supplies with which he suggests Annie make them breakfast. Offended, Annie leaves. Annie is fired from her job for calling a rude teenage customer a "little cunt" and after not being able to pay rent, Gil and Brynn tell her she has to move out. She moves in with her mother. Annie travels back to Chicago for the bridal shower at Helen's house. Helen has created an elaborate version of Annie's Parisian theme, then upstages Annie's heartfelt, handmade shower gift by giving Lillian a trip to Paris to be fitted for her wedding gown by one of the world's top designers. Enraged that Helen has taken credit for the Parisian theme, Annie throws a temper tantrum and is kicked out of the shower. Lillian tells her not to come to the wedding either. On the way home, Annie's car gets hit after she almost hits a porcupine and the driver quickly leaves. Nathan answers the emergency call and tells Annie how much she hurt him and not to contact him again. Ted comes to pick Annie up but, when he asks her to perform oral sex on him on the way home, she breaks off the relationship and walks home. Over the next several days, Annie becomes reclusive, refusing to leave her mother's house and watching television obsessively. Megan finds her and tells her to stop feeling sorry for herself by revealing to her how she overcame bullying due to her weight and became a high security government employee . Annie realizes her errors and tries to make amends with Nathan by baking him a cake. But he leaves it on his doorstep for raccoons to eat. On the day of the wedding, which Annie doesn't intend to attend, Helen appears on her doorstep, begging for help in finding Lillian, who has gone missing. Helen tearfully explains how lonely she feels and apologizes for all she has done to hurt Annie out of jealousy. They pull up alongside Nathan in his police car and, after some persuasion via intended reckless and crazy driving, he grudgingly helps Annie and Helen find Lillian, who is at her own apartment. Lillian had gone there distressed by Helen's wedding micromanagement and her fear that Annie will have no one to be with. Annie tells her everything will be fine and helps her get ready for the wedding. Annie resumes her place as maid of honor at the wedding, which Helen has arranged to include neon signs, fireworks and an appearance by Wilson Phillips. After the wedding, Helen again apologizes to Annie and hopes they can be friends in the future. Realizing that Annie and Nathan were falling in love, Helen arranged for him to pick Annie up after the wedding. They leave in his squad car, lights flashing and siren wailing. In a post-credits scene, Megan is recording a sex tape with an air marshal she met on the plane to Vegas, and she feeds him a submarine sandwich while talking dirty.
