On a rainy New York City autumn afternoon, the head of a major Department Store, Gail Allen, meets her second cousin and best friend Lorna for afternoon tea. Her cousin, an authoress of love stories set in the South Seas, invites a resident fortune teller to predict Gail's future. At first the reading sounds like a hundred others, until she foresees her having a child and meeting a man whose arm was cut by a native's rice knife. The fortune teller predicts as Neptune is in her sign at the moment she could find herself walking down a street and taking an unexpected turn where things would change. Thinking that her career will come first, Gail does not like her predicted future but finds herself taking an unexpected turn that takes her into a shop that sells sailboats. There she meets Bill Burnett who lives in Bali and is holidaying in New York. Beginning with Bill's injury from a native's rice knife, all of the predictions eventually come to pass.
