The film begins with two bedraggled peasants, Tahei and Matashichi , escaping the aftermath of a battle en route to the Hayakawa country where they lived, but later captured and forced into slavery. After an uprising in the slave compound, Tahei and Matashichi escape and settle near a river, where they find gold belonging to the Daimyo for whom they had fought. They thereafter travel with General Rokurota Makabe , escorting Princess Yuki Akizuki ([[Misa Uehara  and what remains of her family's gold to a secret territory. In order to keep her identity secret, Yuki poses as a mute. During the mission, the peasants impede it and sometimes try to seize the gold. They are later joined by a farmer’s daughter , whom they acquire from a slave-trader. Eventually, they are captured and held by Rokurota's rival; but the latter unexpectedly sides with the Princess and Rokurota. The peasants stumble upon the gold, but are later captured; whereupon Rokurota explains Yuki's true identity, and states that all of the gold has been used to restore her family's domain. The peasants are then dispatched, taking a single ryō. In the final scene, Tahei gives this to Matashichi to protect; but Matashichi allows Tahei to keep it.
