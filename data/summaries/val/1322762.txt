Porky bangs on the door, demanding to be let in, but the cats pop out of the door and proclaim in unison, "Milkman, keep those bottles quiet!", and then slam the door in his face. While the cats are lounging around, Porky throws open the window, making an incredibly menacing face. He chases them around the house until one of them throws him into a teapot.
