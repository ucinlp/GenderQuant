The movie takes place in the year 2079. 45 years earlier, Earth was attacked by a hostile alien civilization from Alpha Centauri. A totalitarian global military government is established to continue the war effort. The film follows Spencer Olham â€”a designer of top secret government weapons. He is arrested by the military, led by Major Hathaway, on the suspicion of being a replicant created by the hostile aliens. The replicants are perfect biological copies of existing humans, complete with transplanted memories... and do not know they are replicants. Each has a small, organic nuclear bomb in place of a heart, and they are programmed to detonate when they are in proximity to their target. The government intercepted an alien transmission ordering Olham's replicant to assassinate the Chancellor when he met with her weeks earlier. Olham manages to escape the prison just before Major Hathaway was to remove and examine his heart for evidence of a bomb, accidentally killing his friend Nelson in process. With the help of underground stalker Cale, Olham avoids capture and sneaks into a veteran's hospital  in order to perform a medical scan on himself to prove his innocence, but the machine malfunctions while scanning his chest. Olham and his wife are eventually recaptured by Hathaway in a forest near an alien crash site near the spot where they spent the weekend. Inside the ship they discover the corpses of the original, real Olham and Maya, who were indeed killed on their weekend picnic. At that moment Olham realizes that he really is a replicant, his self-destruct sequence engages and the nuclear bomb in his chest detonates, killing himself, Maya, Hathaway and all of his soldiers, thus destroying most of the forest as well as all evidence of the crash site. In the final scene, the news announces that Olham and Hathaway were killed in an enemy attack, and Cale wonders if he really knew Olham's true identity.
