Young Andy Stannard is kidnapped from school by a woman disguised as a nurse. His shaken parents, Dave and Edith, notify the police. Dave Stannard is a wealthy executive. Helped by his brother and business partner Al, he prepares to pay a $500,000 ransom demanded by the kidnappers. But the chief of police, Jim Backett, and a newspaper reporter, Charlie Telfer, tell him that the odds are his son won't be returned whether or not he pays the ransom. Dave decides to turn the tables on the kidnappers. He appears on television, refusing to pay and instead placing the money before him as a bounty on their heads if his son is not safely returned. Dave is vilified by his wife, brother and the public for his decision. He is left virtually alone at home, wondering until the very last minute if his gamble was worth the risk. Andy  returns to his father Dave, in the house garden in the late evening, in a new shirt making a poignant parental love scene.
