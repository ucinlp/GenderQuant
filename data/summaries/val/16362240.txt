Jyothi Lingam  is a bright student and son of a mason who leads a happy life in his village near Tirunelveli. One day tragedy strikes as his father the only earning member dies in an accident while crossing an unmanned railway gate, and young boy now has to look after his mother and two sisters. Due to circumstances, he is forced to abandon his studies, though he comes first in his school in the board exam. Through a canvassing agent, he and his friend Marimuthu, get jobs as sales boys in a textile showroom in Ranganathan Street in Chennai. Jyothi, along with hundreds of others, are employed at the Senthil Murugan Stores run by the big Annachi. In each floor at the textile showroom, there are around 50 to 60 sales boys and girls who work in pitiable conditions from early in the morning to late night, without any rest. He meets Kani , a fiery independent girl. The difficult and harrowing times in the store bring them together as they face up to a cruel and lewd store supervisor Karungali , who beats up the boys and molests the girls when they play around during duty hours. As Jyothi says there is no escape from the “Jail like” atmosphere in the shop where employees are treated more like slave labour in a concentration camp than without any human dignity. Angadi Theru is about how these two survive in a concentration camp like condition and what happens when fate perpetually smiles very cruelly at them. Sneha lights up the happenings in a small cameo as herself by doing a commercial advertisement for that Stores. This film is considered to be a milestone in Tamil cinema due its raw content. This movie is loosely based on the real happenings at the two Popular Stores in Ranganathan Street in Chennai.{{cite web}}
