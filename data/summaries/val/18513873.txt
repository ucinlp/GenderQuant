He needs to drive her to a Matha in Thirthahalli and to make the journey interesting, he tells a story, interspersed with sub-stories. The fore-said matha has asylum taking care of handicapped Orphans and rare temple of Lord Brahma. He narrates about this Mata, whose Chief is a skirt-chaser and goes to the extent of playing Flute to girls over phone, just to impress upon them. The Chief decides to part with the post, in order join his wife back. In unique circumstances, the manager and Administrator of the matha, Appayya,  advertises in NewsPaper declaring Vacancy for "Chief of Matha". In unique way of narration, Appayya declines to read out the dialogues which declares Chief of Matha is vacant and an Ad in the paper needs to be placed. Director GuruPrasad makes an entry bombarding Appayya to enact his role, as he is paid to do just that viz., read out the dialgoues. The introduction scene of the film is fabulous as all the characters are invited with vedic hymns ,"Asathoma Sadgamaya", that signifies the light in all directions. Thabla Nani as Venugopala nick name packet, Sudheendra as Chintamani, Shashidhar Bhat as Shashidhar bhat, Mandya Ramesh as Mandya Nagesh,Vyjayanth Biradara as Kosta alias sidda Jaggesh as Venkatesha take the film on their shoulders.It is a great master piece,that has every essence from crisp dialogues to a meaningful and soul scrippling script. The character;'s are neglected by the society,their quest for a societal status and food drives them to do all kinds of things to just remain in the training period as they want to avoid being foodless. The comedy scenes involving nagraj murthy as a Muslim king brings great hilarious scenes that signifies the hold on making the audience waiting for the intuitiveness of the next scene.Sudarshan has given a great modification of a cool head who always emphasize dharma, Managers role orchestrated by Sadananda is at his comical best. It is an eye opener to all the present day directors that a cinema is not a bundle of songs or locations instead it is an introspecting field where a societal message should be given to the public at large. Hero Jaggesh and 6 other people each representing kaama, krodha, lobha, mada, moha and maatsarya make it to the tentative list. Film traverses their journey towards becoming Swamiji [Chief of Matha]
