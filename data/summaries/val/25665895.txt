In the early twentieth century, after the death of her mother, the young Manuela is admitted to a boarding school for girls where the headmistress imposes a rigid discipline. Manuela projects all her affection onto Miss Elisabeth von Bernburg, only supervisor to show her any kindness. At boarding school, at a party where alcohol flows a little freely, Manuela creates a scandal by loudly proclaiming her love for Miss von Bernburg. Her later suicide attempt prompts the headmistress to review her methods while Elisabeth von Bernburg resigns.
