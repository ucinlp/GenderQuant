A followup to the musical-revue short Our Gang Follies of 1936, the one-reel Reunion in Rhythm was apparently filmed under the title Our Gang Follies of 1937. Its release title reflected the fact that, in addition to such current Gang members as Spanky, Alfalfa, Darla, Buckwheat, and Porky, the film also features return appearances by former "Our Gang" stalwarts Mickey Daniels, Mary Kornman, Joe Cobb and Mathew "Stymie" Beard. The occasion is a class reunion at Adams Street Grammar School, where the students stage a show for the entertainment of the alumni. A running gag has Buckwheat attempting to recite "Little Jack Horner" , as Spanky tries to keep him offstage. Musical highlights include "Baby Face", performed by Darla and Porky; and "Broadway Rhythm", performed by Spanky and the ensemble; and a medley of "Going Hollywood"  and "I'm Through With Love", sung by Alfalfa and Georgia Jean LaRue.
