The lives of two closely linked families dangerously intersect in a small Illinois town in the 1950s. Two brothers, Jacey and Doug Holt are growing up in Haley, Illinois, sons of a working single mother. Their father, a reckless risk-taker, has lost his life via a bet with Lloyd Abbott , his business partner. Abbott eventually becomes one of the town's foremost, wealthiest and most-admired citizens. The lives of the Holts and the Abbotts are intertwined through various entanglements. Lloyd Abbott and his distant wife, Joan, are the parents of three beautiful daughters, Alice, Eleanor and Pamela. Because of a misunderstanding of the circumstances surrounding his father's death , Jacey  seeks revenge on the Abbotts through the calculated seduction of the Abbott daughters. At first, Jacey cannot wait to escape the suffocating life in Haley; later in the film, however, he is pulled back as he idolizes the Abbott family, and obsesses about the oldest daughter, Alice , thus seeking to jockey his way into the Abbott family. At first, Doug , the younger brother, admires and worships his brother's libertine lifestyle. However, as he matures, he discovers that all that glitters is not gold. He eventually falls in love with the youngest, virginal Abbott, Pamela , who protests his early, fumbling sexual advances, and she forces him to appreciate her for who she is, not what she may offer up to him. Meanwhile, Eleanor is sent away to stewardess school after she and Jacey are caught by Lloyd Abbott, who cannot keep them apart. After two years of being apart from each other, Doug and Pamela meet again by chance while they are in college in Philadelphia and seem to rekindle their previous romance. However, Doug is later devastated by the revelation that Jacey has, prior to Doug's arrival, seduced Pamela when they previously met at a college party...a seduction he later admits was calculated to continue his revenge upon the Abbots. Jacey is apologetic when he realizes Doug's feelings for Pam. Doug strikes his brother and leaves in a rage. Later, the two brothers reconcile when Doug and Jacey are brought back to Haley after their mother's death. While sorting through his mother's belonging, Doug finds a letter from their late father proving he sold their valuable patent for a 1937 DeSoto Coupe convertible; the same one he later drove into a lake, killing him. He shares this information with his brother, but the truth does little to sooth Jacey's resentment and belief that he and his family were cheated out of their rightful place in life. Doug, however, decides to forget old resentments and move on. Despite the obstacles that Lloyd Abbott places in the way of any of the Holt brothers ever seeing his daughters again, Doug convinces Abbott at the end of the story of his true love for Pamela and receives his blessing on a future relationship.
