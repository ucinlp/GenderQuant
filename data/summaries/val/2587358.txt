Snoopy is performing guard duty for Peppermint Patty, but gets sidetracked when he meets a beautiful dog named Genevieve . Soon after, Snoopy decides to get married, and wants his brother Spike to be the "Best Beagle"  at his wedding, resulting in Spike traveling a long way from Needles, California and trying to earn money by competing in a dog race, only to be disqualified for being a beagle and not a greyhound. Snoopy is at first excited, but soon grows nervous at the prospect of marriage, acting miserable at his own bachelor party, and even breaking down into tears hours before the wedding. At the ceremony, everything is in order, until it seems the bride is late. Lucy soon arrives with news that the bride-to-be has just run off with a golden retriever. Snoopy is heartbroken at first, but soon lightens up at the prospect of remaining a bachelor, and enjoys the wedding cake with Woodstock. Spike returns home to his residence, a gigantic hollowed-out cactus with electricity and modern amenities, and the show ends by Spike enjoying part of the wedding cake by himself.
