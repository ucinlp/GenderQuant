Insurance investigator Ted Sanders is assigned to look into a robbery/murder. When he arrives at the crime scene he is met by a local deputy. What he doesn't know, however, is that the "deputy" is actually part of the gang that committed the crime. He plants some of the stolen money in Sanders' room to frame him for the crime, then arrests him.
