Just as they did in Ye Olde Minstrels, the gang prevails upon old-time minstrel impresario Uncle Wills to help them stage a fund-raising musical show. Highlights include the ensemble number "When Grandma Wore a Bustle", the barbershop-quartet set piece "Songs of Long Ago", and the grand finale "Dances Old and New". The kids are unable to post the profits because Mickey has allowed most of the audience to enter for free, but Uncle Wills comes to the rescue once again.
