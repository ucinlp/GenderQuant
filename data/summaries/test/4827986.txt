Two cops, R and Noma, hunt down renegade cyborgs. The cyborgs serve a number of duties, ranging from military commandos to "dolls", engineered for companionship. They have a limited 3 year lifespan, although black market technology has been developed to transfer a cyborg's artificial intelligence into the brain of a human host. This breakthrough compels R into finding Cyon, an orphaned prostitute, who may serve as the host for the mind of his doll Ria. He has fallen deeply in love with his doll and she has only a few days left to live. Eventually, R must make a decision between leaving the colony with Ria and spend her last days with him on a paradise-like planet or save his friends when a renegade combat cyborg takes over the police headquarters.
