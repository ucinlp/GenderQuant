Now, almost 30 years after their travel trailer vacation, Gösta and Gun are pensioners. This summer they'll go to their son Johan's wedding in Norrland. Gösta buys a recreational vehicle for their journey but Gun perhaps wants to go by aircraft, but in the end she wants to go with Gösta by the recreational vehicle. On the way, they pick up their granddaughter Magda. But may Gösta really make a good journey?
