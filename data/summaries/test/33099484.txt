Sameer  & Anand  are childhood friends. Right from their school days & even in college, they studied together. Both were ahead in studies as well as in sports. They were also the champions when it came to girl-chasing. In fact they used to bet amongst themselves as to who will bed the best girl, but it never lead to any fighting between them.
