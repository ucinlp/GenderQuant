A female CIA agent is assigned to train and lead an all-female combat squad to Colombia to stop a renegade agent who has hired himself out to a drug cartel and white slaver. Unfortunately, the agent's recruits consists of prison convicts - murderesses, sociopaths, bank robbers, etc. These women are guaranteed clean slates on their records if the mission is successfully pulled off. Their past "experience" from their criminal endeavors offers them some insight and skill, but their vast amount of their mission-specific training will require them to learn team effort, self-sacrifice, and the ability to follow orders and achieve mission objectives.
