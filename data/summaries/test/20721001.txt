Professor Strudel relates the story of how he managed to catch and stuff Woody Woodpecker. In Professor Strudel's Taxidermy Shop, there is seen a series of stuffed animals: a humming hippopotamus, a growling gorilla, a kangaroo, a half-stuffed elephant, and finally, Woody. The professor proceeds to relate how he outsmarted and captured Woody. In a forest, he hears Woody pecking away at a tree. He gets up and catches Woody, who bops the professor with a mixture of Tabasco and chili powder. With a roar, the revived professor expels the mixture, which hits a tree and reduces it to ashes. The professor then employs various ways and means to capture Woody. He finally traps Woody in a cage, and we see both of them in the taxidermy shop, with Woody on the pedestal. The professor says, "Right." Woody's still alive and pecking away, this time at the professor.
