The city-state of Rome has just expelled its Etruscan overlords and become a republic. The Etruscans declare war in an attempt to regain their territory; in the ensuing battle, they capture the courageous warrior Scaevola and threaten to torture him unless he gives them strategic information. Scaevola thrusts his right hand into a brazier and lets it burn, demonstrating that he loves Rome too much to care about physical pain. The awed Etruscans release him, but the damage to his hand prevents him from wielding a sword. The Roman Senate manages the war badly, and it becomes clear that only Scaevola can lead his countrymen to victory. He trains himself to fight with his left hand, and is soon able to return to battle and defeat the Etruscan kings.
