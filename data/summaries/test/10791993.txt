The industrialist is murdered and Sridevi also sees Ramesh in her house that same night. Ramesh is dragged to court and is shortly framed for murder. Sridevi is upset, and the ill-intentioned relatives start closing their net around her, forcing her to marry Y. G. Mahendran . In the meantime, the grief-stricken Ramesh meets another person named Raja  in jail who looks exactly like him. Together Ramesh and Raja plan to punish the culprits and set the record straight.
