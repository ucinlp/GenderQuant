The Civil War is over and Congressional Medal of Honor winner John Benedict is a Colorado rancher now, with a wife and four children. His pride and joy, son Morgan, is invited to attend West Point, but prefers to help run his father's ranch. One day while John is away, he sees Comanche Indians riding from the ranch. He returns to find his family killed, Morgan hanged inside a barn. Vowing vengeance, John ignores a posse organized by Sheriff Whitcomb and forms his own band, freeing six men from a prison. If they help him find Tarp, who apparently led the slaughter of his family, John will do everything in his power to pardon them from jail. One of the six, Chamaco, bonds with John, feels like a son to him, but is offended by John's reaction to that. He shoots John in the chest. Elizabeth Reilly nurses him back to health, saying the bullet missed his heart by an inch. The six convicts, including Chamaco, continue to follow John in his quest. The trail leads them to a U.S. Army camp, where the six help fend off an Indian attack. By the time John comes face to face with Tarp, his thirst for revenge is gone and he rides home.
