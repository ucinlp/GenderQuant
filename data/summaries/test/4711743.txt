Max Devlin  is a shady landlord of a rundown tenement in Los Angeles who is rather jaded and callous towards his fellow man. One day while chasing an errant tenant, he is run over by a bus and killed. He descends into hell  and meets the Devil's chief henchman Barney Satin  . He is told of his life of sin and the fact that he is doomed to spend eternity at a section called Level 4. However, he is given a chance to save himself by convincing three other people, a teenage nerd, a young boy and an aspiring singer to sell their souls in exchange for his. He returns to earth and begins his frantic quest with three months  to complete his mission. Barney appears frequently throughout the movie to check up on Max's progress as well as both taunt and persuade him to carry out the plans. A running joke is that nobody, except Max, can see or hear Barney. Along the way, he discovers his innate decency, the fact that he really wasn't so bad all along. He falls in love with the boy's mother and they plan to marry on the day that the deadline for Max is up. Eventually, through various methods, he obtains all three signatures on the fatal contract . However, on his wedding day, Barney appears and tells him he will take these chosen ones right now at the stroke of midnight rather than let them live natural lives. Max is horrified and enraged by this and prepares to tear up the contracts. In the film's most intense scene, Satin appears in full devil regalia and screams at Max of his terrible fate of torment in Hell if he burns the contracts. Max does so anyway, to sacrifice himself for the three souls, and suddenly realizes he is living again. His kind, unselfish act has deemed him unfit for hell. The last scene shows Max looking upward  and saying "Thank you very much".
