{{advert}} Zach Conroy and Celeste Mercier are the hottest pair on and off the ice  until Celeste is decommissioned in a practice run. Zach has to quickly find another partner for the Paris championship meet. In glides Alejandra "Alex" Delgado, a beautiful, tough-talking  hockey player with fierce moves and a fearless skating style. Zach is willing to give her a chance, but his coach, Bryan, would rather he train with Mischa Pressell, a man-eating newbie partner neither he nor her prospective partners think too highly of. However after a fight almost erupts between Bryan and Alex's brother he quits in a huff to train Zach's biggest rivals, Cindy Halgyord and Jason Bright. This leaves Zach with no coach until he talks to former figure skating champ Jackie Dorsey. She puts Zach and Alex through their paces, but the hardest trick of all is keeping them focused on practice and not on each other as they bicker and struggle with a growing attraction between them both on and off the ice. Jackie knows that they are fire and ice, and sees the chemistry between them. She also knows that if they can get it together, they'll set the skating world on fire. However at a competition an accident occurs, and Zach feels he will hurt Alex in more ways than one. They come to terms with their feelings, and they might just have a shot at championship. With the competition fierce and the stakes higher than ever, the only way Zach and Alex can win is by putting aside their feelings and pulling out a secret weapon, the deadly Pamchenko twist used by their coach's parents. However when Alex sees a photo with Zach kissing Celeste she feels hurt and leaves, but with the help of her brother and Zach they get back together right in time for their performance. Right before they are about to get their performance, Zach tells Alex that he loves her. The two give a flawless performance and Zach and Alex kiss.
