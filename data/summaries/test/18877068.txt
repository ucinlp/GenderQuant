The cartoon, set in a city zoo, begins with a tour guide showing various animal exhibits to visitors. The final stop  is the exhibit featuring the "one and only example" of the Tweety Bird species. This draws tag-along tourist Sylvester's interest. After the requisite "I tawt I taw a puddy tat" lines, Sylvester begins his latest pursuit. The attempts, all unsuccessful, are as follows: * Tweety taking refuge in the bear cage. Sylvester uses a net to try to capture the bird, but as the shifty Tweety dodges the net, the cat hits a bear. The bear grabs the net, pulls Sylvester in and expresses his displeasure. * At feeding time, Sylvester hides in the zookeeper's meat cart. Hoping to get "fed" to Tweety, he instead is thrown to a pack of Bengal tigers. * Tweety hides in a hole inside the elephant's abode. Sylvester enters in search of his prey, but the elephant immediately covers the hole to protect the bird. Sylvester uses a wind-up mouse to frighten the pachyderm, but instead of simply moving away, the elephant inadvertently jumps and lands on the cat, flattening the puddy. * Sylvester catches Tweety walking along a bridge, and chases him into a pond, which is full of alligators. While planning how to get in the pond without injury, a lion roars, scaring Sylvester. Sylvester smashes an oar over the lion's head in anger, using the requisite "Ah, shaddap!". * In a second attempt to navigate the alligator pond, Sylvester uses a rowboat ... unaware of his passenger, the lion from earlier has entered. However, the boat sinks under the lion's weight, and the alligators snap at the lion. Once the lion regains his senses, he grabs Sylvester  and, after letting the gators have another go at the cat, he kicks him into the bear's cage, where the bear mauls the puddy again. * Sylvester pole-vaulting across the alligator pond to grab Tweety, who is hiding in a tree. Instead, the jump is mistimed  and the gators enjoy dinner. In the end, a frustrated Sylvester leaves the zoo and strikes birds off his diet list ... just before a cluster of birds land on his shoulders and head as he is walking away, muttering about his awful timing for going on a diet.
