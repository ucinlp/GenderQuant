In Japan, Nakazu  is about to get married to a woman who insists on keeping up with his daily events through a cellphone. His baseball fan friends Toshida  and Uno  feel that Nakazu needs one last thrill before tying the knot as they stumble upon a brothel called the Shogun Massage Parlor after a night of playing baseball. Toshida and Uno insist on entering into the brothel with Nakazu who has never paid for sex before. The three are presented before female buttocks that are displayed through holes in a wall to give them a taste of what the brothel has to offer. Each of the three men separate into rooms with their selected ladies of the night, Nagisa , Nonoko  and Kaori . The trio of men are unaware of the brothel's mission to sexually torture customers.
