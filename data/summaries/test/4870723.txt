The episode begins with Larry the Cucumber standing on the countertop with an easel. He announces the inception of the "Society for the Promotion of the Artistic Rendering of Fruits and Vegetables" and makes Tim Hodge the president. Tim Hodge appears on Qwerty's screen where he stands by an easel before a room of children. Tim Hodge hosts the show from here, either drawing the characters himself or cutting to one of the other artists who do the sketching. Other Big Idea artists appearing are: Tom Owens, Greg Hardin, and Joe Sapulich. Throughout the episode Larry makes frequent countertop appearances and grows increasingly discouraged that they have not drawn him yet. Eventually he announces that he is leaving, but, dressed in a cowboy hat and bandanna, Tim Hodge has the idea to draw him at last in his role as Little Joe from The Ballad of Little Joe.
