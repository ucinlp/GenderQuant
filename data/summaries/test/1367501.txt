Angela de Marco  is the wife of mafia up-and-comer Frank "The Cucumber" de Marco , who gets violently dispatched by Mob boss Tony "The Tiger" Russo  when he is discovered in a compromising situation with the latter's mistress Karen . Angela wants to escape the mafia scene with her son, but is harassed by Tony who puts the moves on her at Frank's funeral. This clinch earns her the suspicion of FBI agents Mike Downey  and Ed Benitez , and also of Tony's ball-busting wife Connie , who repeatedly confronts Angela with accusations of stealing her husband. To further complicate things, Mike Downey is assigned to monitor all of Angela's movements as part of an undercover surveillance operation, but cannot resist becoming romantically involved with Angela himself. Angela's attempts to break away from the Mob result in comic mayhem and a climactic showdown in a honeymoon suite in Miami.
