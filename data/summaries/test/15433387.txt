Rajni  lives in a small village in rural India with her father, Govindram , who is a respected gentleman as well as the village Sarpanch. When Rajni comes of age, Govindram arranges her marriage with Shankar , the son of Shewaram. Shankar comes to see Rajni, and both are attracted to each other. Then the peace in the village is shattered when a notorious dacoit, Hiralal, breaks out of prison and takes shelter in Govindram's house. It is then Rajni finds out that her father is not who he claims to be; is far from respectable, and has had a dark and parallel life. The film has two famous songs "Aaj unse pehli mulaqat hogi", which Rakesh Roshan sings riding on a horse back and "Tera mera juda hona", among others.
