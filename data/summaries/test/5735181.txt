A tale of class conflict in an historical Brazilian setting, there is much more meaning  woven into the plot than is represented here. Antonio das Mortes is a legendary and brooding man with a troubled past that haunts him and keeps him in need of an enemy to fight against. Working for the landed nobility, he is sent to kill Coirana, the last canguaceiro  of a Bahia inland city. He kills Coirana, but is changed by his experiences with the poor, and so Antonio das Mortes then demands that the colonel  distribute the food stored in a warehouse to the remaining canguaceiros. The colonel raged and sent Mata Vaca  to kill Antônio das Mortes. But Antonio das Mortes with the help of his friend "Professor" kills Mata Vaca and his jagunços . The colonel is killed by a local. The movie ends with Antonio das Mortes walking by the roadside, carrying on the struggle - in some ways hopeless or unending - which extends beyond the killing of the colonel and the expropriation of his land.
