Frank Chandler had learned eastern magics from the Yogis in India and is now known as Chandu. He has the power to teleport, astral project, mesmerize, as well as project illusions. With these supernatural abilities he has been entrusted to "go forth with his youth and strength to conquer the evil that threatens mankind." Specifically, an Egyptian villain known as Roxor, played by Bela Lugosi. Roxor kidnaps Chandu's brother-in-law, Robert Regent, an inventor who has developed a death ray with a range that covers half way round the world. Chandu must use his entire bag of tricks to rescue not only his brother-in-law but his sister and their children, whom Roxor has kidnapped in order to compel Regent into revealing the secrets of the death ray. Chandu's sweetheart Egyptian Princess Nadji also gets kidnapped, leaving Chandu to ponder whom to rescue first. Using his Yogi abilities, Chandu makes daring escapes, including one from a submerged sarcophagus. Eventually he succeeds rescuing everyone and mesmerizing Roxor long enough to destroy the death ray and the villain's entire lair. {{Citation needed}}
