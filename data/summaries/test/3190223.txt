Dr. Guy Luthan  is a New York emergency room doctor who one night comes across a strange patient: a homeless man who has a wristband from a hospital he's not familiar with, mentioning a drug he's never heard of, and with strange symptoms, including a wildly fluctuating heart rate. When the man dies, Guy attempts to follow up and find out more about the patient - only to find that the body and all records have disappeared, and he's told by his superiors to drop the case. As he continues trying to find out what happened, his personal and professional life get suddenly sidetracked. His home is ransacked and cocaine is planted near his bedside. The police arrest him and he is convicted and in the process he loses his job, the ability to ever practice medicine anywhere in the world and virtually all of his friends. In desperation, he manages to get the help of some homeless men who lead him to their underground home. His ER patient who died also had lived there. Through them he's led to an organization, led by Dr. Myrick , that performs spinal experiments on the homeless people, all of whom have died thus far, in an attempt to find a cure for paralysis. Myrick attempts to sway Luthan to join his team telling him that these people are heroes and losing one to save millions is worth the sacrifice. Dr. Luthan admits that while there is some truth in what Myrick says, he states they have not chosen to be heroes, which makes Myrick a murderer. Myrick is shot and accidentally killed by rogue FBI Agent Frank Hare ([[David Morse . Later, Mrs. Myrick hands the discs and documentation regarding the research to Luthan telling him "my husband was trying to do a good thing, but in the wrong way". He opens the package, views the materials and proceeds towards the neurology building where he is now working.
