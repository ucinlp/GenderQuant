The U.S. has not yet entered World War II when kindly stamp dealer Otto Becker  is unexpectedly visited by his twin brother, Baron Hugo von Detner , the new German consul to the U.S. and one of the leaders of a spy ring engaged in sabotage. The brothers have not seen each other in years, but now von Detner wants to use Becker's shop to transmit and receive secret messages. Becker refuses, until von Detner threatens to have him deported back to Germany as an illegal immigrant and reveals that Becker's assistant, Miss Harper , is actually a German agent. Becker becomes a prisoner in his own store, watched constantly. When he gives his good friend and fellow stamp enthusiast, Professor Jim Sterling , a message to go to the police, Sterling is killed in a "traffic accident". Von Detner then appears to deal with the betrayal by his brother; the two men struggle and the Nazi is shot dead. Thinking quickly, Becker assumes von Detner's identity. Nobody detects the substitution except Fritz , an old family servant and lately von Detner's butler. However, he is faithful to Becker and keeps his secret. Meanwhile, Becker starts feeding what he learns to the police via anonymous telephone calls. Becker becomes acquainted with Kaaren De Relle . She had been a loyal German secret agent, but has become disillusioned by what she has seen and now only goes on with her duties to protect her family still in Germany. In addition, she had spurned von Detner's advances in the past. However, she finds the baron changed and for the better. Information provided by Becker foils a plot to blow up a freighter loaded with explosive chemicals in the Panama Canal. He also learns the names of German agents working in America; he mails the list, omitting De Relle's name, to the FBI. Eventually, Becker is unmasked by the Germans. When Kurt Richten , von Detner's aide at the embassy, threatens to notify the authorities that De Relle is a spy, Becker makes a deal with him. He sails for Germany in exchange for her safety.
