Ten years after shooting Kafi's Story British filmmaker Arthur Howes reentered in Sudan clandestinely to find out what had happened to the Nuba peoples of Torogi. He found Jihad faces everywhere. For example, a remarkable television program, Fields of Sacrifice, celebrates that week's casualties in the war against the Nuba and features family members thanking Allah for having taken their sons and brothers as martyrs. Much of the Nuba population was enrolled by the rebel movement Sudan People's Liberation Army during the Second Sudanese Civil War. Others have left their home places and live now in Refugee camp. Arthur Howes takes his previous documentary Kafi's Story and he shows it to some Nuba people living in one of these refugee camps in Kenya. Later on, in 2002, Nuba Conversations was presented in the United Nations headquarters in Nairobi to the parts involved in the warfare. And it is believed that it has strongly contributed to speed up the peace process http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1478456/Arthur-Howes.html.
