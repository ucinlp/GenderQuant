The story takes place at the fictional Custer University. Ray Blent is an honor student and college basketball star. June Ryder has come to the university to study home economics and to find a husband. The students and faculty are scandalized by her unashamed pursuit of Blent. She joins the cheerleader troupe and attends all the classes taken by Blent to ensure she has maximum contact with him. Everyone is aware of her designs on the sexually naive Blent except for him. She succeeds in convincing him that she has an intelligent, inquiring mind that he admires, although this is all done through deception. Blent is secretly propositioned, via a radio message, by a gambling syndicate to lose a key game with a visiting Russian team. He refuses to do this but is unable to return the money as he does not know who is behind the bribe. Rather than deliberately throw a game, he decides to deliberately fail an ethics exam, which automatically disqualifies him from playing. He is the best student in class and the only way he can fail is by copying Ryder's paper. Too late he realizes that his not playing is tantamount to ensuring his team will lose and he has given the gamblers exactly what they want. The film climaxes with the professor giving Blent an oral retest while the game is in progress. Blent passes and plays for the last few minutes, achieving a one-point victory for his school. The original play has a much more complex and interesting plot, actually bringing the racketeers on stage for several scenes, along with the FBI, which is investigating a series of similar attempts at "fixing" college sports. In that version, the Russian basketball team isn't even mentioned.
