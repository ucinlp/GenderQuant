The scenario opens with narration by character actor George Macready  about superstition and the abilities of vampires. A truck is loaded at the Port of Los Angeles, and as it climbs to a gated mansion in the California hills the cargo is revealed to be a coffin. Donna hosts a séance in hopes of contacting her recently deceased mother. At the party are several of her friends and Yorga, a mysterious Bulgarian mystic who performs the séance. Donna becomes hysterical during the proceedings, and Yorga uses hypnosis to calm her. After the party is over, Erica and her boyfriend Paul offer to drive the Count home. Experiencing car trouble outside of Yorga's mansion , the two resign themselves to spend the night in their van. Yorga watches the couple copulate, then attacks them. The following day Paul tells Michael, Donna's boyfriend, about the attack. Paul didn't see their attacker, and Erica doesn't remember the attack at all. Erica visits Dr. Hayes to have the mysterious bite wounds in her neck inspected. In contrast to exuberant personality of the night before, Erica now seems despondent and listless. Hayes notices she has lost a lot of blood. Unable to diagnose the cause, he recommends rest and a high protein diet. Paul and Michael discuss the strange changes in Erica's behavior. Unable to reach her by phone, the concerned men drive to her home. They find the place in disarray, and an hysterical Erica eating her pet kitten. She reacts erratically to their presence, first threatening them with violence and then attempting to seduce Paul before coming to her senses and breaking down. They restrain her and call Dr. Hayes, who begins an emergency blood transfusion. Erica babbles incoherently and begs Paul to kill her. Meanwhile, Yorga awakens in his manor and heads to his throne room where his vampiric brides lie on slabs, one of which is Donna's mother. He awakens two of them and watches as they have sex. Although Michael is skeptical, the three men consider the possibility of vampirism as an excuse for Erica's behavior. That night, Yorga visits Erica while Paul sleeps downstairs. Promising her immortality, he drains Erica of blood and completes her transformation before taking her back to his manor to add Erica as his third female vampire servant. Paul, upon finding Erica missing, rashly goes to Yorga's mansion to rescue her. Yorga easily kills him with help of his deformed servant, Brudah. Michael alerts Hayes that Paul has gone to the mansion, and Hayes confides that Paul's lack of preparation will probably lead to his death. Hayes considers his girlfriend's advice, citing a baby being found drained of its blood, to involve the police, but he is rejected as a deluded prankster following a recent rash of such calls. Hayes, Michael and Donna go to the mansion themselves to inquire about Paul's whereabouts and keep Yorga active until sunrise. While Hayes distracts Yorga with enthusiastic questions about Yorga's occult experiments, Brudah rebuffs Michael's attempts to explore the mansion. Michael and Hayes switch places to keep Yorga off his guard, but Yorga becomes increasingly insistent that it is late and his guests must leave. Yorga distracts Hayes, and Yorga strengthens his hypnotic control over Donna. After leaving the manor, Hayes convinces Michael that killing Yorga will not be easy: vampires have greater strength and the wisdom that comes from living much longer than a "mere mortal". He also grimly adds they might have to kill Paul and Erica too if they have become vampires. They plan to attack later that afternoon. Michael and Donna rest while Hayes studies vampire lore until he too falls asleep. Yorga awakens Donna telepathically and summons her back to the mansion. On her arrival, Brudah rapes her. Michael oversleeps due to Donna's sabotage of the alarm clock, and it's nearly evening when he calls to awaken Hayes. They stock up on stakes and makeshift crosses before heading to Yorga's mansion as night falls. They split up, and Hayes is confronted by Yorga. Both drop the pretense that Yorga is anything but a vampire, and Yorga leads Hayes into his basement where his vampire brides lie dormant. Hayes finds Erica's apparently lifeless body, and attacks Yorga with cross and stake, while yelling out for Michael . Yorga is irritated by Hayes' cross and taunts the doctor as he commands his brides to awaken. With Heyes' back to the approaching brides , they attack and drain the helpless Hayes. Yorga reunites Donna with her mother. Michael finds Paul's mutilated body while navigating the crypt. Brudah attacks him, but Michael stabs him--presumably to death. Michael finds Hayes as he lay dying. With his last breath, Hayes tells Michael where Donna is, just as the vampiric Erica and an unnamed red-headed vampire attack. Michael fends them off and is given the chance to stake Erica who oddly waits on him to do so. Despite seeing that she's no longer the Erica he knows, Michael can't bring himself to do it and proceeds upstairs. On the way to the staircase, Bruddah emerges from the living room, holding his profusely bleeding knife wound, but still intent on attacking Michael. Michael--somewhat stunned that Bruddah still lives--moves up the staircase as Bruddah reaches out for him, but Bruddah collapses--finally dying. Upstairs, Michael confronts Yorga and Donna's mother. Yorga pushes Donna's mother into Michael's stake and flees out the room. Michael follows and Yorga ambushes him outside the room. Michael rams the charging Yorga with his stake, killing him. Donna mourns her mother a second time before Michael collects her. He and Donna watch Yorga turn to dust before turning to leave. They are confronted by Erica and red-headed bride who, despite Yorga's death, still remain under the vampire curse carrying out his will. They chase the two downstairs until repealed by Michael's cross. As the two are forced back and toward a cellar, Erica glances ominously at Donna. Michel locks them in and takes Donna's hand believing it over. However as he turns to leave, Donna, having been fully transformed into a vampire, lunges at him fangs bared. He was too late to prevent Yorga from turning her. In a final line of voice-over, the narrator disputes that vampirism is just superstition before ending the film on a shot of Michael's lifeless body.
