One hundred years ago, aliens landed on a mountain near where a small, white five tailed fox lived. After being stranded on Earth for one hundred years, they are ready for a test flight to see if they can return home. The test fails as one of the aliens makes a mistake, and the other aliens tell him to leave. The runaway alien finds itself taken in by a class of students at the foot of the mountain. There, a teacher named Kang trains students who don't fit in at a regular school. To save the alien, the five tailed fox takes on the form of a human girl, and joins the school under the name of Yobi. Staying at the school, Yobi becomes friends with one of the students, a boy named Geum-ie. She grows more and more attached to humans and enjoys her time with them, until a fox hunter appears, as well as a shadow who gives Yobi a device which will allow her to become human by taking the soul from a human. Yobi becomes exposed to the hunter, which makes her leave. Of course, the fox hunter tries to hunt her down. Geum-ie tries to save her, but falls down in a lake which makes Geum-ie's soul trapped in a cage as a bird. Yobi tries to save him, but the shadow takes Geum-ie's soul. He states that his soul was taken from him long ago and that he needs one to become solid. Yobi defeats the shadow and some ghosts tell Yobi that the number of souls in the lake is always the same and a soul can never go out unless a soul replaces it. Yobi replaces her soul with Geum-ie's. Geum-ie returns to his world. He tries to call for Yobi, but to no avail. He is last seen leaving with the teacher and the other students. Some time later, Yobi's soul is released. Yobi becomes human and is most likely reincarnated to become human not too long after her soul had been exchanged. It is not known if Yobi and Geum-ie see each other or not, though many fans have their hopes.
