The film is set in 1861. John Blair  and his partner, Larry Adams  are dismayed when the arrival of telegraph ends the Pony Express. Hoping to utilize their horse-riding skills, they decide to start a stage coach transportation business. They go to Buchanan City and ask local magnate Cal Drake  if he is willing to sell them a stage coach. Instead, Drake offers them a franchise from his own stage coach line - a line out to bustling Crescent City. Upon arriving at Crescent City, Blair and Adams quickly realize that had been bamboozled into paying the line as Crescent City is a ghost town. The only residents are the mayor, Rocky O'Brien , and Dr. William Forsythe . The mayor is thrilled to get not only new residents to double the size of the town, but a stage coach line too. Blair disparages as there are no customers to transport and will have to lose his business so quickly. The mayor says there is a way for Blair to get all the money he owes and more. There will be a contest in the next few days where the fastest team in a race will win a $25,000 government contract to deliver mail to the area. With Blair's luck returning, he also meets a telegraph crew, who he saves from poisoning after drinking from a local water hole. In appreciation, the telegraph crew offers to run the line through Crescent City if Blair will give them laborers to build the telegraph line. Blair is able to get laborers to build the telegraph line and the population of Crescent City begins to skyrocket. Drake, upset that Blair is actually a competing business out of his lie, then decides to hire Blair to drive a gold shipment to Sacramento only to ambush him. If Blair can get the gold to the destination, Drake will take off $1,000 off of the original loan. Blair escapes the ambush and collects the money at gunpoint. Drake nexts hopes to stop Blair at the race. He gets his henchman to throw obstacles in Blair's way and hoping to defeat him by any means necessary. But despite all odds, Blair wins the race and the $25,000 reward.
