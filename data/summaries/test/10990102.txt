Drifter William Bonney , known as 'Billy the Kid' loses his horse and is befriended by cattle boss Tunstall, known as 'The Englishman', who is soon murdered by corrupt rival cattlemen led by the local sheriff. Bonney's plan for revenge, hunting down and killing all responsible via provoking gunfights endangers not only his surviving friends, but the territorial amnesty proclaimed by New Mexico governor Lew Wallace, causing his former friend Pat Garrett to finally become a sheriff and hunt him down. Meanwhile groupie Moultrie sends material fictionalizing and lionizing him back East, where it is turned into dime novels that make Billy the Kid a legend, causing Billy to confront Moultrie and throw his kit of materials in his face in rejection, ending in Moultrie betraying him to Garrett to eliminate the embarrassing real-life character so that his fictionalized version won't be disturbed. This leads to the finale where Garrett kills the exhausted discouraged Bonney after he faces him with an empty holster in an apparent attempt at "suicide by cop".{{cite book}}
