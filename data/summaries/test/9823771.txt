He informs them about Tommy O’Shea. Hoyle says they have been trying to nab Tommy for years, and he wants Olivia to testify. That night at a restaurant, Paul proposes to Olivia, who accepts. Olivia excuses herself to go to the ladies room and is attacked by Tommy’s associate, Freddie "Flakes" , who in an attempt to prevent her testimony bashes her head on a mirror, causing permanent disfigurement to her face. Freddie escapes, although Paul gets a look at him. At the hospital, where Paul is told Olivia will need reconstructive surgery, he talks with Lt. Mickey King , who has been working on the O’Shea case for 16 years. Paul is angry but is warned by King not to pick up his old habits and to let the police handle it. Tommy escalates the violence, killing several people including female police officer Janice Omori . Paul and Olivia are attacked by Freddie, who ends up shooting Olivia in the back  as the couple tries to escape. She becomes the fourth of Paul's five love interests in the series to be murdered by gang members. Tommy is "cleared" of involvement in his ex-wife’s death and seeks custody of their daughter. This sets the stage for a fight between Paul and Tommy, one that leaves Paul unconscious. He decides to return to his vigilante ways and is later assisted by Hoyle, who learns his department has been corrupted by Tommy. Tommy hires three thugs, Frankie , Mickey , and Angel , to take care of Paul, using Chelsea as bait. Paul rescues her. Lt. King is wounded by Tommy. Tommy tries to persuade Paul to spare him by saying "Anything you want, anything you need, it's yours." Paul quickly responds with "I don't need anything, but you could use a bath." Paul then finally manages to kill Tommy by knocking him into the pool of acid. He rejoins Chelsea, calling out to the injured King, "Hey Lieutenant, if you need any help, give me a call" while Paul walks toward the 'lightened' hallway.
