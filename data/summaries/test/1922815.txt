The Baker family begins to undergo many changes, beginning with Lorraine  and her desire to study in New York. Their oldest daughter Nora  is now married to Bud McNulty ([[Jonathan Bennett  and heavily pregnant, but the couple intend to move to Houston because of Bud's new job promotion. Feeling that the family is breaking apart as the children grow up and move away, Tom  persuades the entire family to take one last family vacation all together at Lake Winnetka. Tom's old rival Jimmy Murtaugh  and his large family  are also there for the summer. Jimmy constantly flaunts his wealth and success to Tom, as well of the accomplishments of his children, often suggesting to Tom that the Baker children are less successful because of Tom's parenting style. The Baker kids get into many accidents, many of which are accidental. Some examples are short scenes, such as the scene where Mark Baker , along with Kenny Murtaugh, crash into a tennis court with a golf cart and ruin the court, Sarah Baker  stealing merchandise from a gift shop, and Mark Baker accidentally setting a backpack of fireworks on fire, causing widespread panic, especially when the backpack of fireworks is thrown into a boat, igniting the boat's engine and causing it to explode. Jimmy again starts the topic that Tom needs to use a firmer hand on his kids. Tom is angered by this and they decide to settle the matter using the Annual Family Cup. Tom trains the kids for days, not realizing that they are miserable. Soon Sarah and Elliot Murtaugh  go on a date at a Movie theater watching Ice Age, where they are spied on by their fathers, leading an argument between the two and humiliating their children. Sarah is furious and refuses to compete for her father in the "stupid cup!" while Elliott rebels against his father and continues to spend time with Sarah. Everyone, including Kate, is angry with Tom; for not only spying on Sarah, but for also ruining the entire trip by his competitiveness with the Murtaugh family. Tom goes to the Annual Family Games to compete for the cup with Nigel and Kyle . Kate and the rest of the family soon show up, showing that they forgive Tom and are willing to compete for the cup. Unfortunately, the Murtaughs and the Bakers are both tied. In order to choose who win and who is 2nd place, every member from each family must work together and compete against the opposing family in a canoe race. During the canoe race, Nora's water breaks. So the Bakers and the Murtaughs work together to get Nora to the hospital as she goes into labor. While Bud, Lorraine and Kate go with Nora in the emergency room, Tom, Jimmy and the rest of the kids wait in the waiting room. While talking to Jimmy, Tom realizes that he has to let his kids grow, but wherever they go, they will always be with him; and he will always be with them. Then Bud tells Tom that he now owns the "The Big House."  Nora then gives birth to a baby boy whom they name Tom in honor of her father, who has shown them "there is no way to be a perfect parent, but a million ways to be a really good one." The movie ends with the Murtaughs and the Bakers having a barbecue at their cottage. While Tom and Kate are dancing on the end of the boardwalk, it breaks loose from the dock and begins to float away, but the two ignore it and continue dancing while the credits roll.
