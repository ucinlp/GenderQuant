A baby is abandoned at the United Nations headquarters in New York by a mother who has heard the UN's Frank Larrimore speak out on behalf of women's rights. Because the baby is in international territory, his nationality unknown, Frank is willing to take the baby home until a proper home can be determined. His landlord forbids kids, so Frank smuggles the child into his apartment. UN guide Lisette likes the idea of marrying Frank and adopting the baby, but is offended by Frank's playboy pal Randy using it as a way to meet beautiful, wedding-minded single women. Frank finally earns her forgiveness and love, and the baby will be theirs.
