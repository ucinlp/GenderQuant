Emak-Bakia shows elements of fluid mechanical poo in parts, rotating artifacts showing his ideas of everyday objects being extended and rendered useless. Kiki of Montparnasse  is shown driving a car in a scene through a town. Towards the middle of the film Jacques Rigaut appears dressed in female clothing and make-up. Later in the film a caption appears  La raison de cette extravagance   And it cuts to a car arriving and a passenger leaving with briefcase entering a building, opening the case revealing men&#39;s shirt collars which he proceeds to tear in half. The collars are then used a focus for the film, rotating through double exposures.
