The film focuses on the prom-obsessed residents of Racine and, in particular, two very different girls and one boy  who are followed in the days and nights leading up to their prom night. The "mega prom" was introduced to Racine almost 50 years ago by the city's Rotary Club after an alcohol-related car accident. As a result, the Rotary decided to sponsor a post-prom party for the city's high schools as a safe alternative for prom-goers. In the film, the city of Racine is portrayed as a racially mixed population with a similar socio-economic status. The film paints an honest, humorous portrait of this post-industrial Midwestern town and the long and rich history of its one-of-a-kind prom. Some of the students are going to college after graduation; others are headed to the military. We are given an inside look at everything from the students' selection of gowns to dinner. The celebration begins with a rowdy parade where students are shown riding fire engines, 18-wheelers, and even elephants through the city streets. Prom-goers from seven city high schools converge on one city-wide prom to make red carpet entrances. As the credits roll, we are given an update almost five years later about some of the people featured in the film. Several have not achieved their high school goals. Others have lost contact with their high school sweethearts. One heartfelt scene shows a couple going off to war.
