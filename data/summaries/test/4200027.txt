It has been years since Wayne Szalinski  blew up his son, Adam, to gigantic size. Nick Szalinski, like his sister Amy, is now living away from home to college and Wayne is the president of Szalinski Labs, with his brother Gordon Szalinski  as head of research and development. Adam , now ten years old, is having trouble making his father understand that he wants to go to baseball camp, instead of science camp, like he wants him to. Diane Szalinski  is having a hard time adjusting to Wayne's attempts to create new machines and raising her son. She and her sister-in-law, Patti , are heading out of town for the weekend while Wayne and Gordon watch their kids. While she is out of town, Diane demands that Wayne get rid of the seven-foot-tall Tiki Man sculpture that is in their hallway. He agrees, but has a better plan in mind. He decides to secretly shrink it to carry with him always instead of throwing it away, even though he was prohibited from ever using the machine again. While the kids are away buying groceries, he and Gordon bring it up to the attic where his famed shrinking machine resides. The shrinking machine has been upgraded and streamlined over the years , and now sports a large red button to fire it. While searching for the now-shrunken Tiki Man, Wayne and Gordon are accidentally shrunk to 3/4 of an inch tall when a croquet ball accidentally rolls from a shelf and lands on the button. After forgetting to give Gordon and Patti's son, Mitch , who has a potassium deficiency, his medicine, the women decide to drive back. When they return, they hear a sound in the attic, and go up to investigate. After going in, however, the same result that befell Wayne and Gorden happens as the shrink ray starts up again and another croquet ball activates it, shrinking Diane and Patti. Adam and his cousins, Mitch and Jenny , come home to find that their parents are not there. After hearing an old message on the answering machine, they believe that their fathers are at the space shuttle launch. Diane is infuriated with Wayne's antics and they decide that they need to get their children's attention. After climbing a wicker chair, they decide to ride a fishing pole thread down from the attic window and into Adam's room. Jenny decides to throw a party with her friends in the living room, which infuriates the adults. The shrunken adults reach Adam's room, ride on his Sharkruiser car on a Hot Wheels track, and accidentally fall into the laundry chute, landing in a basket of laundry. The group then stumbles upon a cockroach, from which Wayne saves Diane. Jenny's friends begin to arrive, including Jill , whose heart Adam is interested in winning. While walking around, Wayne and his family watch as Mitch begins to stumble without his medicine. The group plans to split up with Wayne and Gordon planning on rewiring the speakers to make their voice loud, while Diane and Patti look in the kitchen for Mitch's medicine. The group uses Jenny's friend's bubble machine to float down to the first floor. While the women land safely, the Men's bubble flies out of control, causing it to pop on the chandelier and they land a bowl of onion dip. They then proceed to nearly get eaten by the party girls, but, thanks to sloppy eater Jill, they fall out of the bowl and are safe. Diane and Patti stumble upon a daddy long-legs caught in a spider's web. As Patti clears the web with a nail file, Diane talks to the daddy long-legs, and realizes that being his size is bad enough without her trying to kill him when she is normal size. In the meantime, Ricky King, Jenny's crush, comes over to the house with his friends uninvited and begin to liven things up at the party, as Wayne and Gordon try to hot-wire the speakers. Ricky steals an unwanted kiss from Jenny in the kitchen, which Diane and Patti witness. Jenny, angry at Ricky, discourages him for doing so, stating that he could've asked if she wanted to kiss him in the first place. Ricky then claims that lots of girls like the way he kisses, but Jenny retorts at this, stating that she's doesn't believe that way. She then declares then party over, which gives Patti a new judgment on her. Adam finds Mitch very ill and goes into the kitchen to look for his pills, which Diane and Patti could not push into view. Mitch sees the mothers and faints  and needs potassium in his system to stay awake. Adam, after remembering that he found out bananas have potassium from his dad, saves Mitch by getting Jenny to feed him some. However, Ricky and his friends begin to cause havoc at the party as revenge for Jenny's discouragement, scaring Jenny's friends around. Still declaring the party over, Jenny demands Ricky and his friends to leave at once, but they refused, saying that they'll leave when they want to. Adam then tries to back up Jenny, which then prompted Ricky to bully Adam and mock Wayne's inventions. Fortunately, Wayne finally succeeds in hot-wiring the speakers, and Gordon pretends to be God, scaring Ricky and his friends, as well as Jenny's friends, to leave the house at once. Following the departure of the guests, Gordon reveals that the adults have been shrunk and that Diane and Patti are in the kitchen, which worries Jenny. The kids find all of their parents and place them in front of the shrink ray, having set it via Wayne's instructions to change them back to normal size. After contemplating what life would be like if they leave their parents shrunk, they chose to give them a second chance and hit the button together. After reuniting, Wayne announces he understands Adam's interest in baseball over science, and Diane tells Wayne that she is not going to sweat the small stuff anymore and that he can do whatever he likes with the Tiki Man. Patti begins to trust Jenny, and finally, Wayne decides to step down from the position of President of Szalinski Labs and get back to his true passion as a hands-on inventor, giving Gordon, who likes organizing things and is good with people, the job of President. The film's last shot reveals that Wayne has blown up the Tiki Man to tremendous size to loom over the house from the backyard.
