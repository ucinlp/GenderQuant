To those on the outside, Kate Stark  leads an idyllic life; a successful husband , an adoring young daughter , and a beautiful home. But beneath the surface, her life is less than ideal; a husband preoccupied with his career, a domineering mother , and a dark secret that not even her closest friends know: Kate is bulimic. As the pressures in her life begin to mount, Kate obsessively diets and exercises, and habitually binges and purges while adroitly hiding her eating disorder from those closest to her. When Kate's bulimia finally leads to a frightening accident that makes it clear to everyone that her illness is not only dangerous to herself, but to those around her, she's committed to rehabilitation where she must learn to face the inner turmoil at the root of her disorder before it's too late.
