Valley of the Stereos involves an escalating battle between a hippie  and a metalhead  who live next door to each other in the countryside. Following the metalhead's late-night music playing, the two battle over who can drive the other away with their incompatible music tastes. Each accumulates a larger and larger pile of stereos, until eventually River converts his house into a multi-stereo mecha and  blasts both homes out of existence.
