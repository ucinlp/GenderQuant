A detective mystery in which a lord sets out to prove that a man did not kill his wife's blackmailer. This was the first film outing for novelist Dorothy L. Sayers' fictional amateur sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey. The Silent Passenger was an original story written by Sayers specifically for the screen but unfortunately her amateur sleuth turn out as a somewhat eccentric imbecile who solved murders in spite of himself. A blackmailer is murdered by the husband of one of his victims, a railroad detective Henry Camberley , but it is the innocent John Ryder  who is suspected of the murder when Camberley puts the dead body into his trunk. After making the casual acquaintance of Ryder, amateur detective, Lord Peter Wimsey  sets about proving his friend's innocence. All these events take place while on a train trip from London to the English Channel, with Ryder acting as "bait" to flush out the real killer and solve the murder.
