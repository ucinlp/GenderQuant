In the center of a monotonous-like subdivision, Sarah and Patrick have been living with their emotions kept isolated between themselves and their son. Patrick seems to be cold and harsh by ignoring Sarah's existence, and the affection Patrick once had for her has all but disappeared. It comes to the point that his sexual urges are manifested in his actions toward his son, Joey. Sarah is left in bewilderment when she hears the discussion of his husband and son at nighttime; she even asks herself, "What have I done?" When Sarah has run out of options for trying to bring back the spark in their marriage, she tries to do the unthinkable.
