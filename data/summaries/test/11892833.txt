Petty thieves and con-men, Ajay  and Dev , accidentally kill a young man named Mohan Tripathi . This weighs heavily on their minds, so they find out the address of the deceased and travel to his village. They meet his dad, Dinanath , his mom, Sulakshana , a sister, and Mohan's wife, but are unable to tell them the sad news. So they lie and tell the Tripathis that Mohan is alive, and they are his friends. The two decide to stick around longer so that they can assist the Tripathis. They come to know that this village is being terrorized by Bhanu Pratap Singhania  and his men, who wants this land at any cost, so he can start building on it. They oppose Bhanu and his men, and for a while there is a status quo. Then Bhanu finds out that Ajay has vices &mdash; drinking and gambling &mdash; and he decides to exploit this to separate the two friends, create bitterness and anger between them, and take advantage of the situation. Ajay succumbs to his temptation to gamble and starts losing money. Shortly thereafter he has lost all his money. Humiliated, he steals some gold bangles belonging to the Tripathis and sells them, so he can continue playing. Dev finds out about this theft, and thus begins the rift between the two friends that Bhanu has been waiting for.
