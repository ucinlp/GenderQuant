The screen pans on the silhouette of a mighty Viking  arousing ferocious lightning storms, but then zooms in to reveal that it is only Elmer Fudd . Elmer sings his signature line "Be vewy qwiet, I'm hunting wabbits" , before arriving at Bugs Bunny's hole. We watch as Elmer jams his spear into Bugs's hole to "Kill the wabbit! Kill the wabbit! Kill the wabbit!" Bugs sticks his head out of another rabbit hole, and, apparently appalled, sings his signature line "What's up, doc?" to the theme of Siegfried's horn call from the Ring Cycle. He then taunts Elmer about his "spear and magic helmet". This prompts a display of Elmer-as-Siegfried's "mighty powers", set to the overture of The Flying Dutchman. At that, Bugs flees and the chase begins. Suddenly, Elmer is stopped in his tracks at the sight of the beautiful Valkyrie Br체nnhilde , riding in grandly on an enormously fat horse . "Siegfried" and "Br체nnhilde" exchange endearments, set to the "Pilgrims' Chorus" theme from Tannh채user as orchestrated in the opera's overture. After the usual "hard to get" pursuit they perform a short ballet , capping it off with the duet "Return My Love" set to another section of the Tannh채user overture. Bugs' true identity is suddenly exposed when his headdress falls off, enraging Elmer and prompting him to command fierce lightning, "typhoons, hurricanes, earthquakes" and, finally, "SMOG!!!" (a word Elmer screams which was not done by Bryan, but by BlancWhat's Opera, Doc? at the Internet Movie Database. Although Arthur Q. Bryan was the voice of Elmer at the time and performed the character for all but a single one-word line of the cartoon, Mel Blanc voiced the character for one word "SMOG!!!" because Blanc could scream the line better than Bryan. Blanc did not take over as the voice of Elmer until 1972; in the interim, [[Hal Smith  to "stwike da wabbit!" while music from The Valkyries plays in the background.  Eventually, the ensuing storm tears apart the mountains where Bugs has fled. Elmer triumphantly rushes to see his victory, but upon seeing the bunny's seemingly lifeless body, which is strangely intact, Elmer immediately regrets his wrath and tearfully carries the bunny off, presumably to Valhalla in keeping with the Wagnerian theme, per Act III of The Valkyries . Bugs suddenly raises his head to face the audience and remarks, "Well, what did you expect in an opera? A happy ending?", ironically undoing the intended sad conclusion. The Merrie Melodies end title card then appears with all the words already there. This cartoon marks one of only three times that Bugs Bunny is defeated by Fudd. The other two are Rabbit Rampage and Hare Brush. That is also the only one of the three where Fudd shows regret for defeating Bugs.
