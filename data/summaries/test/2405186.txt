This dream-like film noir is about Chuck Scott , a World War II vet now a penniless drifter tormented by bizarre dreams, who takes a job as driver to Eddie Roman , a vicious gangster. Roman tests his new driver, Scott, by assuming control of his car from the back seat. Unbeknownst to Scott, Roman has an accelerator installed in the rear passenger compartment so that he can "take over" the vehicle whenever he wants. This bizarre trick not only unnerves his new driver but also Roman's right-hand man, Gino . Scott passes the test and gets the job. But things get tough for Scott when he falls in love with the gangster's wife, Lorna , who has attempted to kill herself because life has become unbearable with her sadistic husband. The two run off together to Cuba and a bizarre chase begins wherein Scott is framed for a murder and must therefore avoid both Roman and the police. Finally, at a point when Scott is able to clear his name, he is thrown back into the nightmare in a surprising twist.
