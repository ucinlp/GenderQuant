It is a busy day at Muscle Beach; Jerry sunbathes while several cats are working out with weights. Tom and his girlfriend arrive and Tom dumps their beach equipment on top of Jerry. Jerry crawls out from the pile and moves his beach towel further down the beach, but Tom happens to pick where Jerry is lying to plant his beach umbrella. When Jerry digs himself from out of the sand, ripping his beach towel in the process before lying back down, Tom has started carelessly throwing garbage his way. Jerry angrily marches up to Tom and slaps him with a banana peel and is rewarded with being filled up with helium from a balloon and let go to rocket into the distance.  Tom turns back to his girlfriend, but she is now paying attention to Butch, who is impressing her with awesome displays of weightlifting. Tom confronts Butch, but Butch brushes him off. Tom tries to confront Butch again, but Jerry interferes, leaving Tom relatively crabby.  Still determined to win his girl back, Tom engages Butch in games of one-upmanship which ultimately prove futile. In a last-ditch effort, Tom stuffs his bathing suit with helium balloons to make it look like he is heavily muscled. The balloons make Tom float over the ground, so he ties an anchor around his waist to hold himself down. Tom returns to where Butch is showing off for his girlfriend and vanquishes his rival with a well-place swing of the anchor. Tom flexes his "muscles" for his girl but is annoyed by the sound of Jerry eating noisily nearby. Tom flips the picnic basket's cover and, by crashing on his head, it's force silences Jerry, who exacts his revenge by untying the anchor of Tom's waist. Tom has to hold onto his beach umbrella to keep from floating away, so Jerry inflates Tom's suit like a balloon with a helium canister, and then pricks him with a safety pin, causing Tom to spin in the air and float away high into the sky. Jerry attempts to impress Tom's girlfriend by lifting a barbell made with two tomatoes, but the weight is too much for him and, like Tom in his earlier attempt to impress his girlfriend, Jerry ends up flattened between the weights.
