Nandini and Navin are about to get married when disaster strikes. Navin and his friends, a hugely overweight Sudeep and Yash, go out to celebrate. An accident occurs on the highway and Navin is dead. Navin wakes up in heaven and discovers to his horror that it was a clerical error that had landed him in heaven. The man actually destined to be there was fat Sudeep with his cholesterol on overdrive! Navin makes a scene in the overcrowded waiting room of heaven and demands that he be returned to earth, and to his loved ones. This film is about how Navin returns to earth and has to woo Nandini all over again in another guise.
