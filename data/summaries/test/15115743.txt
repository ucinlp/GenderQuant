Poland, right after fall of communism, early 90s. Former agents of SB  are undergoing re-evaluation, by which new democratic Police directorship is trying to decide whether or not they are able to be incorporated into new Police. Franz Mauer  is one of them. He has a notorious service record, is ruthless, but devoted to service - the only thing he cares about, since he became estranged from his wife and son. Eventually he is recruited to Police. But one of his best friends, Olgierd, isn't. Facing unemployment, Olgierd joins a newly created crime group  which operates in drug smuggling business. Soon, Franz and Olgierd - who try to cooperate in spite of new circumstances - find each other enemies. Besides, Franz's relationship with Angela - a young girl whom Franz befriended, becomes more and more complicated as the story continues, especially after Angela meets Olgierd. {{Empty section}}
