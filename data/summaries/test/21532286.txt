Joytsna  was a girl from this community. One day a poisonous snake gave a bite at the foot of local prince . A bede was called to cure the prince. He saw and told that it is possible only by Jyotsna. Only she can suck the poison from his blood.King called Jyotsna and requested her to do so in exchage he is agree to give her everything she wants. Jyotsna cured the prince and herself became faint. After a long prayer to god by her mother and the queen she got sense and demanded the hand of the prince but the king protested. When prince came to know everything he also fell in love with Jyotsna. Then after a long tug of war they insisted the king to agree and got married. This story was taken from a very old rural Bengali play of the same name.
