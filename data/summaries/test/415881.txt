Back in France, master sergeant Galoup  remembers the time in the desert, where he led his men under the command of Bruno Forestier . His life had routine duties, such as supervising the physical exercise of his men. One day, his troop is joined by Gilles Sentain , whose physical beauty, social skills, and fortitude make Galoup envious. Repressed homosexual feelings of Galoup are suggested. When Sentain helps another soldier, violating previous orders by Galoup, the sergeant sees a chance to destroy him. As a punishment, he drives Sentain out into the desert to make him walk back to the base. But Sentain does not return because Galoup has tampered with his compass, and the soldier is lost without it. Even though Sentain is later found and rescued by a group of Djiboutis, Galoup is sent back to France by his commander for a court martial. It ends his career in the Foreign Legion. The final scene, a metaphoric dance, suggests his suicide.
