Baby is the tragic story of an Asian-American youth trapped in the seedy, dead-end world of hostess bars, pool halls and drug dens that characterize East Los Angeles gang life in the 1980s. Baby  is a motherless, poverty stricken 11-year-old with only an alcoholic father  to raise him. Things only get worse when he's taken under the wing of his gangster neighbor Tommy , who leads him down a path that lands him in Juvenile Hall for manslaughter, with Benny  ostracizing Baby from the group. After seven violent years in prison, Baby  is released, but struggles to fit into a society that rejects him, and soon returns to a life of drugs, street gangs and murder, while Benny has risen through the ranks to become the local Crime Boss. Only his childhood friends and a lost love offer him any hope of turning his life around before it's too late.
