It was winter time and Krazy is in his horse-drawn sleigh, running through the snowy outdoors. Next, he stops over at the house of his spaniel girlfriend. Krazy then calls and invites her to go out with him. Showing herself through a window, the spaniel discloses she could not come outside because her door was blocked by thick snow. In this, Krazy and his horse went on to clear the doorway. In just a short while, the impeding snow was removed, and the spaniel finally steps out. They then head off in the sleigh. Krazy and the spaniel arrived at their destination, the frozen lake. They then put on their ice skates and set foot on the ice. For several moments, things were going very smooth for them. Their movements were fluent and they never stumble into things. This was until Krazy crashes into a wooden barrel and starts to lose control. He then overshoots the edge of the lake and gets himself into a snowy slope. As he tumbles down the slope, Krazy becomes covered in snow and immediately becomes a large rampaging snowball. The snowball bashes a cabin and rolls into a barn where it runs over the farm animals. Finally, it spatters onto a larger house, and Krazy was free at last. Just nearby him was the spaniel who was relieved to know he is unharmed. Without further ado, they continued looking for ways to spend time in the frosty landscape.
