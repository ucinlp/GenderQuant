{{Main}} {{See}} The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa is the second greatest volcanic eruption in recorded history , erupting more than 18 cubic kilometres of tephra in less than 48 hours, and killing about 36,500 people. A subplot concerning Rogier Verbeek , a Dutch geologist who had surveyed the area two years earlier and laid the basis for modern vulcanology with his research after the eruption, adds a scientific touch and a helpful map to the computer-generated imagery that convincingly portrays the ash cloud, collapse of the mountain, pyroclastic flows, and tsunamis. The film also portrays a family trying to escape the devastating volcano and a ship with more than 100 passengers trapped at sea when the eruption reaches its height.
