After an incident where he used questionable police tactics, Jeff Powers is placed on probation. Upon hearing of his probation, a friend from the force later invites Jeff to join the Special Investigation Section, an elite and highly secretive LAPD unit designed to track and shut down high profile criminals. Jeff discovers that the group in actuality functions more like an unofficially sanctioned death squad of rogue cops who are given wide latitude when it comes to dealing with criminals. Although their stated mission is to surveil criminals and arrest them while in the act of committing a crime, the squad will often resort to using brutality and murder to accomplish their goals. This causes Jeff to question the purpose of the squad, and he begins to see them as being more of a harm to society then a positive force for justice. When he tries to bring evidence of the squad's abuse of power, he learns that the squad is protected by well-connected and very influential people who already know and condone the squad's methods. Jeff's former teammates in the squad begin to suspect that Jeff has turned on them and decide to take measures to eliminate him before he can expose their activities to the public.
