Bimbo sneaks into the theater stage show. In a vaudeville act the crowd cheer Betty by name when she comes on stage. Betty Boop, with dog's ears, a white nose, lots of curls and an enormous head, performs a song called "You're Driving Me Crazy". During Betty's performance her dress falls off, revealing a frilly bra. Bimbo runs afoul of a stage hypnotist.
