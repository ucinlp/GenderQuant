{{plot}} Julia Lofting , her husband Magnus , and daughter Kate  sit down to breakfast and Kate starts to choke on an apple. When the apple refuses to dislodge, Julia frantically reaches for a knife and tries to perform a tracheotomy. Kate bleeds to death. Julia subsequently leaves her husband and moves to a new house. A room upstairs has a child's possessions in it. As she unpacks, she finds her dead daughter's clown doll with sharp, clanking cymbals and accidentally cuts her finger on them. In a nearby park, Julia thinks she sees Kate, but the girl disappears. She hears strange noises in her house, blaming them on Magnus, who she believes is spying on her. The child's possessions in the room cannot be photographed. A radiator in the house mysteriously turns on by itself. Later, Julia sees the girl in the park again, but finds a mutilated turtle and a knife where she stood. Her sister-in-law Lily asks if her friends can use her house to conduct a seance. The medium, Mrs. Fludd, explains that spirits need to control someone to carry out physical acts. During the seance, she tells Julia to leave the house immediately. Moments later, one of Lily's friends, Miss Pinner, falls down the stairs. While Juila is out, Magnus breaks into her house to find her. The heater is on full blast. He sees something out of the corner of his eye and follows it to the basement, but is killed after falling from the staircase. A neighbor tells Julia the house once belonged to Heather Rudge, who moved away after her daughter choked to death. Julia visits Mrs. Fludd, who has taken ill since the seance. She tells the medium she is convinced her house is possessed by Kate's spirit, but the medium tells her she saw a little boy in the park, bleeding to death. When Julia finds an article about a boy, Geoffery Braden, murdered in the park, she visits Greta, Geoffrey's mother. She tells her a vagrant was executed for the crime, but that children murdered her son. She says she and her companion have been watching the children, now grown, and asks her to visit the remaining two, Captain Paul Winter and David Swift. Winter dismisses her after she says she's been to see Mrs. Braden. Outside she sees Miss Pinner, who denies seeing anything frightening in the house. Julia next visits Swift, an alcoholic, who admits that Olivia had power over him and the other children. She made them each kill an animal, then made them murder Geoffrey. He says he told only Heather Rudge. That night, as she sleeps, a child's hand caresses Julia's face and holds her hand. She awakes and breaks some glass. At that moment Swift, walking down the stairs, slips on a broken bottle and falls over the railing, dying. Julia tells her friend, Mark  what she has discovered, but he doesn't believe her. That evening, her heater won't turn off. She tries to unplug it and shocks herself as Mark is killed by electrocution when a lamp falls into his bath. Julia visits Mrs. Rudge in a psychiatric home. She says she killed Olivia after she learned about the murder, and that Olivia's spirit killed Katie. As Julia leaves, Mrs. Rudge dies of a heart attack. At home, Julia sees Olivia in the bathroom mirror, then in the living room on the floor playing with the clown toy. She takes it from her, offers her a hug and asks her to stay with her. The scene fades and we hear the toy fall. Julia comes back into view, bleeding to death from cuts on her neck, seemingly made by the sharp cymbals.
