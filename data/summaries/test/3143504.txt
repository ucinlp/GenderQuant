Vartan Malt  is the editor of a tabloid called the National Mirror that specializes in unlikely stories about celebrities and frankly unbelievable tales about ordinary folkspersons. When Malt gets word that a woman is supposedly harboring an angel in a small town in Iowa, he figures that this might be up the Mirror's alley, so he sends out three people to get the story â€“ Frank Quinlan , a reporter whose career has hit the skids; Huey Driscoll , a photographer on the verge of losing his job ; and Dorothy Winters , a self-styled "angel expert" . They arrive at the roaming house of Pansy Milbank , who informs them that she does indeed have an angel for a tenant and introduces them to Michael . Michael has wings like an angel, but the resemblance ends there. Michael loves cigarettes, sugar, has an uncontrollable belly laugh, tends to use a large number of non-angelic phrases, does not care much for personal hygiene, and smells like cookies. Michael informs his visitors that an angel is allowed to take a certain number of "vacations" on Earth and that he is in the midst of one now. That said, this is the last vacation he is allowed, and he has decided to make the most of it. After Pansy unexpectedly dies, Frank and Huey stumble upon a great story idea-- if Michael wants to have some fun, why not take him to Chicago, where he can really kick up his heels? Michael reveals that this was his plan from the beginning. The rest of the film deals with the experiences that Frank, Huey, Dorothy, Sparky, and Michael have while driving to Chicago . During the trip it is slowly revealed that Michael's mission on Earth is to get Frank and Dorothy together despite both having had bad experiences with love. After Sparky is hit by a truck and killed, Michael brings him back to life. In the process he uses up his allotment of miracles and begins to weaken. The group reaches Chicago just in time for Michael to see the Sears Tower  before disappearing. After Frank and Dorothy go their separate ways, Michael returns one more time  and successfully gets Frank and Dorothy back together for good.
