Mu-hoon, a gangster in Busan, is the half brother of Ha-young, a successful photographer. When Mu-hoon is caught having an affair with his boss' mistress, Eun-joo, the two run off with their organization's money. They are soon caught, but although Mu-hoon escapes, Eun-joo is given a scar on her cheek as punishment, and sold into prostitution. A year later, Mu-hoon finds a photograph of Eun-joo in Ha-young's studio, but although he is able to rescue her, he is eventually tracked down by the mob. Threatened with Eun-joo's death, Mu-hoon accepts a job to kill a man, only to discover that his target is in fact his best friend, Man-soo.
