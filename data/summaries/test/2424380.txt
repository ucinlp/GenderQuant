 Young Peggy Pepper  wants to be in motion pictures, so her father  drives them both across the country from their home in Georgia to Hollywood. After some initial disillusionment, she meets Billy Boone  in a studio commissary and he tells her to show up at his set if she wants work. Peggy goes, gets sprayed with seltzer water at her first entrance, and is at first shocked and dismayed to find she is doing slapstick comedy in low-budget "Comet" productions, but she decides to "take it on the chin" and, with Billy's loving support, becomes a success. Soon enough, Peggy is signed to a contract by the prestigious "High Art" studio and, as "Patricia Pepoire", becomes a real movie star. She has fulfilled her dream of playing serious, dramatic roles, but she cuts off contact with Billy and the old comedy troupe, and soon becomes so conceited that her boring performances begin to drive away her public. Fortunately, on the day of her marriage to her co-star, phony-count Andre Telefair , Billy bursts in and, by means of another shpritz of seltzer in her face, as well as a custard pie in Andre's, brings her to her senses, rescuing her career and both of their happiness.
