December 2007}} The character Fang Yuqing, accompanied by her "martial brother" Yue Jianqui travels the Jiang Hu providing what assistance they can offer to those in need. Early in the film two men are attacked by a giant golden bird  but escape when the bird is attacked by another large but darker bird . However, the latter bird carries a child away. The men escape to their village, and subsequently the two main characters arrive. They offer their help, but after defeating the bird and saving the child, Fang's donkey is stolen by another swordswoman. She pursues her and they engage in a fight scene. The thief afterwards reveals that her village of origin is under siege by outlaws. She has heard of Fang's reputation and has baited her in order to test her skills before requesting her help in saving her hometown.  The two make peace and the party continues onwards, eventually stopping to rest for the night at the titular temple. However, what initially appeared to be Buddhist monks are actually disguised villains in the service of one of Fang's enemies, who attempt to ambush the heroes while they sleep by sneaking in via a hidden corridor. This is when the film's climactic fight scene takes place, in which Fang battles the temple's "monks" using double swords. The film ends abruptly at this point due to lost footage.
