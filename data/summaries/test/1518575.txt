The film starts with a parody of the 1972 drama film The Godfather.  It is the wedding of Grandpa Lou and Grandma Lulu, but Chuckie Finster grows increasingly saddened by the presence of a mother, after his own died shortly after he was born. His own father Chaz shares Chuckie's loneliness. Tommy Pickles' father Stu is summoned to EuroReptarland, a Japanese amusement park in Paris, France to fix a malfunctioning Reptar robot which is powered by advanced motion control technology. Tommy, Chuckie, Phil and Lil, Angelica Pickles, Dil Pickles, their dog Spike, and all their parents travel to Paris to take a vacation at the park. Coco LaBouche, EuroReptarland's mean and cold-hearted director, seeks to become the head of Reptarland's company after the current president Mr. Yamaguchi resigns but learns she will need "the heart of a child" to earn the job. Upon the Rugrats' arrival in EuroReptarland, Angelica overhears a conversation between Coco and Yamaguchi, before being caught. To save herself, Angelica suggests that Coco marry Chaz, offering to help in return for getting her own parade in the park. Coco strikes up a relationship with Chaz but her attempts to bond with Chuckie fall flat. The adults and babies meet Kira Watanabe and her daughter, Kimi, who originate from Japan. Kira works as Coco's assistant and helps her to win Chaz's affections. Meanwhile, Spike gets lost in the streets of Paris and falls in love with a stray poodle named Fifi. Kira tells the babies the in-universe origins of Reptar, explaining he was a feared angry monster until a princess revealed his gentler side to make the frightened humans like him. Chuckie decides the princess should be his new mother, and is aided by his friends to reach an animatronic replica of the princess in the park, but they are stopped by Coco's ninja security guards. Angelica informs Coco of Chuckie's wish, so Coco sneaks into the stage production of Reptar and takes the stage as the princess, luring Chuckie into her arms to make it look like she is wonderful with children. Chaz is thrilled deciding she would make an excellent mother and decides to marry her, much to everyone's surprise. On the wedding day, Coco shows her true colours, trapping the children in a warehouse with her aid Jean Claude as their guard and fires Kira after she learns of Coco's plans. Chuckie rallies the children to crash Chaz's wedding using the Reptar robot. They are chased by Jean Claude who pilots the Robosnail robot, Reptar's nemesis, until they fight on a bridge and Chuckie knocks Robosnail into the Seine river. Chaz's wedding in Notre Dame proves to be quite horrendous, with Coco forcing Chaz to go through with the wedding despite Chuckie's absence, and rushing the Archbishop of Paris until she completely loses her temper and throws the Bible at him. Chuckie crashes the wedding, screaming "NO!" which Chaz identifies as Chuckie's first English word; since to the adults, the babies are speaking babytalk. Chaz, seeing Coco for the wicked liar she really is, angrily calls the wedding off. Angelica spills the beans to Mr. Yamaguchi about Coco, who is fired and flees the cathedral in her torn dress with Jean Claude, chased by Spike and Fifi. Chaz and Kira fall in love and get married upon returning to America, Spike and Fifi become a couple, and Chuckie now not only having a new mother but a new sister in the form of Kimi, completing one of Rugrats longest-running storylines, The film ends the Rugrats and the grown-ups having a cake fight, the camera backs up, a piece of cake is thrown at the camera, the screen fades to black and the movie ends. During the credits we see pictures of the family's vacation in Paris with start credits a variant theme of the cover of "Who Let the Dogs Out?" sung by Baha Men until the screen fades to black and final end credits a close theme of the cover of "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'" sung by Geri Halliwell of Spice Girls.
