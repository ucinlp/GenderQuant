 Animals featured: *Coelophysis *Rutiodon *Desmatosuchus *Icarosaurus *Traversodon *Mammal  *Locust  The program starts in the Late Triassic, near modern-day New York City. The narrator explains how the Permian mass extinction led to new forms of life, including, eventually, the most extraordinary creatures ever to walk the planet, the dinosaurs. The camera tracks a Coelophysis through the woods. The program depicts Coelophysis as preying mainly on small animals, such as insects and Icarosaurus. It encounters other, larger non-dinosaurian archosaurs such as Rutiodon and Desmatosuchus. The quick Coelophysis is portrayed as a very successful inhabitant of this world.  Animals featured: *Megapnosaurus  *Anchisaurus *Dilophosaurus The program moves on to the Early Jurassic of Pennsylvania, showing a pack of Syntarsus.These animals are based on an as yet undescribed basal coelurosaur from the Moreno Hill Formation.http://www.arizonamuseumofnaturalhistory.org/exhibits/dinohall/theropods.aspx The program then shows a New Mexico forest of the Middle Cretaceous. Small predatory coelurosaurs scamper through the forest among larger herbivorous dinosaurs. One lone dromaeosaur tries to attack a Nothronychus, only to be slashed by its long claws. An old male Zuniceratops is attacked by the pack of dromaeosaurs and is fatally wounded. Just as it is time to finish off the old Zuniceratops, a forest fire springs up, and most of the dinosaurs escape in all directions. However, the feasting dromaeosaurs are too distracted and become trapped in the fire.  *Tyrannosaurus rex *Triceratops *Edmontosaurus  *Quetzalcoatlus *Ornithomimus  *Purgatorius  *Turtle  *Bird  *Spider  The program explains that dinosaurs similar to Zuniceratops evolved into the famous Triceratops. In the Late Cretaceous, Anatotitan  and Triceratops browse, while Ornithomimus peck at roots and other plants in the area. Quetzalcoatlus soar overhead, looking for carcasses. A young Tyrannosaurus arrives on the scene, and the Triceratops form a defensive circle. Unable to get past the horns of the Triceratops, the Tyrannosaurus attacks a Quetzalcoatlus, which flies away from the potential danger. The next day, the young Tyrannosaurus and its siblings are taught by their mother to hunt. They target an Anatotitan, with the young scaring it into the mother's trap. The T-Rex kills the Anatotitan. Before they can eat, an asteroid smashes into the Gulf of Mexico, engulfing the family of T-Rex in a wall of swirling wood, soil, ash, water, and other debris. Soon, the T-Rex family dies. Despite the depressing and traumatic event, life is described as being resilient, and a turtle is shown emerging from the ground and a bird flies overhead, explained by the narrator as the only dinosaurs left. Out of the ashes, several small possumlike mammals emerge, and the narrator explains that small mammals such as these will eventually evolve into humans and think back in awe to a time "when dinosaurs roamed America".
