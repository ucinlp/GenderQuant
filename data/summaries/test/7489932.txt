Betty receives an invitation to a party from her elderly relative, Grampy. As she strolls along singing "I'm On My Way to Grampy's", she is joined by two moving men, a fireman and a traffic cop - all who irresponsibly drop everything  to go to Grampy's party. Grampy is an eccentric inventor, whose labor-saving devices are of the Rube Goldberg variety. For example, he has a device that moves his entire house to the front entrance whenever the doorbell is rung. The glass shade of his ceiling light is rigged to double as a punch bowl and he has modified an old umbrella to slice a cake into wedges. Grampy entertains his guests by building self-playing musical instruments out of household gadgets . Everyone dances until they drop from exhaustion, the exception being the exuberant Grampy.
