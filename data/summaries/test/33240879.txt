Saravanan  and Selvi Maha  are childhood friends. Saravanan is so madly in love with Maha that it turns him into a killer. Knifing or gunning down anyone who comes in the way of Maha and himself, is almost child's play for Saravanan. From an old man to a posse of policemen, his victims are many and the mayhem is endless. But listlessness and dejection set in when Maha tells him that she is not in love with him. And then it's time for the denouement.
