Liu Jianren and Chen Weijie are two ITE students who are constantly put down for being "dumb" despite the fact that they display a talent for designing and creating gadgets. Jianren comes from a wealthy single-parent home and is estranged from his mother and younger brother. He joins the gang of a local loanshark and becomes a runner. Weijie's father is a compulsive gambler who frequently swings from loving husband and father to crazed gambler running from loansharks. To complicate matters, his younger sister Nicole is academically gifted and pampered by their mother, thus causing frequent quarrels and misunderstanding amongst them. Unknown to the rest of them, Nicole becomes involved in a serious cyberbullying case and later becomes a victim of bullying herself. One day Mr CK is announced as Jianren and Weijie's new class teacher. The young and energetic Mr CK tries hard to connect with the group but they fail to respond. He challenges them to a bet in a radio-controlled helicopter race and if he loses, he will do a nude run. The students defeat him and he honours his promise. The story and the controversy it caused made the national news. However, he had earned his students' respect and they responded accordingly when interviewed by the press. As a result, the board decide against dismissing him. Unfortunately, one of Jianren and Weijie's "inventions" falls into criminal hands. Can Jianren, Weijie and Mr CK stop these criminals before time runs out?
