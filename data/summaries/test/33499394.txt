Krazy Kat is a hired baby-sitter who looks after three kittens owned by a hefty nagging woman. His duties include rocking the offsprings to sleep, make breakfast, and wash the chinaware. All of which he does simultaneously while in his chair. One day, he was so worn out that he took a snooze in his seat. In his dream, Krazy finds himself in a blank room. After looking around for a few moments, he was amazed to access a bed hidden in one of the walls. He then puts on a nightgown and gets in the bed. But before he could sleep, the three kittens, who are already grown and walking, entered the room. They were marching and playing drums. Bothered by the racket, Krazy tells them to play somewhere but the little cats refused. Attempting to force them out, he hurled boots and other objects. Just then, the nagging woman came in, and the kittens were quick to blame the situation on him. Not wanting to experience any abuse, Krazy gets off the bed and walks out of the door. Wondering the outside, Krazy desperately looks for places where he could relax. Finding a rock under some trees, the feline lays down and puts his head on it. However, disturbances like falling branches and rain kept him awake. When the showers ended, Krazy went to lie on a pile of sand, burying part of himself in the dirt. But it appears there was a bear under the pile which rises, rambles, and unknowingly carries him for a few paces. Surprised by this, Krazy jumps off and goes on walking. Krazy then arrives in a city. There, he saw a shop displaying a bed in the window. As good news to him, he reads an ad hiring someone who would like to prove the bed's quality by dozing in it. Krazy goes inside the shop and takes the job. As he sleeps in the featured product, passers-by outside stopped in front of the store and took notice. Finally, Krazy woke up from his dream and realizes he is still in the kittens' home. The kittens were still in the crib and too young to stand on their feet. The nagging woman then comes in and tells him to resume his work.
