John suffered from epileptic seizures and an autism-like developmental disorder, and the Royal Family tried to shelter him from public view as much as possible; the script shied away from presenting the Royal Family as unsympathetic to the Prince, and instead showed how much this cost them emotionally . Poliakoff explores the story of John, his relationship with his family, John's brother, Prince George, the political events going on at the time  and the love and devotion shown to him by his nanny, Charlotte Bill , played by Gina McKee.
