Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle are Navy sailors who have a four day leave in Hollywood. Joe has his heart set on spending time with his girl, the unseen Lola. Clarence wants to just meet a girl. They find a little boy named Donald who ran away from home and wants to join the navy. Taking him home, the two sailors meet his young beautiful singer-wannabe Aunt Susan who is not as old as Donald made her sound. Clarence develops a crush on her, so he asks Joe to help him get Susan to like him. While trying to get Clarence a date with Susan, Joe boasts to her that he personally knows a big time music producer who can audition her. The only problem is, Joe doesn't know the music producer and he's starting to fall in love with Susan himself. Joe also tells the boy, Donald, a story about a sailor and a mouse that turns out to be Jerry Mouse. Clarence eventually meets and befriends a girl from his hometown of Brooklyn.
