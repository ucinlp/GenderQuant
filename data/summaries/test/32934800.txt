{{expand section}} In Japan, Kiriko  and her younger half-brother Daigo  live with their father Kohei  who is a book illustrator. One day Daigo inexplicably beats a rabbit to death outside his school and subsequently stops attending classes. Kiriko becomes worried by Daigo's behaviour while their father ignores the problem as he is caught up in latest job: a pop-up book about The Little Mermaid. Later, Kiriko takes Daigo to watch a 3-D horror film involving a rabbit doll which appears to float out of the screen and into Daigo's hands. Daigo takes it home. That night a large version of the doll pulls him through a cupboard into a fairground. The next night Daigo is pulled by the rabbit through the mattress of his bed. Kiriko follows him this time and the group goes to an abandoned hospital. Later, Kiriko tells her father that "Kyoko is coming. I saw her. Daigo too." Kyoko then recalls a time when she was younger when Kohei arrived home with his pregnant second wife and that she attacked her. Kiriko and Daigo seem to believe that Kyoko has come back to haunt them in a rabbit costume and are determined to destroy the doll.
