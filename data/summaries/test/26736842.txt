During World War II four American soldiers defend a farmhouse against a German assault. With the farmhouse overrun, the area is bombed with three of the soldiers killed and burned beyond recognition whilst the fourth survives but has lost his memory. Upon his discharge from the Army, the soldier returns to America and visits the families of all four soldiers to see if he can discover his identity and past.
