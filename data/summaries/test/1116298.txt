Bogwood, Washington is a pleasant suburban community with a special distinctionâ€”it has more garages per capita than any other town in America. Not surprisingly, Bogwood is also the "Garage Sale Capital of the U.S.A." When retirees Doris & Clayton Fenwick decide to empty their nest of retro-modern antiques, they set the wheels in motion for a frantically funny "g-sale" involving Bogwood's most avid garage sale junkies: Angela Cocci , Ed LaSalle , Dick Nickerson , and BJ Harwood & Helen Ziegler . These colorful characters try to outmaneuver each other to score their ultimate garage sale treasure: an antique board game worth a fortune.
