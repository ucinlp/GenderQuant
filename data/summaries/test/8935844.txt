The film is a comedic parody of horror films of its time, with a cross between The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Friday the 13th with Kristen  and Megan  playing college students planning to attend a concert. After they hit a homeless man with their car, the girls and their friends are systematically murdered.Camp Cuddly Pines Official Site - "About." URL accessed 15 January 2007.
