Parrish, a Union Army ex-officer, plans to sell his land to Anchor Ranch and move east with his fiancee, Caroline, but the low price offered by Anchor's crippled owner, Lew Wilkison, and the outfit's bully-boy tactics make him think again. When one of Parrish's hands is murdered, he decides to stay and fight, utilising his war experience. Not all is well at Anchor with the owner's wife, Martha, carrying on with his brother, Cole, who also has a Mexican moll in town. Parrish eventually gets the upper hand, and when the Wilkisons' daughter, Judith, comes to understand what her family is like and what Parrish has been up against, she realizes they can join forces as peaceful neighbors and perhaps more.
