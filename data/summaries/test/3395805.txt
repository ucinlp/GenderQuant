Edward G. Robinson plays John Ingram, a very successful oil-field firefighter with a young family. All is going so well, he's even bought his own oil well in hope of striking it rich. His greatest fears are realized, however, when a man, William Ramey, from his secret past sees him in a newsreel and shows up looking for a job. Eventually Ramey attempts to blackmail Ingram, who had run from a chain gang years ago and started a new life and family under an assumed name. After a shady deal is made, Ingram is tricked and Ramey turns him into authorities, who then ends up back on a chain gang. Meanwhile, Ramey becomes a very rich man. When Ingram finds out about the success of the man that betrayed him, he plans a daring escape in an attempt to return home and get revenge on him.
