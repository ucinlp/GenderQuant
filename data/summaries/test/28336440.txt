Mavis Hogan  lives with her uncaring aunt  in a squalid Limehouse tenement. Her beauty attracts the attention of an unsavoury Chinese man , whose intentions are encouraged by the aunt. While wandering around Limehouse, she is spotted by an artist  who is in the area sketching East End scenes and people. He persuades her to allow him to sketch her portrait, which he later puts on display in his West End studio. The portrait is seen by a titled Lady , who notices a remarkable resemblance to her own daughter, now deceased. Finally finding the attentions of the Chinese man too much, Mavis leaves her home and walks to the West End with no real idea as to what she will do when she gets there. Coincidentally, she happens to cross the path of the very Lady who noticed her portrait. She is offered a home and the chance to make her way in "society". Adapting remarkably well to her new milieu, Mavis falls in love with the Lady's nephew , but is distraught when she is passed over in favour of another young woman  who has had him in her sights. In her grief, she leaves her new surroundings and returns aimlessly to Limehouse. However the artist tracks her down and asks her to marry him, which she happily accepts.
