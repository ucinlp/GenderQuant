Wizard Anton Mordrid who is sent to Earth by a being called The Monitor to stop Kabal, an evil wizard who grew up with Mordrid, from opening the gate to Hell and unleashing demons upon the Earth. He assumes the role of a Criminal Psychologist, and doubles as the mysterious landlord to Samantha Hunt, a research consultant to the police. Kabal  needs the Philosopher's Stone along with several alchemical elements in order to complete the spell needed to open the gate. Mordrid has spent 150 years waiting for these events to take place. This would mark the beginning of the epic battle between himself and Kabal. The alchemical elements, when mixed within the Philosopher's Stone, will allow Kabal to unleash his minions from the Fourth Dimension upon the Earth. Once he sees the thefts in the news, Dr. Mordrid begins to track down his prey. Samantha begins to persistently push herself into Mordrid's secretive life. The battle for Earth spills over into the Magic Dimension where the gate has been closely guarded by other good wizards. They have proven to be no match for the Kabal, and they are all killed save one. This one magician confirms Kabal's plans for Mordrid, who returns to Earth to prepare his defenses. When Mordrid is arrested for murder, Samantha does what she can to attempt to help prove his innocence. He then tells her of his true nature and his mission, and she agrees to help him escape. In the final showdown, Kabal and Mordrid do battle within the Cosmopolitan Museum. Using his wits and his magical power, Mordrid narrowly manages to kill Kabal and barely prevents the demons from being released upon humanity and destroying reality as we know it. His mission accomplished, Mordrid is called by The Monitor to cross over once again into the Magic Dimension and leave the Earth behind.
