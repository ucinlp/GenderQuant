A film crew in Portugal shoots a black-and-white science fiction film about the survivors on a post-apocalyptic Earth, titled The Survivors. The shooting stops when the production runs out of film stock and money. In an abandoned hotel, the crew waits for money to arrive or a sign from vanished producer Gordon. As they grow restless and bored, the film depicts some of their philosophical thoughts and emotional reactions. Director Friedrich Munro finally sets off to find Gordon in Los Angeles who hides in a mobile home because of money he owes to the Mafia. In the end, both men are shot by an unseen assassin.
