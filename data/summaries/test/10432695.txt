A medical student named Lewis Moffitt protects a private anxiety of the dark, which stems from a shocking ordeal from his childhood involving a dead body. However, he acts unaffected during the first autopsy witnessed by his class, and has an effect on audacity. But this motivates his would-be frat brothers to formulate a morose induction practice, one which is expected to go amiss. The film is narrated by the keeper of a graveyard, who invites viewers to keep him company while he searches for his lost cat. As he steps near a certain grave, he is reminded of Moffitt's ordeal.
