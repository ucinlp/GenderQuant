The Utopian Society is about a group of college students who are put together by their professor to complete a final project: create a utopian society. Like most college students, theyâ€™ve waited until the night before it is due to start working on it. They each come from different backgrounds and have pre-existing assumptions about the others, causing them to want to spend as little time working with each other as possible. But since they have waited until the last minute to start working, they are forced to cram an entire semester's work into one night, whether they like it or not.Official web page
