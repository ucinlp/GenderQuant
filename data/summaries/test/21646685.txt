One evening the Collins family discovers their maid, Mrs. Murdock, dead at the end of their steps; her neck is broken. Evidently, she had an accident; now they need a new babysitter for an upcoming party. The sensible Helen meets little Susan Collins at the discount market and likes her, so she offers to do the job. She does not know Susan's teenage brother Mark: technically skilled and good in school, but restive and cunning; Mark also listens regularly to German marching music from the Third Reich. As soon as the parents have left, he psychologically terrorizes Helen and his sister with electronic tricks. Williams, a school jock whom Mark burned earlier in science class, is out for revenge; Mark murders him with a fencing sword. Ultimately, Mark himself is killed when Helen knocks him onto a spiked German helmet. Mark's parents come home to find the house in shambles; they blame Helen and have her arrested, unaware that Mark lies dead upstairs. Susan  dons her late brother's glasses and proceeds to listen to his Nazi music...and the cycle begins anew.
