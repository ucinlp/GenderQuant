{{Confusing}} Stacy  has a promiscuous past, and after learning of the AIDS epidemic she wants to find a guy whom she knows is clean, so she convinces her childhood friend Melissa  to go to a health spa for singles. They received or bought a basket filled with condoms. At the spa, Stacy meets Nick , a struggling musician, and Vinny, aka the Vin Man , an annoying Italian-American man from New Jersey whom she tries to avoid. At an event called International Night, the men and women all take miniature flags and put them in plunger-shaped hats and then meet the person with the identical flag. After becoming upset over a bad experience at the flag party, Melissa threatens to return to LA. However, Melissa soon connects with a spa staff member, Jamie , who gives her her first orgasm. A confused Stacy returns to LA via the 2PM bus, not knowing that Melissa remained at the resort. Stacy repeats past behavior and brings Nick back to her apartment, however she soon realizes that he's a loser who is taking up all her space and that she actually doesn't really like him. She rents a pink Cadillac and returns to the spa, where Melissa tells Stacey about Jamie and Stacey is relieved. On the way back to LA, Stacey commiserates with Vinny over their disappointment with the spa experience and upon returning to New Jersey, he experiences some life changes. After a period of time, Stacey is shown at Christmas time opening the door and letting Melissa and Jamie in. As they come in, Stacy's now-husband, Vinny, her two young boys, and their dog come down the stairs. Reminiscent of an earlier joke involving an old man and a dog, Melissa and Stacy laugh as the boys attack Vinny and Jamie, Stacy says, "There's your boyfriend" Melissa replies, "So what, there's yours." Finally Stacy says to the camera, "Yeah, that's my boyfriend" and smiles then hugs Melissa. The movie makes frequent use of breaking the fourth wall.
