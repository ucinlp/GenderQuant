The movie tracks three plot lines: interviews at a role playing game convention , Elizabeth’s  interaction with the justice system, and the game in which Elizabeth is a first-time player. Elizabeth violates her house arrest sentence to attend her first game at the invitation of a stranger she meets in a gaming store. Elizabeth risks jail because of the terms of her sentence. In a key plot twist, she chooses to finish the game session: Because her ankle monitor has been inadvertently activated, she is in danger of re-arrest if she does not immediately return home. By the end of the movie it is made plain that in gaming with her new companions, Elizabeth has found her path to redemption, her path away from a life of petty crime and drugs. When her parole officer  asks her, “was it worth it?”, she answers, “yes.”
