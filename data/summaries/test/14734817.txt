The Stooges tells their infant sons  a story about the time they blasted to outer space. In this story, the Stooges are assistants to Professor Jones  who travel to the planet Sunev . The planet's leader, the Grand Slitz of Sunev  greets them cordially enough, but it soon becomes apparent that he has plans to bring prehistoric men to life and take over the planet Earth. No sooner does Professor Jones catch onto the Grand Slitz's plan does he end up being tied up.  In the interim, the Stooges engage in some flirtatious activity with several Sunevian girls . At dinner, an alien leader, known officially as The High Mucky Muck  tells the Stooges to eat heartily and enjoy their meal, for it will be their last. The trio make a quick dash for the space ship, but not before encountering a prehistoric goon . The boys manage to free Professor Jones and destroy the equipment that would have conquered the Earth.
