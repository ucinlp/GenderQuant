In 1890s San Francisco, boxing is illegal. James J. Corbett , a brash young bank teller, attends a match with his friend Walter Lowrie . When a police raid nets Judge Geary, a member of the board of directors of Corbett's bank, Corbett's fast talking gets his superior out of trouble. The judge is looking to improve the image of boxing by recruiting men from more respectable backgrounds and having them fight under the Marquess of Queensberry rules. He has even imported British coach Harry Watson ([[Rhys Williams  to evaluate prospects. Watson finds that Corbett, raised in a combative Irish immigrant family headed by Pat Corbett , has excellent fighting skills; Geary likes his protégé's seemingly-polished manner. However, Corbett's arrogance irritates many of the upper class, particularly Victoria Ware . They clash frequently, but Corbett is attracted to her, and his limitless self-confidence and charm eventually overcome her distaste for him. Meanwhile, Corbett becomes a professional prizefighter. He acquires a manager, Billy Delaney , and introduces a new, more sophisticated style of boxing, emphasizing footwork over the unscientific brawling epitomized by world champion John L. Sullivan . After winning several matches, Corbett finally gets the opportunity to take on the great man. Corbett's method of boxing baffles Sullivan, and Corbett wins not only the title, but also Victoria. The victory over Sullivan, crowning Corbett as new Heavyweight Champion sets up one of most touching and best acted film scenes in Flynn's career. Corbett's victory party is unexpectedly interrupted by the defeated Sullivan. The former champ has come to personally bestow the championship belt to Corbett. It is Ward Bond's scene, , on paper, but Flynn's masterful underplaying, showing just the right amount of humility and respect for his fallen foe is something to behold and proves beyond a doubt Flynn possessed considerable acting skills.
