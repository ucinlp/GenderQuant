Following the death of her husband, 10-year-old Paul's mother Mel  comes to rely on an old friend, Lenny , who is also a pimp and drug dealer. Soon Paul  must take care of both his mother and his younger brother. When Mel's friend and fellow user dies, Paul must confront the fear that has been gathering in the pit of his stomach: having lost his father, his mother too may abandon him due to her heroin addiction. Even with his limitations as a child, he takes action to stop this from happening. As this is happening, Paul befriends a pregnant Louise , an older girl who is also a drug addict. Most of the film was shot on location in east London with West Ham United's Boleyn Ground  featuring prominently. As Paul is a West Ham supporter the team's anthem "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles" is a key part of the film's soundtrack.
