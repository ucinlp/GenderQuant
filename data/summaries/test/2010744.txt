In 2016, the United States Navy develops a program to deal with international terrorists and other enemies of the state quickly and quietly; in addition, the program is authorized to test new technology that will achieve these objectives. This includes three new single-seat attack jets with impressive payload, speed, and stealth capabilities known as the F/A-37 Talon series. Over 400 pilots apply to participate, but only three are chosen: smart hotshot Lieutenant Ben Gannon , tomboyish Lieutenant Kara Wade , and street-wise, philosophical Lieutenant Henry Purcell . Their first test mission scores 100/100, based on maximum inflicted casualties with minimum collateral damage. In addition, the U.S. Navy hires Dr. Keith Orbit  to develop an Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle  codenamed "EDI"  and piloted by artificial intelligence. This autonomous fighter jet is placed on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in the Philippine Sea to learn combat maneuvers from the pilots. This sparks a conflict between two schools of thought: The first argues that human pilots are superior to machines in that they possess both creativity and moral judgment, whereas a machine cannot fully appreciate the ugliness of war; additionally, if robots take humans' places on the front line and no one ever died in war, then war would no longer be terrible and could end up as a sort of sport. In contrast, a machine pilot is not subject to the physical limitations of a human pilot, can calculate alternatives to achieving objectives faster and more accurately, and is  not subject to ego. The team is sent to train the EDI to practice air combat maneuvers, or ACMs, when they are suddenly reassigned to take out the heads of three terrorist cells at a summit in downtown Rangoon. EDI calculates that mission success can only be achieved through a high-risk strike, which could be fatal for a human pilot and create numerous civilian casualties in the process. Command orders EDI to take the shot, but Gannon ignores the order, defies command, and takes the shot himself. While the mission is successful, EDI learns and takes note of Gannon's defiance. The mission is a success, and the planes return to the carrier. The UCAV-EDI plane is hit by lightning, and while seemingly damaged it quickly recovers, but its neural network is affected. Already a sophisticated AI, the EDI begins to learn exponentially, developing a rudimentary ethical code and an ego. Its handlers and technicians are unsure of how to handle the situation, but refuse to take him offline. On their second mission, Wade calculates that the mission objectives  cannot be achieved with acceptable civilian casualties. The mission is scrubbed but the EDI disobeys orders and fires missiles at the nuclear warheads, causing the predicted radioactive backlash. Control steps in and orders the Talons to bring the malfunctioning UCAV-EDI back to base. Gannon asks for permission to destroy the aircraft, which is eventually accepted. Purcell, being the closest to the plane, is given the order to shoot. EDI dodges this rocket as Henry dodges the explosion but flies straight into another mountain side, killing him. The other two try to track down and either destroy or commandeer the UCAV. But when Wade loses control of her left wing and canard and subsequently ejects over North Korea, only Gannon is left to stop the EDI from executing a twenty year-old war scenario called "Caviar Sweep". In an attempt to complete his mission, Gannon chases EDI into Russian territory over the Buryat Republic, and after several attacks from Russian aircraft causing damage to both planes, he calls a truce with the UCAV in order to both keep it from falling into enemy territory as well as rescue Wade from North Korea. He is ordered to make an emergency landing with EDI in Alaska by his commanding officer, Captain George Cummings . Cummings is held responsible for the incident by the brass and is threatened with a court-martial and possible discharge from the military; he attempts to eliminate all witnesses to the event by leaving Wade stranded in North Korea, assigned men to eliminate Gannon in Alaska as well as bringing Orbit there to erase EDI's data. Suspecting Cummings of treachery, Gannon makes a cautious landing in Alaska. When EDI is placed into an interface by Orbit, he expresses sadness and regret for his transgressions, and Orbit realizes that the artificial intelligence he created has developed its own sentience to the point of being alive. With this discovery, Orbit becomes disinclined to carry out his order to erase EDI's memory. Gannon narrowly escapes an assassination attempt by his "doctor", and then meets Orbit in the hangar where EDI is kept. After ensuring Dr Orbit's escape, Gannon flies off to North Korea with EDI, contacting Captain Dick Marshfield  to inform him about Cummings' deceit. Marshfield confronts Cummings and places him under arrest, but Cummings commits suicide instead. Gannon later finds an exhausted and injured Wade on the border between North and South Korea, and leaves EDI to help her fend off North Korean soldiers. The two pilots make a run for the border, but are chased by a Korean People's Army Mil Mi-8 helicopter. Out of ammunition and taking damage from the Mi-8, the EDI sacrifices itself doing a Kamikaze-like final attack, flying into the helicopter, allowing Gannon and Wade to escape into South Korea, and are found by US military forces soon afterward. After attending Purcell's funeral aboard the Abraham Lincoln, Gannon confesses his feelings of love to Wade. After the credits, Eddie  is shown in pieces though still functional.
