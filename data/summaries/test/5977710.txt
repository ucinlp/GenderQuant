The Bug's first victims are square record moguls Lawrence Milk and Jive Davis, who are hypnotized or otherwise prodded into killing themselves, and  'Scream' Dorsey, whose car is simply taken over and then run off a cliff. The Bug, his henchmen and henchwomen  are opposed by the J-Men, a group of government agents hired by the legendary J. Eager Believer. Besides the Chief and his bumbling sidekick, Agent Barton, the J-Men include Agents Spike, Claire and Lance, Buzz Cufflink, James Armhole, Rocket Jock , the Lone Star , the Caped Madman (clips from [[Captain Marvel , Spy Swatter (clips from [[Spy Smasher , Sleeve Coat, Juicy Withers, and Admiral Balzy. Many of them appear to die horrible, inescapable deaths in the course of the film. The J-Men work in cooperation with the F.C.C. , opposing the Lightning Bug with Muzac , then with a bomb to blow up the Lightning Bug's base on the Moon. However, the Lightning Bug beats them to it, by turning his stereo up too loud and blowing up the Moon himself. At the end of the film, Agent Barton mournfully recites the list of J-Men who supposedly gave their lives in the epic struggle against the Bug. The Chief laughs, then starts choking on a cigar he is smoking. After he stops choking, The Chief points out that J-Men are flexible enough to survive any life-threatening situation, and the final clips  show exactly how each J-Man escaped their particular peril.
