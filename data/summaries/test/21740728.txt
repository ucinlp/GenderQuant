"Everyone knows someone who's had a run-in with an angry racoon. Some people even believe that racoons are smarter than people."{{cite web}} Outside the small rural town of Independence, college buddies Ty Smallwood  and Zach  join a small group of college students visiting the Raccoon Creek Campground to have what they hope will be the best summer break of their lives. Their hopes are dashed when they have run-ins with frat guys, rednecks, hippies, bible students, and an inept set of camp counselors. Things go from bad to worse when they discover that maniacal raccoons have targeted the camp with an intention to wreak havoc on all humanity. When one camper is murdered, the rest seek revenge and retaliation.
