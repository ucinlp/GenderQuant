Bob Hodges  is a 19-year veteran of LAPD's C.R.A.S.H. unit who has just been teamed with rookie Danny McGavin . The older cop is diplomatic on the surface, preaching "rapport" to gang members to encourage them to offer help when it is truly needed, and recognizes that every action cops take is scrutinized by the people they are trying to help. These lessons are lost on McGavin, and his actions bring him quick notoriety that affects Hodges. Amidst this, a murder of a Bloods gang member leads to a series of escalations between two other street gangs, a relentless intertwining of seemingly random incidents that culminates in a gang war that finds the two partners in the middle of the Crips, Bloods and Mexican gangs' attempts to right what they perceive as wrongs against their respective crews. Near the end of the film, the police have one final stand against the gangs. Hodges is shot and mortally wounded in the process. McGavin goes up to him and cries as he dies. Sometime later, McGavin has a new partner, a rookie black cop who grew up in the neighborhood where they patrol. McGavin tells him a story about a bull that Hodges told him at the beginning of the film. The film ends with McGavin and his new partner driving and continuing their patrol.
