On a short flight to Catalina Island off the California coast, a passenger on a seaplane calling himself Roswell T. Forrest  gets sick. Hildegarde Withers and the others aboard are startled when he is found dead upon landing. It appears to be murder to Miss Withers, but she has a tough time convincing local Police Chief Britt  and coroner Dr. O'Rourke . When she contacts her friend, Police Inspector Oscar Piper , for more information about the deceased, he recognizes the name: the man was a vital witness in a case against a crime syndicate and had a price on his head of $10,000. He flies from New York to assist her in investigating the case. When he arrives, the pair argue over which of the people aboard the plane is the killer: *Joseph B. Tate , a famous Hollywood director *struggling actress Phyllis La Font , who is angling for a part in Tate's next movie *honeymooners Kay  and Marvin Deving  *Captain Beegle , a retired, self-confessed former rum runner, and *pilots Dick French  and Madden . Withers suspects poisoning , but before this can be confirmed, the body is stolen. While Piper questions those involved, she discovers that McArthur , the gangster who had offered the reward for Forrest's death, has registered at the hotel under the flimsy alias of Arthur Mack. When she eavesdrops on his telephone conversation, she learns that he will be leaving an envelope for someone. She purloins it from the mailbox and finds $10,000 inside. More murders occur. Marvin Deving is shot and killed just before he can reveal some information to Piper. Meanwhile, Withers and Piper learn that the first victim was not Forrest, but his bodyguard Tom Kelsey. He and the real Forrest  had switched identities. McArthur is also found dead. Though it is staged to look like a suicide, Withers notices that the pistol in his hand is not his own . When an employee complains that the fish in the hotel pool are all dead, Withers finds a pack of cigarettes discarded nearby; one of the cigarettes had fallen into the water. With the murder weapon found, all the pieces come together. Withers takes Piper to see the grieving Kay. She offers the widow a cigarette, then casually mentions where she got it. When Kay refuses to smoke it, Withers tells Piper that McArthur's gun must be in the room. Kay pulls it out and tells them that she will have to kill them both now, but Withers manages to distract her, enabling Piper to disarm her. It turns out that the Devings thought they had been doublecrossed by McArthur when they did not receive their reward . When Marvin tried to betray McArthur in return, he was killed by his employer. Kay then did in McArthur.
