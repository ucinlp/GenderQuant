Casper is fighting to retain control of the city's criminal activities when Frank Janser , an honest man and mayoral hopeful, begins a strong anti-crime campaign. Casper tasks Grace to dig up some dirt on the mayoral candidate and ruin his chances of election. Grace finds some dirt when he meets the man's sexy redheaded secretary, June Lyons . He follows her to a jail where she's picking up her red headed and equally sexy kleptomaniac sister Dorothy . Ben Grace eventually falls for June and gives her incriminating evidence about his boss, causing violent Caspar to kill a well-known newspaperman, and leave the city. Ben Grace takes over the racket, yet he has good instincts. At the same time, June is nervous because her sexually charged sister is attracted to Ben. Caspar returns for revenge and shoots Ben several times. The police enter the house and arrest Casper with gun in hand. A wounded Ben is taken to the hospital, as June and Dorothy follow in tow.
