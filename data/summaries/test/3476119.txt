And older man  is sitting at a table with a younger man  at a diner discussing a matter over cigarettes and coffee. A newlywed couple sits at the table next to them discussing how the wife lost all their money gambling on craps. Another man, Bill , is outside of the diner making a phone call but the matter being discussed is unclear. The younger man tells his story which the older man asks to hear again for further clarification. The younger man tells how he steps outside when he is losing at gambling and takes a bill out of his pocket and writes his name across the back for a good luck charm and uses on his next bet. However, he never makes it back into the casino as he runs into his friend Steve who he lets borrow the $20 bill. The husband hands the waitress a $20 bill and talks about how once the money is gone it can't come back and how the world isn't perfect. Bill is still outside on the phone discussing the matter. The young man continues the story and states that he headed back to the room where he was supposed to be meeting his wife, Steve, and Steve's wife but only his wife was there. He then saw the $20 bill with his name on it and his head started fill up with terrible thoughts. He took the $20 bill and won almost $8,000 gambling with it. The husband recounts his marriage proposal and lights up his last cigarette. Bill gets off the phone, goes inside, and orders coffee and cigarettes which he pays for with a $20 bill. The younger man then confesses that he wants to kill Steve and his wife and that his friend knows a guy named Bill that is in the "business" but that he wants to take back that he paid to have them killed. The older man gets the change back and notices a name written on the back of a $20 bill and drops it onto the floor. Bill goes back outside to his car and opens the trunk which has Steve inside. The couple gets up to leave and grabs the $20 bill off of the floor. The older man says to the younger man that drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette will make everything right. They both notice the couple outside kissing before they get into the car. Bill drives off down the deserted desert road.
