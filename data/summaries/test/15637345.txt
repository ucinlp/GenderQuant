Walter Franck, playing "Wolf", as the half-crazy assistant to Walter Hanssen's "Dr. Heller", an inventor of robots, murders his master, and attempts to take over the world with his death-ray equipped robots. He is prevented from attaining his goal by Siegfried Schuerenberg's "Baumann", a mining engineer, and dies at the hands of the robot creations. In the happy end of the movie, robots have been transformed into industrial laborers, thus freeing humans for a more worthy and humane life of working on small farms.
