Eddie  owns a London barber's shop and leads an apparently everyday life. However, under an assumed name he has a secret second identity known to no-one but his assistant Ron ([[Bill Owen  &ndash; he is also one of England's public hangmen, called on periodically to travel to prisons around the country to perform judicial executions. One evening during a rainstorm, Eddie goes into a public house for a drink and meets the bedraggled Frankie , an aimless, world-beaten drifter.  The pair fall in love and are soon married, although Frankie's vagueness about her past hangs unspoken over the relationship. Eddie's father dies, leaving him the family barge business on the River Thames. He hands over the barber's shop to Ron and takes over the business, setting up home with Frankie on one of the barges. Eddie hires a Scandinavian seaman Olaf  to work for him, and soon the arrogant Olaf has Frankie in his sights. Despite herself she is attracted to him, but tries to deny her feelings. Meanwhile Eddie is called away for reasons he cannot explain, and Frankie increasingly finds herself struggling to rebuff Olaf's advances during Eddie's absences. When he is next called away, she begs him either not to go or to take her with him, but as neither is an option for Eddie, she pleads with elderly bargeman Bill Shackle  to stay with her while Eddie is gone. Shackle is unable to grant her request due to other commitments. Eddie returns unexpectedly early, and discovers Frankie and Olaf in an apparently compromising situation. A fight ensues between the two men, during which Eddie is knocked overboard and fails to resurface. The police are called by a witness to events, and Olaf is arrested for murder as it is presumed that Eddie's body has been carried away on the tide. In despair, Frankie commits suicide by shooting herself. However, Eddie has managed to swim to shore and takes refuge with Ron. Olaf is convicted of murder and sentenced to hang. With nobody but Ron aware that Eddie and the alleged murder victim are one and the same, Eddie is summoned to carry out Olaf's execution, and relishes the prospect of being able to avenge Frankie's death. When the time comes however, he is unable to go through with it and confesses his identity at the last moment. He returns to the barber's shop and prepares to end his own life.
