The plot revolves around an ape playing sports. Jack, a three-year-old chimpanzee who is the subject of an experiment involving sign language that is performed by Dr. Kendall. However, Dr. Kendall loses funding for his research and Mr. Kendall's boss, Mr. Peabody, sells Jack to a medical research lab, much to Dr. Kendall's dismay. Unfortunately, Dr. Kendall dies  from a heart attack. Dr. Kendall had set up Jack to be taken away from the lab, but Jack was sent to Canada by mistake. In Canada, Jack befriends a lonely teenager named Steven Westover and his deaf sister, Tara . Steven soon discovers that Jack has an uncanny ability to play the sport of ice hockey and Jack joins Steven's junior league hockey team when it is discovered that there is no rule that chimpanzees can't play hockey. However, just before the championship, Dr. Peabody returns to reclaim Jack. At the end of the final game, Jack shoots. "Check the net," they say. Sure enough, he shot his shot so fast, it went straight through the back of the net. Due to the realistic nature of the plot, viewers must be reminded that this is indeed a work of fiction.
