Synopsis in brief: Three friends—Jānis, Zigis and Ričards—are mobilized into the Latvian Legion during World War II, where they fight against the Red Army in the Volkhov Marshes. Zigis is killed while attempting to desert to the Soviets. Twenty years later the two surviving friends meet again. Jānis has stayed in Soviet Latvia and accepted the new order, while Ričards arrives from abroad, having become an agent to the Western powers hostile to the Soviet system. While produced during the Soviet period and being full of Soviet propaganda clichés, the film rather objectively describes the events surrounding participation of Latvian Legion in battles against Soviets on the Leningrad Front during World War II.
