{{Plot}} The film depicts events that occurred after Knox moved to Perugia, Italy, in September 2007, as a foreign exchange student attending language classes at the University for Foreigners. Knox shares an upstairs flat in a cottage with Kercher, a British student, and two Italian women, Filomena and Laura. In October, Knox meets Raffaele Sollecito, an Italian student of computer engineering, at a classical music concert, and she begins to stay at his house each night. On November 1, Kercher dies in her bedroom from stab wounds. Searching for evidence in the days following the murder, police question both Knox and Sollecito about recent events. Knox admits that she and Sollecito had "smoked weed" on the night of November&nbsp;1, and states that they had gone to his house, watched a film on his computer, and gone to bed. Meanwhile, the chief prosecutor of Perugia, Giuliano Mignini, discusses the case with the coroner and forensic investigators from Rome. The coroner makes mention of multiple bruises on Kercher's body, stating that she had probably fought back in the struggle, and the prosecutor inquires whether more than one person could have been involved in the fatal attack. In an interrogation at the police station, an officer informs Sollecito about telephone records indicating that he has called the emergency number after, and not before, the Polizia Postale had arrived at the cottage. A policeman warns Sollecito that his rich, influential family will not be able to protect him. Sollecito asserts that Knox had told him to make certain claims, that she had not really been with him at the time of the murder, and that he had not "thought about the contradictions" in his alibi. Police subsequently approach Knox, who has been performing cartwheels while waiting alone in the hall, and ask her to explain a text message that has been found on her cell phone. The officers claim that Knox had left the message for her employer, pub owner Patrick Lumumba, on the night of the murder to tell him she would meet him later. Knox replies that, in English, the words amounted more to "I'll see you around" than "meet me later". Surrounding her, the police order Knox to tell them about meeting Lumumba that night, or suffer the consequences. Several hours later, Knox states that she had met Lumumba in a local square, that they had gone to the cottage with Kercher, and that Lumumba had entered Kercher's room before her death. Knox, Sollecito and Lumumba are arrested. Under police interrogation, his face swollen with bruises, Lumumba insists that he hardly knew Kercher and that he has never visited the cottage. Some days later, he is released when a university professor reveals that he had been with him at the pub Le Chic, and could not have been at the cottage at the time of the murder. The parents of Knox travel to Italy to help their daughter, and hire lawyers for her defense in court. The forensics team finds a bloody fingerprint in the murder room that does not match the prints of either Knox or Sollecito. The resulting manhunt leads to the arrest of Rudy Guede, originally from the CÃ´te d'Ivoire, whom Knox and Kercher had met weeks earlier when he was playing the guitar in the downstairs flat at the cottage with the Italian men who lived there. Guede later goes to trial and is found guilty of murder and sexual assault. Knox and Sollecito are indicted in the same court judgment. Knox and Sollecito are tried jointly in 2009 on the charges of murder, sexual assault, staging a crime scene, and transporting a lethal knife. Luminol tests in the cottage hallway revealed small footprints, which were too small for the men to have made, but approximated the size of Knox's feet. DNA experts testify that Knox's blood was found on a bathroom tap, mixed with Kercher's. In Sollecito's apartment, police found a large kitchen knife, with Knox's DNA on the handle and four cells of Kercher's on the blade. A defense expert testifies that 10 cells would be required for the purpose of evidence, since four DNA cells indicated "contamination" rather than evidence that the knife had been used as a murder weapon. The prosecution insists that Knox had argued with Kercher and stabbed her, as presented in an hypothetical flashback set in Kercher's room. The chief forensics investigator testifies that Sollecito's DNA was found on a metal clasp severed from the back strap of Kercher's bra . Sollecito's attorney asks when the bra clasp was discovered. The investigator replies that it was photographed on the first day after the murder, but only collected 47 days later, during which time it had been moved from its original position and passed between the various members of the forensics team. Although the attorney claims that this small amount of DNA is possibly the result of contamination, the investigator replies that, with the exception of the clasp, only a cigarette butt in the kitchen held Sollecito's DNA, stating, "DNA does not fly around". Eventually, in December 2009, the jury delivers a verdict of guilty: Knox is sentenced to 26 years in prison, Sollecito to 25 years. Knox's father reassures his daughter that he and her mother will appeal the verdict in a new trial. The film closes with a caption stating that the parents of the real-life Knox have both been charged with criminal slander for claiming that police had abused their daughter, and that they face three years' imprisonment if found guilty. Note: The film is now shown with an amendment noting the subsequent acquittal of Knox and Sollecito on appeal.
