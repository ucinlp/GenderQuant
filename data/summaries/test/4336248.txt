Squad leader Sgt. Larkin  and his men are getting ready to take a well-deserved rest after being on the front line for several weeks. During an interlude at a church and later at a tavern, the senior non-commissioned officer, Technical Sergeant Pike , happens upon John Reese , a former sergeant who is now a private. Reese is the quintessential troubled loner, managing to alienate himself from almost everyone in the squad right from the beginning. The company commander, Capt. Loomis , is worried because Reese goes crazy when there is no fighting, but Pike comments that he is a good soldier in combat. Sgt. Pike informs the men that they will shortly be going back on the line. After much complaining, the men get ready to move out. The remaining members of 2nd Squad include con-man/thief Corby , the mechanic-who-can-fix-anything Corporal Henshaw , the easy-going, somewhat-naive kid, Cumberly , Polish refugee Homer Janeczek ([[Nick Adams  and family man Kolinsky . The morning after they arrive at their appointed post and dig in, the men realize they are spread so thin that any reconnaissance by the Germans will quickly reveal how weak the American defenses are. One stroke of good luck is the sudden and mistaken arrival of an Army company clerk, Private First Class James Driscoll . Larkin quickly puts Driscollâ€™s jeep to use by having Henshaw rig it to backfire and sound like a tank. Driscoll himself is put to use improvising misleading radio messages for a hidden microphone left by the Germans in an abandoned pillbox . A German raid results in Cumberly's death, but Reese manages to kill three Germans in close combat. So wound up by the combat that he can barely stand still, Reese recommends hitting the German pillbox on the other side of a field filled with mines and barbed wire to make the enemy think the Americans are at normal strength. Larkin decides to go find some help and see if he can get permission from Pike for the attack, but is killed in an artillery barrage. Reese decides to proceed without orders and persuades the others to go along. The attack fails, with Henshaw fatally burned by his exploding flamethrower tanks and Kolinsky dying screaming from shrapnel through the back and abdomen. Reinforcements do arrive soon thereafter, along with Sgt. Pike and Capt. Loomis, who berates Reese and decides not to court-martial the insubordinate private only so he can be at the front of the American assault at dawn. The pillbox fires on the advancing Americans. Reese throws a satchel charge into the pillbox. When it is tossed out by the defenders, he grabs it and, by now gravely wounded, carries it in, blowing up the fortification and himself.
