The story begins in a mental asylum run by nuns. Michelle, a troubled teenager, is once again returned to the asylum after escaping and is put in a straight jacket and then locked in a room. She manages to get the attention of new girl, Marie, a quiet girl who just seems to sit in the garden in a rocking chair, who the staff can't seem to get a word out of. Marie helps Michelle by removing her straight jacket and the pair run off together. At first, Brigitte wants to leave on her own but Marie wants to go with her and the two form a friendship. They follow a group of burlesque dancers who they encounter in an old scrapyard and as they roam the countryside with this group they get involved in crime and murder. They later meet a group of women who try to rape Marie and the kill them and as the police close in, Michelle and Maire try to fight back against them but are gunned down and they share a kiss before they die.
