Set in a drought-ridden rural town in the West in Depression era America, the film tells the story of a pivotal hot summer day in the life of spinsterish Lizzie Curry. Lizzie keeps house for her father and two brothers on the family cattle ranch. As their farm languishes under the devastating drought, Lizzie's family worries about her marriage prospects more than about their dying cattle. Even the town sheriff, File, for whom she harbors a secret yen, will not take a chance on plain Lizzie. The arrival of a charming con man named Starbuck, promising to bring rain in exchange for $100, sets off a series of events which enable Lizzie to see herself in a new light.
