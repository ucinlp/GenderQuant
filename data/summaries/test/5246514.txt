Kosi ([[Arya  and Selva , are contract killers working for a middleman with the ironic name of Sami . Director Vishnuvardan portrays this morbid telling of two orphaned youths with incredible realism of trust, friendship, and ultimate betrayal masterfully. Kosi is an unblinking man with a stubborn feel for life thereby refusing to love and be loved. Selva, deaf and dumb, is equally intrepid although he has a heart ticking beneath the dark, dire exterior. Saroja , a salesgirl at a garment company is an outgoing and sprightly girl and is a friend of both Kosi and Selva. She is in deeply in love with Kosi but the latter only finds her presence as a nuisance whereas Saroja's chief manager who stubbornly tries to make Saroja sleep with him. In stark contrast to this romance, is the love between Selva and Sandhya  who are smitten with each other after some fate-based encounters that bring some light-hearted humor to the film. As the film progresses, Kosi and Saroja end up sleeping together when Kosi begins to drink excessively, promptly making him start to realize his feelings for Saroja. Unfortunately this new-found happiness does not last as their profession does not allow it to. Kosi and Selva set out to assassinate Avinashi Nachimuthu Gounder , a business tycoon and uprising politician as instructed to do so by Sami. Kosi and Selva mutually agree to make this assignment their last and to begin leading normal lives with their newfound loves Saroja and Sandhya respectively. A new twist occurs in the story where the people who hired Saami told him to finish off Kosi and Selva once the job is completed. Upon preparing for the assassination, Kosi becomes unable to think as he finds himself overwhelmed with feelings of love, at which point Selva decides that he should finish the execution himself and Kosi should go speak with Saroja. Kosi visits Saroja at her home where he finds her with shivering and with bruises. Saroja then tells Kosi how her chief manager intruded the house and sexually violated her after she refused to love him. Infuriated at this, an emotionally shaken Kosi finds the manager and beats him to a horrific death. Meanwhile, Selva had cunningly assassinated Avinashi Nachimuthu Gounder and is returning home. The manager's boss who happens to be a big don himself finds out that Kosi is the one responsible for the manager's death and seeks out revenge. He gets a hold of Saami and blackmails him to bring Kosi to him for his life.Unknowingly, Kosi goes with Saami and is killed in the ambush from a gunshot to his head. Selva who returns later finds out about this unfortunate event and seeks revenge. He visits Sandhya and questions her about his Kosi's murder and the people responsible for his death. He intrudes the don's house and kills everyone in his way including the don. When Selva returned home, Sandhya was shocked to see him with his many injuries. Sandhya tells Selva to wait by the door while she went to call for an auto rickshaw to get them both to the hospital. Meanwhile, the irritating boy who appeared before begging for a job, stabs Selva in the same approach as Selva did in the introduction scene in the hotel room. The boy who was still recovering for the shock that he actually stabbed Selva, stabbed him again multiple times when he saw Sandhya rushing towards him. Selva dies from the multiple wounds and falls on Sandhya's lap. In the scene before the credits, a scene is shown where Saami is having a chat with the boy who committed the murder. The scene is shown as a deja-vu where Saami convinces Kosi and Selva that they're all part of this scheme together. Saami uses the same dialogue to the boy letting the audience connect that the boy will end being killed too.
