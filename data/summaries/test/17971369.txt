The movie is based on actual events. On March 24, 1980, Romero was killed, and three Roman Catholic nuns and a lay Catholic missionary were killed on December 2, 1980, by Salvadoran death squads, possibly funded by the United States. Jean Donovan had been in El Salvador for over two years helping the children that she was so devoted to. These women were raped, tortured, and killed by members of a Salvadoran death squad.
