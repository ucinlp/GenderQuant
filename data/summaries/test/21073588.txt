Anwar, a Muslim, lives a middle-class lifestyle in Lucknow, India, with his mother, brother, and sister-in-law, Suraiya. Anwar is researching on ancient Hindu mandirs. The family rents out a room to a poor widow and her attractive daughter, Mehru, whom Anwar falls in love with. Anwar is certain of Mehru's love for him and is shocked when he finds out that she has eloped with Udit, his friend, who is about to immigrate to America. He informs her mother, who in turn calls upon her nephew and kin to locate Mehru. They find the couple aboard a bus. Udit is killed, while Mehru is beaten. A guilt-ridden Anwar takes shelter in an ancient Hindu temple in Dholpur carrying a bag, which contains drawings of mandirs and notes on Lord Krishna, Devi Meera, and Mehru. This bag ends up with the police, who now believe that Anwar is a terrorist who is planning to detonate bombs in sacred Hindu temples. The place is surrounded by the police, politicians who are anxious to win the Hindu vote, the media, and a huge crowd who are here to see the show. Set against post 9/11 scenario, amidst the craze for Valentine's Day, Britney Spears, Osama Bin Laden, George W. Bush, and the American way of life, Anwar must now examine his options.
