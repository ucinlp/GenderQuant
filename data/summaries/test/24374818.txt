Sister Rachel Taylor  of Boise, Idaho is an eager young missionary of the LDS Church who has been sent on an 18-month long mission to Austria. Rachel finds herself having a hard time adjusting to her new cultural surroundings in the foreign country. Due to differences in opinion, she is also unable to get along with the companion missionary that was assigned to her by the church. She is reassigned to work with another companion but this relationship fares no better. Taking a note from the very teachings she is trying to spread, Rachel eventually learns to accept others' differences and get along peacefully with her companions even if they disagree on how to go about conducting the work for which they volunteered.
