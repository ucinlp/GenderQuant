Billy Pickton  is with his attorney  in a police interrogation room, about to be questioned by a police detective  and district attorney . As the detective and district attorney converse about Billy's case, the movie is told in flashback. Billy is shown running a severed pig's head and hoofs up and down the body of a prostitute , in a strangely sexual sequence, as the detective narrates. Billy's modus operandi of luring prostitutes to his sister's expensive home to drug and kill them is shown in a series of episodes. His first victim  is drowned in a bath tub, placed in a large wheeled trash can, taken to the family pig farm, and fed into a woodchipper. The remaining episodes follow a similar pattern. The next victim, played by Kate Hackett, is drugged and abused in one of the bedrooms of Billy's sister's house. The abuse is interrupted by a housekeeper , who quietly observes Billy move the drugged woman into a trash can and wheel her to the pig farm. There, he suffocates her and feeds her hand into a meat grinder. Billy forces alcohol down the throat of the next victim . He drags the incapacitated woman around the house, up the stairs, forcing her to swallow pills before killing her. She is later fed to the woodchipper. Throughout the film, the detective implies and then finally accuses Billy of mixing the remains of the victims with pork meat that was then sold to a national food market chain for public consumption. In flashback dinner scenes with his sister  and brother , Billy does not answer questions about why the pork products "taste so good." After the next victim  is strangled and buried alive, Billy is interrupted by three teenage hitch hikers, one of whom he treats for a spider bite before sending them on their way, unharmed. Billy narrates how his mother made an audio recording of his father's  death, which forever colored his view of women as "evil whores." There is a brief flashback of Billy dancing and frolicking with a prostitute , and attending church. Billy's next victim, Annie , is treated to a tour of the house attic, and their relationship starts to take a bizarre romantic tone. She reads an Edgar Allan Poe poem to Billy before he drugs her -- she wants him to kill her. However, he cannot bring himself to feed Annie to the woodchipper, because as the detective intones, "She was the only woman he ever cared for." In the pig farm basement, the brother discovers Billy and Annie's corpse, which leads to Billy's arrest. The movie ends with title cards that explain that Billy may have killed "as many as 135 ... unfortunate women."
