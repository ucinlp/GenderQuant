In Cardiff, Wales, a young Polish seaman named Bronislav Korchinsky  returns from his latest voyage to visit his girlfriend Anya . When he finds a woman named Christine  living in her apartment, the landlord tells him that he evicted Anya and gives him her new address, which is also the home of a young girl named Gillie Evans , an orphaned tomboy who lives with her Aunt. Gillie's angelic face hides the fact that she is a habitual liar, and she dearly wants a cap gun so she can play "Cowboys and Indians" with the boys in her neighbourhood. Korchinsky arrives shortly after she gets into a fight, and she begins to like him as she leads him to her apartment building. Korchinsky finds Anya in her new apartment, but she wants nothing to do with him. Dissatisfied with waiting while he is at sea, she has been seeing another man, a sportscaster named Barkley . When Korchinsky assaults her, she defends herself with a gun, but he takes the gun from her, becomes furious with jealousy, and shoots her dead. Gillie witnesses the incident through the mail slot in the apartment door. When the landlord investigates the noise, Gillie hides in a closet, and when Korchinsky hides the gun near her, she takes it and runs into her apartment. Wanting to keep the gun, Gillie lies to police superintendent Graham  about what she saw. Korchinsky follows her to a wedding at her church, where she shows the gun to a boy who sings with her in the choir, and afterwards he chases her into the attic. After he takes the gun from her, they make friends and he agrees to take her to sea with him as he flees the country. He learns that a Venezuelan merchant ship, the Poloma, will leave port the next day, and Gillie leads him to a hiding place in the countryside, where he entertains her by re-enacting his overseas adventures. When the Poloma is due to sail, and the scene of the vessel locking out is actually filmed at Avonmouth, he persuades Gillie to let him go alone, retrieves his identification papers from Christine, and signs on to the ship. Meanwhile, the police investigate the murder. The mother of Gillie's choir friend finds the bullet Gillie gave him, the boy tells Graham about the gun, Christine brings a photograph of Korchinsky to the police, and Barkley admits to owning the gun and seeing Anya after she was shot. Some men find Gillie at the hideout and take her to the police, where she continues to lie, identifying Barkley as the murderer. With Barkley as a suspect, she admits to having seen the crime and re-enacts it for Graham at the apartment, but she accidentally reveals that she knows the killer is Polish. She still denies knowing Korchinksy, but Graham drives her to the pilot Station at Barry Docks and takes her on a Pilot Boat to the Poloma as it approaches the boundary of territorial waters three miles from shore. At this point Gillie is obviously trying to obstruct Graham's progress. When he confronts her and Korchinsky aboard the Poloma, they deny knowing each other, and the captain stops him when he arrests Korchinsky because the ships navigating officer plots Poloma's position just outside the three mile limit which is beyond the jurisdiction of the British police Finally, Gillie falls overboard while trying to stow away on the ship so she can remain with Korchinksy. Being the only person to see her fall, Korchinsky ignores the risk of arrest and dives into the water to save her and they are both rescued by the police boat. Korchinsky admits his guilt after Gillie hugs him, and Graham commends him for his bravery in saving her.
