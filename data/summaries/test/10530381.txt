In 2001, Japanese American painter Jimmy Mirikitani, born Tsutomu Mirikitani, over 80 years old, is living in the streets of lower Manhattan. Filmmaker Linda Hattendorf takes an interest and begins to engage with him to create a documentary of his life. After the destruction of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, the debris- and dust-choked streets are deserted. When Hattendorf finds Mirikitani, in his usual spot along the wall of a Korean Market, near the intersection of MacDougal and Prince Street in Soho, she offers him shelter in her small apartment. During this period, a beautiful and curious friendship flowers, as Ms. Hattendorf begins the long process of re-integrating Mr. Mirikitani back into society, recovering, among other documents, his social security card and passport. Over the months they live together, she uncovers his true identity and history. Ultimately she reunites him with his niece, the poet Janice Mirikitani, and surviving sister and finds him his own apartment in an assisted living facility. Over the course of the film, audiences learn about Mirikitani's past, including the injustice experienced by American-born Japanese during the Second World War, his career as an artist, his life among artists, including Jackson Pollack and his years Ms. Hattendorf documents Mirikitani's epic journey, from California, to Hiroshima, back to California, to his imprisonment in an internment camp, to his sojourn across the country to Long Island and finally to New York City, where he was employed as a wealthy man's cook. When his employer died, Mirikitani became homeless, spending almost a decade in Washington Square Park. Later, he moved to the streets of Soho, where he created an "atelier," on the streets, and worked days and nights on his artwork. Hattendorf's highly personal film about justice deferred, loss and redemption has won many awards in the United States and abroad and, in the end, brought both Hattendorf and Mirikitani well-deserved and hard-won regard.  In May 2007 The Cats of Mirikitani aired on the award winning PBS series Independent Lens.
