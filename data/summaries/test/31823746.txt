The movie is a Romanian-Italian co-production, about the drama of the refugees from Bessarabia , in World War II. It brings homage to the Romanian troops, who free Bessarabia from the Red Army, which occupied it in 1940. The movie wins the great prize at the Festival of Venice, in 1942. The movie shows also true images from contemporary newsreels, with the refugee columns running away. Maria Cebotari plays the role of Maria Teodorescu, opera singer from Bessarabia, who was in Chisinau with her 8-year-old son at the time of the invasion. The boy was taken somewhere in Odessa. The mother was told that he will be maintained in a camp, where he will be educated as a man again, as Soviet. The mother agrees to sing Russian songs in theaters, in taverns, only to get her son back. Maria Teodorescu sing in those places, sharing pictures of hers. One such image is found by chance by her husband, who is in Romanian army with the rank of captain . In the end the family reunites. Unfortunately, the history of the movie was a sad one. Because of the invasion of Soviet troops in Bucharest in 1944, the movie becomes banned, along with many others, and the actors in the movie are taken into arrest. Many such movies were either destroyed or censored. Nothing was heard of this movie for more than 50 years. Luckily, someone re-discovered it in the Cinecitt√† archives in Rome, and it was shown for the first time in Romania in December 2006.
