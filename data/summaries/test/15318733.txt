A group of scientists working in the north of Chile are about to launch the first Chilean space mission into space. Just before the launch is due the scientists and engineers are involved in some industrial dispute over wages and working conditions which leads them to walk out of the ground control centre and abandon the project and its director. The project director can’t accept this and still decides to launch the mission into space with the astronaut Guillermo. Soon he realizes he doesn’t know how to bring the astronaut back to earth alive. The Chilean astronaut is left orbiting the earth until an old Russian scientists from the Sputnik programme – living in Chile – enters the scene. Ultimately the old Russian scientist contacts a cosmonaut left in the old MIR space station who finally manages to force the Chilean space ship back into earth's orbit with a push.
