The film begins with an introductory sequence involving the main characters and images from space and introducing many of the film's visual leitmotifs.<ref nameDargis |firstThis Is How the End Begins |urlNew York Times |date2 January 2012 }} A shot from outer space shows a giant planet approaching Earth; the two planets collide. The film continues in two parts, each named for one of two sisters. In part one, "Justine", a young couple, Justine and Michael, arrive at their wedding reception at a resort owned by Justine's sister, Claire, and her husband, John. On several occasions, Justine looks at a particular red star, which seems to shine brighter than normal; John, an amateur astronomer, identifies it as Antares. Over the course of the evening, Justine is frustrated by various personal and professional difficulties. Her bitter mother insults her in a toast, for which John attempts to throw her off of his property. Justine's boss repeatedly harasses her to write ad copy before the end of the reception. Claire becomes frustrated with Justine and chastises her for not reacting to the reception with the joy she had anticipated. Justine drifts away from the party several times – including to take a nap with her young nephew, Leo – and becomes increasingly distant from her family and new husband. Michael attempts to console Justine with a wedding present – his purchase of an apple orchard for them to enjoy as they grow older – but Justine seems unmoved. When she and Michael retreat to their room for the evening, she brushes off his advances and goes walking on the grounds, where she has sex with a coworker in a sand trap. At the end of the party, Michael leaves her. At dawn the next day, Claire takes Justine horseback riding; Justine notices that the red star has disappeared. In part two, "Claire", Justine has become severely depressed. She comes to stay with Claire and John, who live in the mansion where the reception took place. Justine is unable to carry out normal everyday activities like taking a bath or even eating, but gets better over time. John explains that the reason for Antares' disappearance was the rogue planet Melancholia, which has eclipsed the star. Melancholia, a blue gas giantMelancholia: when worlds collide, beautifully that had formerly been hidden behind the sun, becomes visible in the sky, approaching Earth. John is excited about the planet, and looks forward to the "fly-by" expected by scientists, who have assured the public that Earth and Melancholia will pass each other without colliding.  Claire is very fearful that the end of the world is imminent, despite her husband's assertions that their family is safe. She searches the Internet and finds a site describing the movements of the planet Melancholia around Earth as a "dance of death" in which the apparent passage of Melancholia initiates a slingshot orbit that will bring the planets into collision soon thereafter. Justine tells Claire that life on Earth is evil, and that Melancholia will hit. Justine further informs her sister that her intuition tells her that Earth is the only planet in the universe with life, and that the destruction of Earth will mean the end of all life. On the night of the fly-by, it seems that Melancholia will not hit Earth. John, Justine, and Claire watch Melancholia rise on the night of the flyby and view it through a telescope. After the fly-by, background birdsong abruptly ceases. The next day, Claire realizes that Melancholia is circling back and will collide with Earth after all. John, who has come to the same realization, commits suicide. Claire finds his body and then tries to conceal his death from Leo and Justine. Faced with the impending collision, Claire becomes distraught and suggests a "farewell party" on the terrace with wine and music. In response, Justine, unfazed by the impending doom, demeans Claire's idea before going to comfort Leo. She makes him a protective "magic cave", a teepee of wooden sticks, on the lawn of the estate. Justine, Claire and Leo enter the shelter as the planet approaches. Claire continues to remain agitated and fearful, while Justine and Leo remain calm and hold hands. Melancholia collides with Earth.
