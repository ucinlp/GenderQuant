{{expand-section}} The movie follows the events and hardships suffered by the nine companies, roughly 550 men, of the United States Army 77th Infantry Division  that had been completely cut off and surrounded by German forces a short distance away in the Argonne Forest. The force was led by Maj. Charles W. Whittlesey, who was disparagingly described as a "New York lawyer" by his commanders. The battalion was part of what was supposed to be a three-pronged attack through the German lines. The battalion believed another American force was on its right flank and a French force on its left, not knowing that they had both retreated. The battalion lost contact with headquarters. Whittlesey sent several runners to headquarters, but none of them returned. He ended up having to rely on carrier pigeons to communicate. During the siege, American artillery began firing on the German position in the forest as the Americans cheered. However, the artillery began falling on the American line, killing numerous men in friendly fire. Whittlesey sends a pigeon to headquarters with a message saying they were being hit by their own artillery, saying, "For heaven's sake, stop it". The headquarters receives the message and stops firing. Witnessing the incident, the Germans attack the disoriented American force, but they are repelled by the Americans in fierce fighting and retreat back to their trenches. After several days and numerous repelled attacks, the Americans are still holding on, despite desperately low supplies, forcing them to reuse bandages and other medical supplies and take food off dead soldiers. The Germans capture two Americans, one of them severely wounded, and begin using them to try to negotiate with Whittlesey. The uninjured prisoner receives good treatment from a German officer who speaks fluent English after having lived in America for several years. He tries to convince the prisoner that there is no hope, to which the American responds, "They'll never surrender." The American eventually agrees to bring a message from the Germans to Whittlesey urging surrender after his captor says he wants to save lives. The Germans then send him escorted by a German soldier with a white flag back to the American line with the message. Whittlesey responds by throwing the flag back towards the Germans. The Americans continue to hold despite relentless attacks and low supplies. Eventually, an American pilot is sent out to search for the force, and flies right over their position. Realizing it is an American plane, the Americans make noise to try to get the pilot's attention. The Germans prepare to shoot at the plane, but their commander tells them to hold their fire because if the pilot knew the Germans' location he would also know the Americans'. The pilot locates the Americans and signals to them, and the Germans begin firing at him. The pilot is critically wounded, but manages to circle the location on his map and navigate back to the airfield, dead by the time he lands. The men at the base see his map and bring it back to headquarters. After six days, reinforcements finally arrive at the American lines. Major General Robert Alexander arrives in a car, telling Whittlesey there will be "commendations and promotions for everyone". Whittlesey is furious about the debacle, and is further angered by Alexander's insistence that the casualties they suffered were "acceptable losses". Alexander reveals that the battalion's hold in the middle of the German line enabled the Americans to break through the entire line. Alexander offers to bring Whittlesey back to headquarters in his car, to which Whittlesey responds, "That's not acceptable, sir. I'll stay with my men."
