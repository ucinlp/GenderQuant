On the countertop, Larry the Cucumber is seen wearing a shoe on his head and asks Bob the Tomato why he's wearing it. Bob explains that he got a letter from Latasha Robins of Savanah, Georgia, and she wants to know what loving your neighbor really means. Bob begins to tell The Story of Flibber-o-loo.  The first story, based on the Biblical parable of the Good Samaritan. Larry lives in Flibber-o-loo, where everybody wears a shoe on their heads while Junior Asparagus lives in Jibberty-Lot where everyone wears a pot on their heads. Flibber-o-loo and Jibberty-Lot fight by throwing pots and shoes at each other. Larry goes out with his pet wind-up lobster where bandits  steal his milk money and put him upside down in a hole. Although both the Mayor of Flibber-o-loo  and a Flibbian doctor  come upon Larry, they are both "too busy" to help, and explain this through song. Soon after, a boy from Jibberty Lot  comes and helps Larry out of the hole. After seeing the kind act of a supposed enemy from Jibberty-Lot, the Mayor decides that Flibber-o-loo and Jibberty-Lot should no longer fight. Now, instead of fighting, the two cities are loving and throw flowers and candy to each other.  Larry tries to look for his missing hairbrush. Pa Grape and Junior Asparagus try to help, but Bob tells him he gave the hairbrush to the Peach who has hair.  The second is a parody of Star Trek and the title is an homage to the movie The Gods Must Be Crazy. After Junior tells Dad Asparagus that he isn't sure about going to invite a new kid named Fernando to his 6th birthday party because Junior thinks that he's weird, Larry & Bob arrive in their small ship to take Junior Asparagus to their ship, the USS Applepies (a parody of the [[USS Enterprise . Upon arriving, they discover that the ship is in the path of a giant meteor. While the ship's engineer, Scooter , frantically works to fix the ship's engines, Junior suggests that two oddball crewmen, the always-hungry Jimmy and Jerry Gourd, help save the ship when it is determined that the meteor is in fact a giant popcorn ball. Rocketed into space via the escape pods, the pair eat the meteor before it can collide with the ship. After Bob & Larry return Junior home, he tells his Dad that he has reconsidered and will invite Fernando to his party. QWERTY's verse at the end of the show is "Love your neighbor as yourself", Leviticus 19:18.
