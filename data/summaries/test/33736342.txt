Cast member Lizzy Caplan described the plot: "It's about a guy whose life has been ruined by a YouTube video that has gone viral and so he's been hiding out and he gets brought back into civilization  by his really manipulative, horrible brother. And everybody in his life is sort of terrible [and it's about] how he deals with that."{{cite web}}
