Harry Dunne  is home schooled throughout his life and finally gets his chance to go to regular school. At the same time, another guy named Lloyd Christmas([[Derek Richardson  , who has been adopted and exchanged several times until he was accepted by Ray , the school janitor, as shown in the deleted scenes - becomes overeager, and gets out of school to get into school. Harry bumps into Lloyd on the way, in search for a treasure his mother  asked him to find, and as if it were destiny, the two instantly became the best of friends. Lloyd introduces Harry to his 'friend', Turk , the school bully whose main function in life appears to be making Lloyd's life hell. After putting Lloyd in a dustbin, he hoists the two friends up a flagpole. Meanwhile, the corrupt Principal Collins  is searching for a way to get a large amount of money to get a condominium in Waikiki. Seeing Harry and Lloyd getting hoisted on a flagpole makes Principal Collins establish a 'special needs' class to swindle $100,000 from the local community. Obviously, Harry and Lloyd are more than thrilled to help, and thus find themselves signing up people who are 'different' for the class. These include a reluctant Turk; a teen named Toby  who broke his leg in a skateboarding accident - and whom Lloyd believes is a 'little crippled boy'; Toby's gorgeous girlfriend, Terri ; geeky Lewis , whom Harry and Lloyd believe is a centaur after seeing him half-dressed in his horse mascot costume; Cindy , also known as Ching-Chong, an Asian exchange student who later becomes Turk's girlfriend; and Carl , a badly injured football player obsessed with his sport. Jessica ([[Rachel Nichols , a headstrong student, is suspicious of Principal Collins' sudden contribution. Jessica asks Harry for information. Harry, who thinks that she is flirting with him, turns to Lloyd for courtship tips. A repulsive disaster involving Jessica's bathroom and a melted chocolate bar scares her father  and directs her attention to Lloyd. Soon, Harry and Lloyd get into a fight over Jessica, without her knowing it. Inevitably, the two make amends when Harry and Lloyd realize that they were nothing without each other . It so happens that the Special Needs class was asked to build a float for President's Day at that time; instead of building a float with George Washington as the main attraction, they change it to look like Principal Collins with repeated recordings of his evidence. Principal Collins is arrested before he can get away, and Harry and Lloyd are regarded as heroes. However, just like in the original film, the duo's advances to Jessica were in vain, since it turned out that she had a boyfriend. As the couple rode off, Harry and Lloyd vowed never to fight and risk their friendship over a woman, again; that vow was repeatedly broken. As the guys head home, they are approached by the Felcher Twins  in a sports car, who offer to take them to a huge party. Harry and Lloyd turn them down, and Harry gets covered in mud and dirties Jessica's father's car at the end of the film.
