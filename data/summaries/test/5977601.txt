John Wisdom  is a young man just out of college. He's branded a felon after a grand theft auto conviction on the night of his high school graduation, and as a result can't hold down a decent job. Seeing little future for himself, Wisdom takes a left turn: he becomes a criminal "for the people," evocative of Robin Hood. After seeing news reports about all the impoverished farmers and working class being sent to the bank to pay ownership debts, Wisdom goes on a bank robbing spree with his girlfriend, Karen ; they erase loan and mortgage records, buying time for the poor to pay their debts. With the FBI after them, things take a turn for the worse when a panicky Karen murders a local sheriff. She and Wisdom make a run for the Canadian border, but when Karen is shot by a police helicopter, Wisdom leaves her in the care of some university medical students. He resumes his flight, but is surrounded by police and federal agents at a college football field. As Wisdom appears to be reaching for his gun, he is riddled with gunfire and dies. John wakes up where the film started, in his parents' bathroom. He emerges from the shower and proceeds to get ready for his job interview. His entire story has apparently been a daydream.
