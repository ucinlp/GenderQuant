In the middle of a forgotten French suburb, a family and close friends day-dream of life and love. In this debut feature by writer/director Nassim Amaouche, we become embroiled in their world, discovering the ties that bind the various characters, crafted by a brilliant French-Arab ensemble cast that includes Jean-Pierre Bacri, Dominique Reymond, Yasmine Belmadi and Alexandre Bonnin. The film revolves around conscientious Francis, his recently freed ex-con son Samir, neighbour  Maria and her imaginative son Jos√© - who deals with all this by escaping into a Wild West fantasy world where his father is cowboy hero Gary Cooper.
