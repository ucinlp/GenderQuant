The story concerns the difficulties faced by an interracial marriage between an African-American office worker and a white divorcee. The climax of the film is a highly emotional courtroom custody case in which the woman's angry ex-husband demands custody of their daughter, charging that the child's welfare is threatened by the environment created by her marriage to a black man.
