From Boxoffice Magazine: "Arnold... a super-straight business student in college... [due to] his amazing agility with accounting practices, makes of cousin De Souza's modest "grass" enterprise one of the mightiest businesses on the stock exchange listings, much to the consternation of both the law-enforcement officialdom and crime syndicate chieftains of the City of Brotherly Love.""Arnold's Wrecking Co." Boxoffice Magazine. January 7, 1974.
