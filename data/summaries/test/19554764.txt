Salsa dancing and 'El Corazon', a London Salsa Club provide the backdrop for the love-inspired efforts of three unlikely romantics: Fergus , who arrives in London from his native Liverpool, on a search for Maureen  Docherty , the high-school sweetheart he jilted years ago. Eddie , the incompetent mugger who falls for Jocelyn , the neurotic "absentee grave tender" . Frankie , a hopeless romantic trapped in the fifties and still sharing a house with his ex. He pursues the elegant and snobbish Eleanor , art restorer by day and Salsa dancer by night. All are connected by Jimmy , a cab driver, and a place, 'El Corazon'.
