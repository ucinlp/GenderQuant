The film is a Science fiction, where dead Mithun's brain gets transplanted in Madhoo and she takes revenge of Mithun's killers. II. Gajendra Singh is a very wealthy contractor who, with his partner Madanlal, sells government provided building materials into the black market in exchange for weak ones. A civil engineer and his supervisor find out and upon their meeting are subsequently murdered by Gajendra. While Dr. Vijay is unable to treat the two workers, he gets a letter informing himself that his friend Amar, a gold medalist engineer, is the replacement engineer for the crooked contractors. Amar, just like his predecessors, is very honest and won't do with what his bosses tell him to. After an attempt to bribe Amar, the contractors get beaten up and Amar threatens to expose them. Joginder, Gajendra's son, is a rogue who sets his eyes on Asha, Amar's eventual wife-to-be. On their wedding night, Gajendra, Madanlal, and Joginder all stab Amar, and Asha, when finding out, goes crazy enough leading to brain damage. Vijay then transplants Amar's brain into Asha's body and Asha eventually kills the trio one by one. Before she hangs Gajendra, she is shot by the police, and in a dying soliloquy, claims that she will be with Amar for eternity.
