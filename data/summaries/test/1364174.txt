Down on his luck, veteran movie director and writer Harry Dawes  is reduced to working for abusive, emotionally stunted business tycoon Kirk Edwards , who has decided he wants to produce a film to stroke his monumental ego. Looking for a fresh leading lady, they discover, in a Madrid night club, stunning dancer Maria Vargas , a blithe but proud spirit who likes to go barefoot and has a troubled home life. Maria takes an instant dislike to Kirk but trusts Harry, whose work she knows. Thanks to his expertise and the help of sweaty, insincere publicist Oscar Muldoon , her film debut is a sensation. Kirk tries to control Maria's life by publicly ordering her to stay away from wealthy Latin American playboy Alberto Bravano , but Maria rebels. She is a great star, but Maria is not satisfied. She envies the happiness her friend Harry has found with his wife Jerry  and wants a prince charming of her own. Alberto is too frivolous and shallow for her. When he berates her in public for supposedly ruining his luck at a gambling table, he receives a slap in the face from a stranger. This turns out to be Count Vincenzo Torlato-Favrini , who offers Maria his arm. They walk out. Maria has found the great love of her life. They wed in a lavish ceremony, but there is a problem. The count and his spinster sister  are the last of the Torlato-Favrinis; without offspring, the noble line will die out. Unfortunately, he is incapable of fathering a child because a war injury has left him impotent. He tells Maria about this on their wedding night. Sometime later, Harry is in Italy and an unhappy Maria tells him about her husband and confesses that she is pregnant. She believes her husband will want this child and plans to tell him about it that night. However, her husband had suspected she was unfaithful and shoots her before she could tell him about the child. Harry arrives just as the shots are fired and does not tell the count about the pregnancy. The story ends  with flashbacks at her funeral.
