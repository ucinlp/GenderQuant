Helena  works with her parents  at their family circus, but desires to run away and join real life. At the next performance, after Helena and her mother have a heated argument, Helena's mother collapses and is taken to the hospital. Ten days later, while Helena is staying with her grandmother, she finds that the doctors determine that Helena's mother requires an operation, and Helena can only blame herself for the situation. That night, she wakes up in a dream-like state and leaves her building to find three performers outside. As they try to perform for Helena, a shadow encroaches on the area and two of the performers are consumed by it. The third performer, Valentine , a juggler, helps to quickly direct Helena to safety through the use of magical flying books. She learns they are in the City of Light which is slowly being consumed by shadows, causing its widely-varied citizens to flee. Soon Helena is mistaken for the Princess. She and Valentine are taken to the Prime Minister . He explains that the Princess from the Land of Shadow stole a charm from the City of Light, leaving their White Queen  in a state of unnatural sleep and the City vulnerable to the Shadows. Helena notes the resemblance of the Queen and Minister to her mother and father, and offers to help recover the charm along with Valentine. They are unaware their actions are being watched by the Queen of Shadows  who has mistaken Helena as the Princess of the Land of Shadows. The two attempt to stay ahead of the shadows as they follow clues to the charm, learning that it is called "MirrorMask". Helena discovers that by looking through the windows of the buildings, she can see into her apartment room through the windows on drawings she created on one wall of her room, and discovers that a doppelganger of herself is behaving radically different from her; the doppelganger soon becomes aware of her presence in the drawings and begins to destroy them, causing parts of the fantasy world to collapse. Soon, Valentine betrays Helena, allowing the Queen to capture her in exchange for a large reward of jewels. The Queen warps Helena's mind to believe she is the Princess. Valentine eventually has a change of heart and returns to the Queen's palace, and helps Helena to break the Queen's spell on her. The two search the Princess' room, and Helena discovers the MirrorMask hidden in the Princess' mirror; the two flee the castle with the charm. As they escape to Valentine's flying tower, Helena comes to realizes that her doppelganger in the real world is the Princess, who had used the MirrorMask to step through the windows in Helena's drawings to come into the real world. The Princess destroys the rest of the drawings in Helena's room, preventing Helena from returning, and Helena and Valentine disappear in the collapsed world. The Princess takes the drawings to the building's roof to disperse the shreds into the wind, but discovers one more drawing Helena had made on the back of the roof door. Helena successfully returns to the real world and banishes the Princess to her realm. At the same time, the White Queen finally awakens and the two Cities are restored to its natural balance. Helena returns to her apartment to learn that her mother's operation was successful; Helena returns to happily help at the circus. Sometime later, Helena becomes fascinated by the approach of a young man, strongly resembling Valentine, who wants to be a juggler for the circus.
