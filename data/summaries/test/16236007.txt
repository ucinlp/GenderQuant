The Pink Panther is a small-time violinist who desperately tries to play with the orchestra at the Hollywood Bowl. His ultimate goal is to have the group perform his own theme music in place of Ludwig van Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. After quietly playing his theme on his violin during the symphony, the angered conductor comes over to the group of violinists to inspect their violin bows. The Panther's bow manages to fire a blast of smoke like a gun into the conductor's face, prompting the ejection of the pink feline a second time.  The sly panther manages to sneak back into the Hollywood Bowl, and starts utilizing both a tuba and a trumpet to blast his theme song once again. The conductor becomes even more infuriated, and tries a third time to remove the Panther from the proceedings. Pinky disguises himself against the fancy pedestal of a harp, making himself invisible to the enraged conductor. Thinking he has succeeded in ridding the music hall of the panther, the conductor returns to his podium, unaware that the Panther has substituted his baton with a small rocket. The rocket then shoots into the air and takes the conductor up with it, and then the rocket explodes and drops the conductor far away, allowing the Pink Panther to conduct the orchestra in a rousing rendition of his Pink Panther theme. In the end, Henry Mancini makes a brief cameo, applauding the panther's performance.DePatie-Freleng website
