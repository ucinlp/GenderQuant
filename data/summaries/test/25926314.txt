Tweety stumbles into Sylvester's house looking for shelter and Sylvester hesistates if he saw a tweety bird in the same manner Tweety wonders if he saw a 'Putty Cat'. Sylvester snatches him inside but has to hide Tweety in a vase covered by books, when Granny appears. While an injured Hector remains bedridden, Sylvester causes whatever diversion he can to stop Granny from spotting Tweety, making Granny give multiple doses of medicine to Hector. When Hector gets in Sylvester's way from eating Tweety, Sylvester injures himself by dropping a refrigerator on top of him. Tweety spikes Hector's medicine resulting in Sylvester ingesting the disgusting stuff.
