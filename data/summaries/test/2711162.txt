Former conman Nick Blake , a soldier returning to New York City after World War II, looks up his old girlfriend Toni Blackburn  to get the money she has been holding for him while he was in the army. She claims that she lost the money investing in a nightclub before selling it to her boyfriend, Chet King . Unconvinced, Nick get his money back from his ex-girlfriend's new beau and leaves town. Nick meets up with old conman Pop Gruber , who tells him that he's getting too old for the con game and that if he keeps it up, he will end up as "selling pencils on the side of the road." Another con artist, Doc Ganson , has spotted a sucker, but has neither the money nor the looks necessary for the job. When he hears that Nick is in town, he reluctantly approaches Pop to recruit him, even though there is bad blood between them. The plan is to have Nick, a lady's man, romance rich recent widow Gladys Halvorsen  and persuade her to invest in a phony tugboat business. Nick agrees on condition that he get two thirds of the proceeds, increasing Doc's bitter resentment of the younger, more successful man. The plan hits a snag when Nick falls in love with the intended victim and attempts to back out of the "big con". When Charles Manning , Gladys's business manager, finds out about Nick's criminal past, Nick admits the truth to Gladys. However, she believes he can change and refuses to let him go. Nick decides to pay the others the $30,000 he promised them using his own money. However, Toni shows up and learns of the aborted scheme. When she tells Doc that she is sure Nick intends to marry Gladys , the gang kidnaps the widow for a larger share of her money. Luckily, Pop is able to follow them to their hideout. In the ensuing gunfight, Nick rescues Gladys, but both Doc and Pop are killed.
