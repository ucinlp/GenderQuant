Daffy, tired of Speedy's singing and antics, decides to take a vacation  from the mouse. However, unbeknownst to him, the mouse has stowed away in his luggage. Speedy reveals himself once they are on a cruise liner, and Daffy quickly tries to get rid of him, but is tricked into the ocean, narrowly avoiding becoming shark bait. He decides to stay in his cabin, but Speedy again tricks him and gets his lunch. Thoroughly annoyed, Daffy attempts to fool Speedy into jumping overboard by pulling the emergency whistle, but instead is himself fooled into jumping ship. Finally, Daffy drops the anchor as Speedy runs past, missing and sinking the cruise ship. Speedy resumes singing atop Daffy's stomach, who is forced to save them both.
