Neela  and Avinash  are medical students, and they quite sympathise with each other. However, Avinash lives a poor lifestyle and does not want Neela to live this kind of life. Actually, the main reason behind his unwillingness to live with Neela is that he comes to know that he is cancer patient and that he will not be able to go with Neela very far which he hides from everybody including Neela. When Neela meets one of her students' elder brother, businessman Shekhar , she instantly catches his eye. He goes to propose marriage to her but her brother, Kalidas  advises him to first meet with Avinash. Shekhar meets Avinash, tells him of his feelings and intentions, and Avinash immediately approves of him. Shekhar and Neela get married, and cannot understand why Avinash did not attend the ceremony. After a successful honeymoon, both return to their regular lives, and Shekhar wants Neela to continue with her medical studies. It is then that he suspects that Neela has been meeting with Avinash, and asks his brother to spy on her. The information that Shekhar finds lead him to the conclusion that Neela is in love with Avinash, and confronts her. An intense argument is followed by Shekhar drinking his medicine, and passing away. The next day Neela is arrested on the charge of murder. Surprisingly, Avinash is nowhere to be found. Neela has now to face the trial all alone. Nadira testifies in favor of Neela, the court acquits her and Dr Chandra  takes her in his guidance for making her a top surgeon.
