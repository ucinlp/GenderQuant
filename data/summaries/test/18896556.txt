New South Wales Police Sergeant Scobie Malone  is summoned to Sydney by the Premier of New South Wales  who at the time was the controversial Sir Robert Askin. The Australian High Commissioner in London, Sir James Quentin  is wanted for a 25 year old murder charge, that the Premier, Quentin's gruff political rival, has discovered. Upon arrival in London, Malone meets Lady Quentin  and her husband the sophisticated Sir James, as well as Sir James's secretary . Sir James offers no objection to the murder charges but demands several days before departure as he is conducting delicate peace negotiations. As Malone waits as a guest of the High Commissioner, he prevents assassination attempts against Quentin by a dangerous spy ring headed by Maria Cholon . Filmed in Australia and London, the film was the last big screen appearance of Franchot Tone who plays the American ambassador. Rod Taylor is memorable in one of the few roles where he played an Australian. He plays Malone as a tough single Outback policeman unlike the married Sydney Detective Sergeant of the original bookshttp://www.epinions.com/review/High_Commissioner/content_165491019396 Taylor's unsophisticated integrity is contrasted with the London diplomatic scene throughout the film.
