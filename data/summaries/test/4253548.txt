The story takes place towards the end of the 19th century in Bengal. Bhubaneswar Chowdhury  is a rich and oppressive Zamindar . He is planning to please the British so that they bestow on him the Raibahadur title. There are quite a few contenders and so something unique has to be done, so he decides to put Queen Victoria's face on the body of the Goddess Durga whose clay idol is made every year for Durga Pooja. On the other hand he also wants an heir and since he blames the failure on his elder wife Mahamaya  he marries again, the much younger Jashomati . Both these wives compete against each other in an ego struggle. In his pursuit for a son, Bhubaneswar tries everything from trying to force himself on Jashomati while a priest reads hymns for conception near the bed, ordering Mahamaya, in a drugged state, to fulfill the carnal desires of five sexually deprived Brahmin priests, whose excuse to sleep with her is a distorted version of the rites of the Ashwamedha yagya. Although she luckily escapes the fate due to the untimely ending, Jashomati, while in her traumatised and lonely state, gets physically drawn towards a young sculptor . It's in this centre of all this that the sculptor makes his masterpiece, his tribute, and seals Jashomati's ultimate fate.
