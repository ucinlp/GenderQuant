{{Expand section}} A bankrupt playboy makes a plan to obtain money. He reads in the news about the death of three wealthy married rich men who die in a plane crash. Disguised as a ghost, that night he visits the three widows. Scared, they not only give him money, but also consent to having sex with him. When the three women become pregnant, the father hires a priest to exorcise the little ghosts from them.
