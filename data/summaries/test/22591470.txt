The Hunter Family leaves their two dogs and cat with their friend John Longridge to watch while they are abroad. When Longridge leaves for a hunting trip, the animals also depart on their own journey in an attempt to get back to their real home. Longridge believes the animals are being cared for by a neighbor who is taking care of his house, while the neighbor thinks he has taken them along with him, so it is a while before anyone knows the pets are missing. The three animal friends travel 250 miles through the sparsely populated wilderness of northern Canada, helping and encouraging each other as they encounter hunger, rugged terrain and various dangerous situations before finally arriving back home.
