Nanna Maria, the matriarch of a Fijian extended family living in a suburb of Auckland, New Zealand, feels that the heart and passion has gone out of her clan. One morning, she demands that her grown grandchildren put on a big pig-roast at which she will name her successor. The grandchildren &mdash; Soul, Charlene, Hibiscus, Erasmus, and her favorite, Tyson &mdash; reluctantly turn up, Tyson with his Danish girlfriend, Maria. Family conflicts play out as the difficult day progresses, but in the end the grandchildren—and eventually Nanna's children too—join with cousins and others in a traditional celebration.
