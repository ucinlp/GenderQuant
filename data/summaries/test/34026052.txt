The film deals with contemporary issues affecting youths. It begins in 2004 with a student protest during the corrupt Bihari administration of Laloo Prasad Yadav, intended to free the characters played by Ajay Kumar and Deepak Singh. The film goes in a flashback of these two prisoners. Singh is a temporary Government teacher who twice passed the written entrance examination for the Indian Police Service but was not selected for employment. Kumar is an brilliant student but from a poor family, which meant that he could not afford the {{INR}}two lakh bribe that was necessary in order to secure a job. He has a friend who is of a lower caste, which adds to his woes because the relationship caused friction with both his older brother and society generally. While Kumar needs money for the bribe and to pay a dowry on the marriage of his sister, his friend needs finance to start a roadside tea stall and so escape the need to continue working for his cruel employer. The young men determine to kidnap a hotel owner in order to get money that they need, but instead they mistakenly kidnap the most wanted Naxalite leader in Andhra Pradesh. The story unfolds with two friends trying to release this naxalite but are arrested in the process.
