God , in his heavenly workshop, is painting a doll, only to reject it when he messes up the eyebrows. Meanwhile, three people, grieving father John , petty thief Ms. Merrywood , and the young Tamara , are all implied to have been killed, John by suicide, Ms. Merrywood in a police shootout, and Tamara by her enraged boyfriend. . Each of the three wake up in a different part of the gates of Hell, with all of them finding an envelope with their name on it that contains a ticket to the carnival. Ticket-Keeper  begins to prepare the carnival workers for the three attendees and selects several of the carnies to interact with them. The Ticket-Keeper selects the Painted Doll , the Twin , the Hobo Clown , and the Scorpion , much to the chagrin of Wick  and the Magician . Upon hearing the Magician's complaints, the Ticket-Keeper states that Lucifer would be participating in the night's events personally and that there was no need for additional carnies. The Painted Doll is then sent to look for the Scorpion, who was selected but did not appear at the meeting. John and Ms. Merrywood begin to wander closer to the main gate of the Carnival, and are welcomed by Wick, the Magician, and the Fool  . Ms. Merrywood and John meet up at the gates of the carnival, with the Ticket-Keeper taking their tickets and explaining the rules and the consequences of breaking them . After entering, Ms. Merrywood and John separate, with John searching for his son and Ms. Merrywood searching for a game that offers the chance to win a large diamond. Meanwhile, Tamara encounters the Scorpion and releases him from the cage he'd been trapped in. Tamara is instantly charmed by him and agrees to participate in his knife-wielding act. John still searches for his son, only to be taunted by Wick and her Woe-Maidens  and then assaulted by the Painted Doll after asking each of them for help. Ms. Merrywood attempts to find the booth by asking the Hobo Clown for directions, only for her to accidentally litter and get chased by the Tamer, which leads her to the Twin's game. The Twin assumes Ms. Merrywood's shape, having her play a coin-toss game for the diamond. As she loses each turn, her jewelry and clothing is stripped from her . Ms. Merrywood is later taken to one of the circus tents and whipped in front of the carnies as the Hobo Clown describes Ms. Merrywood's downfall through song . Tamara finds herself separated from the Scorpion, only to find him and the Painted Doll passionately kissing. Tamara is taken aback, but chooses to trust the Scorpion after he accuses her of lying about trusting him. The Scorpion then straps a willing Tamara to his knife-throwing wheel to participate in his act, only for his final knife to hit her square in the chest, killing her . Painted Doll then describes Tamara's demise to the carnies while retelling the story of The Scorpion and the Frog . John continually sees images of his son Daniel throughout the carnival, only to be tricked each time. He then wanders through a house of mirrors and strobe room, and finds a recreation of the bathroom where he slit his own wrists, singing of his grief for his son . John then finds Daniel sitting in a room with Lucifer , who has been reading some of Aesop's Fables to the boy. Daniel is revealed to be another trick, and John exclaims his grief for Daniel. Lucifer informs John that his son died a clean death. John screams that he wishes that Daniel was never born, to the surprise of Lucifer. John ultimately resolves his grief, and Lucifer has no choice but to release him to Heaven, much to the surprise of God. Lucifer informs Ticket-Keeper that he has let John go to Heaven, which prompts Lucifer and Ticket-Keeper to re-write the 666 Rules of the Carnival. Ticket-Keeper informs the carnies that they will prepare for a war with Heaven. Lucifer chants and reveals his grand plot to overthrow Heaven, causing God to scream in pain as he hears it . In a post-credits scene, Tamara finds Lucifer in the main carnival ring. Lost and confused, she puts her trust into Lucifer as he seduces her, endlessly repeating her own sin of easily trusting people .
