Three police officers attempt to nab a serial rapist and pursue him to a construction site. The suspect's body is found dismembered later, with his limbs and torso scattered around three different locations at the site. One of the officers, Cha-siu, had committed suicide by shooting himself. His colleagues Inspector Li and Peanut  are puzzled. The mystery also arouses the curiosity of two magazine reporters, Balm and Coffee, who start investigating the case. Meanwhile, Peanut's cousin Ada goes blind after watching the horror movie A Wicked Ghost, claiming that she saw a ghost similar to the one in the film. A supernatural writer, Blue, joins the team as well and she gives a special device to Ada to record sounds of frequency inaudible to the human ear, after Ada claims that she heard strange noises. At the same time, Balm commits suicide after encountering the ghost of the rapist; Ada kills herself in hospital; Ada's sister, Clever, attempts suicide after seeing the ghosts of twins she aborted, but is saved. The recorded sounds from the device are played at high speed and they hear a hoarse female voice calling out "Hwa Yuet-may" - the name of Peanut's great-grandmother. They learn that Hwa had caused her husband's mistress, Tift, to die a slow and painful death nearly a century ago, and the ghost of Tift seeks vengeance on Hwa's descendants. Blue, Peanut, Li, Coffee and Clever join forces to confront the ghost and get rid of her.
