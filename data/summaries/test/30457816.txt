Porky is informed that his beloved Train the 13{{frac}} named 'Toots' is to be replaced by a streamline train by the name of 'The Silver Fish'. After the driver of 'The Silver Fish' insults 'Toots', Porky mutters that his train could easily take on the streamline train. The driver agrees to a race that ends with Porky being the victor  and becoming the new driver of 'The Silver Fish' whilst a battered 'Toots' is on a trailer behind with 'Headin' for the last roundhouse' written on a sign attached to it.
