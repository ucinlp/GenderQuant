With high school behind him, Andy Hardy  decides that as an adult, it's time to start living his life. Judge Hardy  had hoped that his son would go to college and study law, but Andy isn't sure that's what he wants to do so he heads off to New York City to find a job. Too proud to accept financial help from his longtime friend Betsy Booth , he at least lets her drive him to the city. Andy soon meets there another young man who has just been fired as "office boy" at a midtown firm. When Andy rushes there unannounced to apply for the vacancy, Betsy runs out of gasoline after patiently circling the congested streets for hours waiting for him to come out afterwards. Andy lands the job, and even gets to repeatedly date the office receptionist, a more worldly woman who with the office staff are amused at his naivete and sometimes clumsiness. He learns that daily expenses, including gifts and dates for his new girlfriend, quickly add up as well as mourning over the death of his new friend who dies. Andy is nearly fired after, due to drowsiness, he mixes up two outgoing letters in the office mail. Although ashamed to let his parents know of his difficulties, they hear of his circumstances from Betsy, and his father goes to bring him home. After facing these several lessons of life, Andy concludes that he may still have some growing up to do.
