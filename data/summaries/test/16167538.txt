Karthikeyan runs a Central Government authorized secret service agency under the guise of an organization that helps people arriving in Chennai. He leads a happy life with his wife, daughter and younger brother Surya, a mute. Surya falls in love with Anuradha, a woman that Karthikeyan brings home from the railway station but her past forces her to reject his romance. When the Governor's daughter-in-law dies, Karthikeyan finds out that it was a murder and arrests the Governor's son. Though the Governor outwardly congratulates Karthikeyan and even appoints him as his personal bodyguard, he is in fact plotting his revenge on him.
