Lori is an unhappy 15/16-year-old girl who lives with her single mother. She receives sexual attention from men, including her boss at a retail store and her mothers' boyfriend Gary. Eric Komenko  is an 18-year-old boy who has killed his parents. Incarcerated, Komenko frequently gets visits from Lt. Cristofuoro , the detective who arrested him. Cristofuoro is convinced Komenko is a psychopath, that he killed two teenage girls previously, and that he will kill again. After Eric is released from the juvenile detention facility, he lives with his aunt. His release attracts some media attention, which leads Lori to seek out Eric at his home. Lori gets in the back of Eric's car to seek shelter from rain, and she falls asleep. When Eric leaves for the weekend to meet another girl at an amusement park, Lori pops up from under a blanket while Eric is driving. The scare and near accident which follows cause a bit of a situation with the police. Reluctantly, Eric allows Lori to continue the journey with him. She tells him she saw him kiss a girl down by a river shortly before he murdered his parents. Eric realizes she saw him with the girl he choked to death in his first, unsolved murder, and attempts to kill Lori several times. Each time he is thwarted, either by Lori or by other circumstances. At the amusement park, it is revealed that Maria, the girl Eric was to meet, was bait by Cristofuoro in a plot to find Eric in order to trap him before he repeats his past mistakes. Lori warns him of the trap before he harms Maria. Because Cristofuoro cannot charge Eric with a crime, Eric is released and Lori is warned of Eric's nature. When Eric and Lori make a boat trip, Lori commits suicide by allowing herself to fall into the water although she is unable to swim. Eric tries to save her, but to no avail. Eric is then seen in the custody of a penitentiary in Cristofuoro's presence. Although the detective admits to believing Eric's explanation, Cristofuoro explains that Eric belongs in prison and expects Lori's death will provide enough reason to keep Eric imprisoned. In the end, it is revealed that Lori saw Eric put the dead girl in the river.
