The film is set in 1987,Three Twisty Delights, TIME, 18 May 2007 one of the last years of the Ceauşescu regime. When Găbiţa becomes pregnant, the two girls arrange a meeting with Mr. Bebe  in a hotel, where he is to perform an illegal abortion . At the college dorm Găbiţa and Otilia review the items they need for the day, and as Găbiţa nervously sits and waits in the room, Otilia barters and buys soap, cigarettes, etc. from school friends. Afterwards, Otilia takes a bus to visit her boyfriend Adi, from whom she borrows money. Adi asks Otilia to visit his family that night, as it is his mother's birthday, and to buy flowers on the way, to which Otilia initially declines, but she relents after Adi becomes upset. Otilia heads to a hotel where Găbiţa has booked a room, only to be informed by an unfriendly receptionist that there is no reservation under Găbiţa's last name. Otilia goes to another hotel, and after much begging and haggling is able to book a room at an expensive rate. Afterwards Otilia goes to a rendezvous point to meet with Mr. Bebe, although he had asked Găbiţa that she meet him and no one else. Mr. Bebe grows angry upon hearing that Găbiţa is not at the planned hotel. Mr. Bebe discovers that Găbiţa's claim that her pregnancy was in its third month is a lie; in fact, it has been at least four months. The two women were certain that they would pay no more than 3000 lei for the abortion. However, it slowly becomes clear to the women that he expects both women to have sex with him. Otilia reluctantly has sex with Mr. Bebe so that he will not walk out on them, and eventually Găbiţa does as well. Mr. Bebe then performs the abortion by injecting a probe and an unnamed fluid into Găbiţa's uterus, and leaves Otilia instructions on how to dispose of the fetus when it comes out. Otilia is exasperated by Găbiţa's lies, yet continues to help her and care for her. Otilia leaves Găbiţa at the hotel to go to Adi's mother's birthday. She is still disturbed but stays and has dinner with Adi's mother's friends, who are mostly doctors. They all talk about trivial things while Otilia and Adi remain silent. The phone rings in the background, but no one answers it. One of the guests then starts talking about lost values and respect to elders when Otilia accepts a cigarette offered to her in front of Adi's parents, which prompts Adi to bring the champagne in order to get the party over with. Adi and Otilia then go to his room where Otilia tells him about Găbiţa's abortion, and they start talking about what would happen if it was Otilia who was pregnant since Adi seems to be against abortion. After fighting with Adi, Otilia calls Găbiţa from Adi's house. Găbiţa does not answer, so Otilia decides to go back to Găbiţa. When Otilia enters the room Găbiţa is lying on the bed, and she tells Otilia that the fetus has come out and is in the bathroom. Otilia then wraps the fetus with some towels and puts everything in a bag, while Găbiţa asks her to bury the fetus. Otilia then goes outside and walks around for a while, finally climbing to the top of a random building, as Mr. Bebe had suggested, and dropping the bag in a trash chute. Otilia then goes back to the hotel and finds Găbiţa sitting at the restaurant. She sits and tells Găbiţa that they are never going to talk about the episode ever again. In the film's closing moment, Otilia looks at the camera, leaving the audience to decide what will happen to the two friends.
