Six years after being jailed for killing Trife, Sam is released from prison. Sam goes to visit his old girlfriend, Claire, but discovers that she has a new boyfriend, Hayden. Sam later meets a man, who turns out to be Trife's cousin, and is attacked with a knife. Trife's cousin informs him that he will not survive the day, as many people want him dead - and will stop at nothing, even harming his family. Sam, troubled by these claims, goes to speak to Becky's cousin Lexi, hoping that she might have some information. He approaches Claire, and asks her if she's seen anyone lately. She tells him that Moony goes to the local university. Sam and Robert meet in a coffee shop, where he tells him that Becky works in a salon, however he refuses to give him Jay's number, warning that he has changed for the worse. Omen, Dabs and Blammy rob a car in broad daylight and take what they have stolen to Ike's house to sell. Jay receives a call informing him that Sam is out of prison. He goes to Ike's house, seeking help about Sam. There Andreas suggests hiring some of the teenagers to kill Sam. Dabs is called into the room and eventually agrees to do it for £6k. Jay makes it clear that the others cannot see Sam's face when the murder happens. Dabs tells Henry about the plan. Not willing to kill a man, Henry tells Dabs not to go through with it. A scuffle happens and Dabs hits Henry over the head with a brick. Later, Dabs and Blammy meet Omen and tell him about the job. Omen agrees after Dabs lies and says that the target was the one who hurt Henry. Sam and Lexi meet and Sam learns that she was gang raped years ago which led her into drug addiction. Jay meets with Moony and his girlfriend in a café and tells Robert that he could have prevented Trife's death, convincing him to help Jay track down Sam. But shortly after, Robert tells Jay that he needs to move on. Later, the teenage hit-men see Sam walking through a park and tackle him to the ground. With his face to the floor, Dabs tells Omen to stab him but Omen insists on seeing his face first. It is revealed that Omen is Sam's brother. He refuses to kill his own brother and realises that Dabs knew who it was. Sam punches Dab and leaves with the two teenagers. Meanwhile, Jay goes round to Lexi's flat and we find out he is her dealer, and that Lexi was setting up Sam by bringing him back to her flat. Sam phones the man he spoke to outside prison and asks for a favor. Sam walks down a street and mugs a couple at gunpoint. He uses the stolen phone to call the police about an armed robbery, telling them the criminal is going into the house he is about to enter. Using the items he stole, he goes into Ike's house pretending to want to sell them. Meanwhile, Sam's contact phones Curtis and tells him where Sam is. While Sam is holding them all at gun point, the armed police show up and arrest Ike, Andreas, and Curtis, but Sam escapes. On the way home, Sam is attacked by Jay. Jay holds him at gunpoint and a fight ensues but during the fight Sam realises that Jay is just like he was six years ago and cannot bring himself to commit murder. Safe in the knowledge that Jay is not really dangerous, he leaves the fight.
