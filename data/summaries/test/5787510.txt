"Vinod, a 13-year-old, Kashmiri Pandit, is the sole survivor of a terrorist massacre that leaves his entire family and 20 others dead. Shiban Lal, the Divisional Commissioner of Srinagar, is forced to take Vinod home, since the child has no one to look after him. When the government announces a grant of Rs. 4,000,000 for the boy's education, an uncle turns up to collect him. The uncle finds a profitable use for Vinod - as a crowd puller during the elections. Tormented by his uncle and aunt, Vinod eventually runs away and lands up at Shiban Lal's house. When Lal talks of legally adopting Vinod, all hell breaks loose at his home, with his wife and children against the idea. Lal regretfully takes Vinod to the Border Security Force's boarding school, so that he can learn to defend himself." http://www.nfdcindia.com/view_film.php?film_id4 NFDC website
