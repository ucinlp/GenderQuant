Ranjit Mullick is a smart personable young man. A friend of the family, who works in a foreign firm, has assured him of a lucrative job in his firm. All Ranjit has to do is to appear in an interview, dressed in a western style suit. It seems a simple task, but fate wills otherwise. A strike by a labour Union means that he can't get his suit back from the laundry. His father's old suit won't fit him. He borrows a suit but loses it in a fracas. Ultimately he has to go to the interview dressed in the traditional Bengali Dhoti and Kurta . This film is considered to be the first film of Mrinal Sen's Calcutta trilogy, the others being Calcutta 71, and Padatik.
