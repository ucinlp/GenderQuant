Nearing the end of a solo self-promotional cross-country road trip from New York to San Francisco, Windy Riley ends up in Hollywood by mistake due to an inadvertently turned-around sign. His car is repossessed, but the repo man gets into a car accident with a movie mogul. The repo man blames Windy, and as Windy has no money, the mogul puts him to work in his studio's publicity department. The studio's star actress, Betty Grey , has been warned that her contract will be terminated if she gets any more bad publicity. Unaware of this, Windy kidnaps Betty's director, LaRoss, and hides him in a railroad boxcar, intending to reap some publicity . A reporter learns that LaRoss is missing and prepares to splash the news across the front page. Windy retrieves LaRoss, who then gives the reporter a different story to print - that he and Betty are getting married. Windy goes back to New York.
