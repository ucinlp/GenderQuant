The film follows the adventures of El Superbeasto , a suave, yet violent exploitation film director/actor and former masked wrestler, and his sultry "sidekick" and sister, the super-agent Suzi-X  as they prevent the evil Dr. Satan  from taking over the world by marrying the foul-mouthed stripper Velvet Von Black  with the mark of the devil on her backside. The adventure, set in the mythic world of Monsterland, also features Murray the Robot  Suzi-Xs sidekick and vehicle, based on the robot in The Phantom Creeps starring BÃ©la Lugosi.THE HAUNTED WORLD OF EL SUPERBEASTO Director Rob Zombie also references several other films. Tom Papa, writer and the voice of the titular character, incorporated his style of humor to his character. Throughout the film, El Superbeasto often makes observations in unusual moments, like Papa does in his stand-ups.
