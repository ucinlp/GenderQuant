Scotland Yard Detective Frank Webber  escorts his girlfriend Alice White  to a tea house. They have an argument and Alice leaves with Mr. Crewe , an artist whom she has earlier agreed to meet. At his studio, Crewe sings and plays "Miss Up-to-Date" on the piano, and shows her a painting of a laughing clown. Alice innocently flirts with the artist. He convinces her to try on a dress, then attempts to rape her as she is changing. Alice grabs a nearby bread knife and stabs him to death. Alice leaves after attempting to conceal any evidence of her presence in the flat. She has, however, unknowingly left her gloves behind. The next day Frank is assigned to the case and finds one of the gloves. He realizes the glove belongs to Alice and visits Alice at her father's shop. Local petty thief Tracy , who saw Alice at the artist's flat earlier, interrupts the two and attempts to blackmail the couple. Frank tells Tracy his attempt will fail. The tables are turned when Tracey becomes the chief suspect after the artist's landlady identifies him as being at the scene of the crime. Tracy flees and is pursued by the police. He clambers onto the domed roof of the British Museum Reading Room and is killed after falling through a glass panel of the dome. Alice feels compelled to confess that she killed the artist and goes to Scotland Yard. She attempts to talk to the Chief Inspector, but is escorted out by Frank. As they leave, Crewe's painting showing the laughing clown is carried past them.
