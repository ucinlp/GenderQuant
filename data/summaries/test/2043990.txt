Secret agent WD-40 Dick Steele  has his work cut out for him. Along with the mysterious and lovely Veronique Ukrinsky, Agent 3.14, he must rescue the kidnapped Barbara Dahl and stop the evil genius, a General named Rancor , from seizing control of the entire world. Rancor was wounded in an earlier encounter and no longer has arms. However, he can "arm" himself by attaching robotic limbs with various weapons attached. Steele is talked out of retirement by an old friend, agent Steven Bishop, and given his new assignment by The Director , who also is testing out a new variety of disguises. At headquarters, Steele encounters an old agency nemesis, Norm Coleman , and flirts with the Director's adoring secretary, referred to as Miss Cheevus . On the job, Steele is assisted by an agent named Kabul , who gives him rides in a never-ending variety of specially designed cars. They seek help from McLuckey , a blond child, home alone, who is very good at fending off intruders. Steele resists the temptations of a dangerous woman  he finds waiting for him in bed. But he does work very closely with Agent 3.14 , whose father, Professor Ukrinsky , is also being held captive by Rancor. Everything comes to an explosive conclusion at the General's remote fortress, where Steele rescues both Barbara Dahl  and Miss Cheevus and launches a literally disarmed Rancor into outer space, saving mankind.
