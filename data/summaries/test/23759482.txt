 Ali , a possessed workaholic writer, is spiralling downwards into a permanent state of mental corrosion, in his ill-conceived insomniac efforts to complete his latest book of fiction. On one fateful night, his overactive imagination gets the better of him. Characters and episodes from his unfinished book come to life in front of his weary eyes. They get strangely intertwined with people and experiences from his own life, resulting in absurd, tragic comedy. Tormented and chased by seductive assassins, loony psychiatrists, bullies and army men, he has only one person who can actually save him, and she too seems reluctant. {{-}}
