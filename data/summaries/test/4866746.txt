The film, spanning years, centers on two Chinese mainlanders who migrate to Hong Kong to make a living, but end up falling in love. Leon Lai plays a naive Northerner, Li Xiao-Jun, and Maggie Cheung plays an opportunist/entrepreneur from Cantonese speaking Guangzhou, Li Qiao, who takes advantage of mainlanders like herself for financial gains. The loneliness of living in the big city inevitably brings the two into a passionate love affair. But their different ambitions  mean that they are unable to be together. Eventually, Li Xiao-Jun marries his fiance  in Hong Kong and Li Qiao winds up in a relationship with a mob boss named Pao . Li Qiao also becomes a successful entrepreneur, achieving her Hong Kong dream. Despite their seemingly separate lives, however, they are still in love and they have one final tryst in the room they used to share. Burdened by guilt and his love for Li Qiao, Xiao-Jun confesses to his wife that he has not been faithful. He then leaves Hong Kong, and becomes a cook in the United States. Pao, chased by the Hong Kong police, escapes with Li Qiao to the US as illegal immigrants. After almost 10 years, Xiao-Jun and Li Qiao meet again as lonely immigrants in the US . By then, both of them have already been freed from the burden of their other lovers - Xiao-Jun's wife is left behind in Hong Kong, and Pao is killed in a robbery in the US. The film ends with Xiao-Jun and Li Qiao recognizing each other in front of a shop display TV playing a Teresa Teng video, after news of the singer's death in Thailand broke. It was filmed in Hong Kong and New York City.
