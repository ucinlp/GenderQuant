"Radio", a 23 year old mentally disabled young man, pushes a shopping cart along the streets. He is attracted by a high school football team, but after the team's coach  - taking pity on Radio, both for his disability and his enthusiasm - asks him to help, the team members abuse Radio by locking him into a shed. The team's coach reprimands them, and delivers Radio to his house, where Radio's mother is introduced. It is also revealed that Radio's father passed away a few years before. Coach Jones begins to spend more and more time with Radio, which worries the fathers of many of the team members. Concerned, one of the fathers, Frank, suggests that the coach stop associating with Radio, as he views the boy as merely a distraction to his own son's success. Coach Jones is resistant, and it is later discovered that this resistance was partially induced by an earlier incident during his childhood in which the Coach did not do anything to help a mentally retarded boy who was locked under a house. Radio eventually begins schooling in the high school, and it is apparent that he never completed formal schooling. After struggling, Radio eventually learns to read. While at school, Radio is also bullied by Johnny, the son of Frank, and tricked into entering the girls locker room, among other things. However, after Radio refuses to tell the administration who told him to do it, Johnny gains respect for Radio, and begins to doubt his father's impressions about Radio. After distributing Christmas presents to nearly everyone in the town, Radio is mistakenly arrested after a police officer believes that Radio stole the presents, when in fact they were presents given to Radio by the townspeople. However, the officer doesn't know this at the time, and roughly jails Radio. The mistake is eventually righted, but amidst the confusion, Radio's mother also suddenly dies. Even with this immense trauma, Radio is still able to "graduate" from eleventh grade, mainly because of the help and support from so many who had been kind to him after he was kind to them. The film ends with clips of the the real Radio who is now in his 60s - "the oldest eleventh grader at Hanna High."
