In 2003, seven children had aspirations for their futures. Revisiting the neighbourhood and the children eight years later, L’Est pour toujours documents the progress they have made in their lives. Marianne Racine reconnected with his father, only to find he lives in Vancouver and does not speak French. Maxime Desjardins-Tremblay has combined work and study as a film and television actor. Though wishing to become a rapper, he still gets caught up in problems with street gangs. Proulx-Roy and Jean-Roch Beauregard, having spent time in youth centers and reform schools, are both still seeking their paths in life. Valérie Allard has aspirations of working with others through social services. Samantha Goyer has completed school. At 21, Vanessa Dumont is the oldest of the seven. She looks far younger than her biological age, but this affects her search for both job and boyfriend, and she deals with dark moods. The film shares how a person's future is not always determined by where they grew up.
