 Alice clones  attempt to kill Albert Wesker  at his base in Tokyo. Wesker escapes and destroys the base, killing all of the clones. However, the real Alice boarded his aircraft beforehand. Wesker uses a serum to remove all of Alice's powers before the lack of a pilot makes the aircraft crash. Alice somehow survives the crash while Wesker seemingly perishes. Six months later, Alice travels back to North America in an airplane following emergency broadcasts from a safe haven known as Arcadia in Alaska . En route to Alaska, Alice is attacked by Claire Redfield ; after the attack, Alice destroys the device controlling Claire  and discovers Claire has amnesia. The two travel to the ruins of Los Angeles in a Yak-52 plane, where they find a group of survivors living in a prison surrounded by the infected. Luther West , leads the small band which includes Wendell , Crystal Waters , Bennett  and Kim Yong , Angel Ortiz , and Chris Redfield , who is a prisoner under lockdown in the facility. With their help, Alice lands her plane on the roof of the prison and learns that Arcadia is not a fixed place but actually a cargo tanker traveling along the coast. Alice and the survivors decide to find an alternate means to make it to the Arcadia. Chris reveals he's Claire's brother, insisting he is not a prisoner but actually a soldier who fell victim to a cruel joke by some escaped prisoners; he claims to know an alternate route. While in the shower, Alice is attacked by a group of Majini infected that managed to tunnel into the prison. Wendell, who was trying to peep on Alice, is taken away/eaten by the zombies. Alice, seeing as they are out of options, decides to set Chris free and leave the prison. Chris reveals that the prison keeps an armored car that can be used to escape. However, a giant axe-wielding monster begins breaking down the gate outside. To overcome the problems, Alice, Chris and Crystal go deeper into the prison to retrieve additional guns from the armory; Luther and Claire attempt to reinforce the gate to keep the Axeman and other zombies at bay. As Alice, Chris and Crystal make it to the armory, zombies swarm them, overpowering and devouring Crystal. Angel informs Bennett and Yong that the vehicle is missing its engine and it would take a week to fix. Panicking, Bennett shoots Angel, abandons Yong, and escapes with Alice's airplane. Below, the Axeman finally breaks down the gate, allowing the zombies outside to enter the facility. With no other choice, the group decides to use the zombie-dug tunnels to escape into the sewers. Yong is suddenly cut in half by the Axeman, whom Alice and Claire then face. Alice attempts to fight it first and it knocks her out; Claire then defends Alice and just before it kills her, Alice awakes and saves them both. The two meet back up with Chris at the end of the sewers but they lose Luther to a zombie who drags him back into the sewers. Alice and the Redfields commandeer a boat and board the Arcadia, discovering it's functional but abandoned. Claire suddenly regains her memory, and reveals Arcadia was an Umbrella trap to gather survivors to be used as test subjects. The trio begin releasing survivors, among them K-Mart . Seeing a trail of blood leading from an empty test subject container, Alice follows it deeper into the ship. As she expected, Alice finds Wesker, brought back by the T-virus. However, Wesker is constantly battling the virus for control of his body, something he believes could be pacified by fresh human DNA; the Umbrella staff fled Arcadia in terror. Wesker reveals he plans to eat Alice, the only person to bond at a cellular level with the T-virus and successfully retain control, hoping it will give him the control he needs. Chris and Claire arrive and attack Wesker while Alice battles two dogs and Bennett, who has allied himself with Wesker. Wesker easily overpowers Chris and Claire, but Alice is able to defeat both Bennett and Wesker with help from K-Mart. While leaving, they lock Bennett in the room with Wesker's corpse; Bennett is devoured by Wesker when he revives. Wesker then escapes in an aircraft, activating a bomb on the Arcadia. The plane explodes instead; Alice placed the bomb there, thinking it might be set off. Unbeknownst to them, a figure parachutes away from the explosion, while Luther emerges from the sewers, battered but alive. Alice resolves to turn Arcadia into a real safe haven and broadcasts a new message for any other survivors. Claire, Chris, K-Mart, and Alice soon see an approaching Umbrella assault helicopter squadron. During the post-credits scene in one of the helicopters, Jill Valentine , who went missing after Resident Evil: Apocalypse, is dictating the attack wearing the same mind control device used on Claire,End credits. which slightly glows at the end of the scene, thus setting up the events of Resident Evil: Retribution.
