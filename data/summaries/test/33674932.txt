On some poor, but well-meaning advice from Mabel’s best friend, Anna , Mabel buys Mariella’s red bag at Anna’s store in a fit of retail therapy.

At a loss at what to do, Anna suggests more retail therapy. As Mabel tries on a dress, Mariella makes her presence felt to Mabel inside the dressing room. Before Mabel could get out of her dress, Dindo calls Anna and Mabel to review CCTV footage that shows Mariella passing through a solid wooden door and following Mabel. Upon closer inspection, Mabel notices that the dress she tried on earlier, which she is still wearing, is the same dress as that on Mariella in her apparitions. Freaked out, the bag and the dress go into the trash bin at the mall entrance. Samantha has been trying to seduce Ivan, after hinting at a one night stand on the date Mariella disappeared, but Ivan refuses her advances.

At the antique shop, Dindo tries to convince Mabel to leave Ivan, saying he is there to protect Mabel from Mariella. As Dindo leaves, Mabel notices that a dresser is vibrating. A large mirror on the dresser shatters after a Mariella apparition, and Mabel is drenched.
