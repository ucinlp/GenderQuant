The Movie From the Future is a movie within a movie. The set-up is you are watching an Unsolved Mysteries type program about a video tape found in a crater with a note reading "From Future." Most of the movie consists of the contents of the tape with various experts breaking in to offer their opinions on the validity of the tape or whether it is a hoax. The contents of the tape seem to be a made-for-television feature from the future about inter-species love, futuritistic inventors, and plans to destroy the world by aliens and the robots attempting to thwart them.
