The film tells the story of Clemente, a moneylender of few words, who might be a new hope for Sofía, his single neighbor. She is a devoted worshiper of Our Lord of the Miracles, a traditional religious image. They're brought together over a new-born baby, fruit of Clemente's relationship with a prostitute who's nowhere to be found. While Clemente is looking for the girl's mother, Sofía cares for the baby and looks after the moneylender's house. With the arrival of these beings in his life, Clemente has the opportunity to reconsider his emotional relations with people.
