Jillian "Jill" Conway  lives in Portland, Oregon with her sister Molly , a college student. Jill was kidnapped by a brutal serial killer who put her in a deep vertical hole somewhere in Portland's 5000 acre Forest Park. Jill finds human remains, using a bone to stab her abductor and escape from the hole using his rope ladder. When the Portland police are unable to find the hole, and discover that Jill had been committed to a psychiatric institution after her parents' death, they believe the abduction only happened in Jill's head, sending Jill back to a psychiatric facility. It is a year later and Jill now works as a waitress. She and her friend Sharon Ames  are generously tipped by a regular customer. Returning home from working the graveyard shift, Jill is shocked that Molly is missing. Molly's boyfriend, Billy , tells her that he hasn't heard from Molly, and that she didn't show up for an important exam. Jill becomes convinced that the serial killer who took her has now taken Molly. Police Lt. Ray Bozeman , Sergeant Powers , and Detective Erica Lonsdale  dismiss her claims, trying to look for any other excuse for Molly to be missing, believing that it's all in Jill's head. The department's newest homicide detective, Peter Hood  tells her that he believes her, giving Jill his card in case she needs help. Jill interrogates her neighbors and learns that a van with a locksmith company's name on it parked in front of her house in the middle of the night. Jill finds the company it belongs to and talks to owner Henry Massey  and the van's driver, Massey's son Nick . When Nick denys any knowledge, Jill breaks into the van, where she finds a receipt from a hardware store for things that the killer would use. Jill holds Nick at gunpoint and forces him to reveal that he allowed a stranger named "Digger" to rent the van during the night. Nick reports Jill's gun waving behaviour to the police, who plan to arrest Jill, as her time in the psychiatric facility means she can not get a gun permit. Jill goes to the hardware store, and learns that Digger's real name is Jim McCoy , and that he's staying at a rundown hotel. After narrowly eluding the police, Jill heads to the hotel, and breaks into McCoy's room, where she finds duct tape, pet food like that which she was given by her kidnapper, and matches from the diner where she works. Jill visits Sharon, and learns that McCoy is the generous tipper from the diner. Sharon gives Jill his phone number and &ndash; after another narrow escape from the police &ndash; agrees to let Jill borrow her car. Jill then calls McCoy, who gives her directions to a location in Forest Park. Jill locates a small campsite and finds pictures of McCoy's victims, and at the same time, Molly breaks the duct tape off of her hands, and escapes...from under her and Jill's house. Powers and Lonsdale are shocked when they hear Molly's story, finally believing what they have heard from Jill. Jill finds the hole where McCoy held her captive. McCoy emerges from nearby and throws Jill down the hole, intending to kill her with a knife he carved out of the piece of bone that Jill used to escape. Jill draws her gun and shoots him, climbs up then extracts the rope ladder, trapping McCoy in the hole. McCoy admits that Molly has been bound and gagged under their house the whole time, and he only used Molly to lure Jill into a trap. Jill pours a can of kerosene into the hole and lights it, burning McCoy to death. Jill arrives home, finding Molly, Powers and Lonsdale. She whispers to Molly that McCoy is dead, then sarcastically tells the police that everything was in her imagination. Some time later, Bozeman is in his office when he receives an anonymous package. Inside are pictures McCoy had taken of each of his victims, bound and gagged in the hole, including Jill herself. A map indicates the spot in Forest Park where the police can find the hole. Realizing how wrong he was about Jill, Bozeman calls Powers into his office to reopen the case so they can investigate the hole and McCoy's campsite.
