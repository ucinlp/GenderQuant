A live-action hand draws a strip of  film, which takes the form of a human head, who uses musical notes to form a body. Then he sings notes that form a xylophone. Then, he performs a short solo, until another piece of film  jumps on him. The talking strip yells, "Hey, Mute! What's the big idea, ruining my act?" The silent strip uses sign language, with subtitles above, asking him about his voice's origin. He talks about a man named "Dr. Western" that gave him "a set of vocal cords", saying he needs to see him, too. They go to his office, with "Talkie" telling him to put "'Mutie' through the 'works'." They go to a filming set, where Talkie performs a song named, "Just a Song at Twilight". Then, Dr. Western explains every step of the Western Electric process of sound recording, and Mutie finally earn his voice, as Talkie was performing his song. He jumps onto stage and disrupts his solo. He asks him to calm down, and they perform "Good Night, Ladies" and "Merrily We Roll Along" as they sail on a boat, with an awkward ending of a whale eating the boat and an advertisement for Western Electric.
