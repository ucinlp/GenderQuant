The film takes place at the beginning of summer and follows three girls through a summer that will change their lives. The story is told by Keira St. George , a girl who is trying to decide what to do with her life. She constantly throws away her college letter without reading it, but her father always retrieves it, annoying her more. Her two best friends are Glory Lorraine  a beautiful but somewhat bitchy girl obsessed with marriage, and Lisa MacDougall , an awkward, born-again, religious girl who is obsessed with sex. Glory constantly "babysits" for Keith Clark  and his wife, who works the night shift a few times a week. Keith is a 32-year-old husband and father, who loves to ride his motorcycle, gamble with friends and smoke a lot of pot. One afternoon, Keira talks to Gordon Gruber , who is a bit slow and somewhat mentally disabled, trying to get information from him about Keith, who has taken Gruber under his wing. Gruber tells Keira about the pot growing in Keith's backyard. That night, Keira and Lisa decide to take some of Keith's pot. While leaving, they hear what sounds like Keith and his wife having sex. Sex crazed Lisa decides to take a closer look. When Kiera joins her, the two discover that Keith isn't with his wife - he's with Glory! Later that night, Glory arrives at the bonfire. After much giggling and teasing, Keira and Lisa tell Glory about seeing her with Keith. Glory defends her actions, saying she loves Keith and he loves her. The next day, while Keira works at the food stand, Glory tells her more about Keith and her relationship with him. Wheels begin to turn in Keira's head, and after debating with herself, she decides to go to Keith's. He answers the door and Keira tells him she's a friend of Glory's. He thinks she wants to buy pot, but she tells him she will "babysit" too. She convinces him to let her in, where she makes it clear that she wants to sleep with him. He tells her he's married and she's half his age, but it is obvious both are attracted to each other. She leads Keith into the bedroom. The next day, Lisa arrives at the stand to tell Keira that she's going to sleep with Keith Clark. Keira doesn't like this and tells Lisa that she's supposed to be religious and wait until she's married and that she will hurt Glory, but according to Lisa, since she hasn't been baptized yet, it's okay. She is concerned that when she marries, her virgin husband will not be satisfying. Not heeding Keira's repeated warnings, Lisa continues with her plan and takes off for Keith's house. When she arrives, Keith is out in the garden. It is an awkward conversation in which Lisa makes it abundantly clear that she wants to "babysit" too. Glory arrives and is angry at Lisa and hostile to the others. While Keith goes inside to tend to his crying daughter, Glory takes the opportunity to yell at Lisa for what she is doing. Eventually, Glory tells Keith that she will be unable to babysit because her mother needs her to go to a meeting. He tries to get her to reconsider, but Lisa promptly proclaims that she will babysit. Glory tries to stop it but finally Keith is left having to agree. While babysitting, Lisa calls Keira to tell her she's at Keith's house. Keira again begs her not to follow through with her plan. This angers Lisa, who wanted Keira to come over and support her before Keith arrives home but eventually hangs up on her. Keith arrives home and Lisa quickly jumps him in an attempt to have sex. Lisa even says that it's okay with Glory. Keith, obviously weirded out, keeps coming up with excuses not to but eventually agrees to help Lisa lose her virginity. Keira and Glory arrive outside, with Glory obviously angry, and decide to look through the bedroom window. Keith and Lisa are trying to have sex, though it is awkward. Outside, Keira admits to Glory that she also slept with Keith and Glory punches her, making her nose bleed. Glory is even more furious and eventually storms into the house and into the bedroom. An argument ensues between the girls and eventually all three leave. Glory refuses to talk to her best friends, giving them the finger as she rides back and forth past them on her bike. She rides over to Keith's house, trying to work things out, but Keith tells her it would be best if they stop seeing each other. She is heartbroken, professing again that she loves him, but he doesn't budge on his stance. Glory is understandably hurt and refuses to get up the next morning, only answering Keira's call because of her mother's threat. She joins Lisa and Keira in Keira's bedroom where she tells Glory about the plan. Keira and Lisa decided that since all three girls want Keith, then they should share him. Using a calendar, Keira explains that with Sue, Keith's wife, working four night shifts, each girl could have him for a night and they could all hang out the other night. While explaining the plan to Keith, he balks at the proposal. Keira threatens him with the fact that if people somehow find out, he will be considered a "pervert pothead who molests young girls". Backed into a corner, Keith agrees. The night after night sessions with the girls take a toll on Keith, who cannot seem to stay awake anymore and, has performance problems and is upset that he hasn't been intimate with his wife and has a responsibility to his family. Eventually, Keith is upset when the girls almost tip off his wife and is hostile to the girls, saying he won't continue, but Keira restates her threat. Later, the girls get scared when Lenny , a biker friend of Keith's, arrives. Keith confides in them that he has a bit of a problem with Lenny and he's been threatened. The girls hide in the baby's room as Lenny begins to beat up Keith. As it turns out, Keith and Lenny plotted this in order to scare the girls away but it backfires when the girls eventually take the baby and run, thinking they all might be in danger. Keith is startled when he finds Gruber in the basement, telling him he can use the front door. Gruber tells Keith he has seen what Keith has been doing with the girls and knows about Keith and Lenny's plan. This does not intimidate Keith. When he realizes his daughter has been taken, Keith freaks out and takes off to find them. At the dock, he grabs Lisa hard, screaming at her to tell him where his daughter is. This causes Gruber to knock Keith out with a tire iron. Donny  arrives at the scene following Gruber who took off with his  tire iron. All five of the teens take Jasmine and the unconscious and bleeding Keith back home and debate whether to call 911 but Keira hangs up the phone when Keith awakes. Gruber admits to the girls that Keith tricked them, making the extremely mad. Keith doesn't care, telling them that he's sick of it all. Meanwhile, a colleague at the hospital tells Sue that there was a hang up call to 911 from her house. Sue leaves to investigate. Back at Keith's, things get crazy and Glory again professes her love to Keith but Keith rejects her telling her that she was crazy to think he would leave with her. She tells him that she's pregnant, shocking everyone. The teens all begin to disperse, many with curfews. Donny drives Glory, Gruber and Lisa home. As Glory sits crying, Donny, who cares for her, holds her and comforts her. Keith's wife returns home, shocked at the mess and her husband's injury. Keith lies to her, telling her it was Lenny, not thinking she will call the police. She does, however, which leads Lenny to punch him out. Lisa leaves for her religious boarding school where she still seems to be freaky. Donny and Glory eventually begin to date and he cares for the pregnant girl. Keira ends up going to college and knows she's going to enjoy it...   *David Boreanaz as Keith Clark *Caroline Dhavernas as Keira St-George *Holly Lewis as Lisa MacDougall *Amanda Walsh as Glory Lorraine *Colin C.
