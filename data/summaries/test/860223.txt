Little Red  goes out on Christmas Eve to buy some drugs on the dangerous streets, aptly named "The Forest". She is caught with a joint by a crooked police officer, "Wolfy" , who seems more interested in molesting Red than making the arrest. When some careless tourists snap photos of Wolfy's lewd behavior, he is forced to shoot them, then eats Red, the only witness. Meanwhile, Red's father, Black Santa , goes out to steal some presents from rich families. He happens to break into Wolfy's house, and ends up having sex with his wife. Wolfy comes home to find his wife with Santa, and shoots her. Santa manages to grab a gun from above the fireplace and shoots Wolfy. Hearing Red's voice coming from inside Wolfy's body, Santa tears open Wolfy's body to find his daughter safe, although shaken. Later in the evening, Red and her family sing carols around the Christmas tree, which is now topped by a star, Wolfy's police badge. The film is notable for being shamelessly over the top, including entirely gratuitous nudity, excessive violence, and bright garish colours throughout. It begins with a dramatic but entirely unnecessary overhead crane shot. Channel 4 introduced this short film noting it was almost the antithesis of the minimalism Dogme 95 school of filmmaking.
