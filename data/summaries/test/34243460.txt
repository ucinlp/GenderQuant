Budget Padmanabham  is about a miser who will do anything to save money. He eats only one meal a day, and won't do anything that will involvespending. If he gives a lift to his colleagues he collects money from them. You wouldn't consider him to be one of those persons you would give an arm and a leg to associate with, but, strangely, Ramya  not only likes him, she also falls deeply in love with him.Padmanabham doesn't want to do anything with her, but when Ramya suggests that two salaries are better than one, he thinks it's a brilliant idea and marries her. So much for the institution. Now start the troubles: first, his sister Vijaya and her husband Vaastu Subramanyam L.B. Sriram pile on to him,and then Ramya's good-for-nothing brother Ravi  also seeks shelter in their house. The worst, though, is yet to come for the grumbling Padmanabham: his wife gives birth to triplets.
