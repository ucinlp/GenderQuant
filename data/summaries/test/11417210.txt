Jerry, a secret agent, drives through the street of a city  and enters his secret headquarters through a cigar store Indian. His mission: infiltrate the mansion of Tom Thrush and recover a refrigerator with lots of cheese. Tom  sets some traps for Jerry, including an exploding robot female mouse. These are mostly ineffective. Tom manages to make it to the safeguarded room and sets even more traps, such as blades and sensitive mines. Jerry plays a tape-recorder; it sounds as if he is walking through the room. Tom waits a few seconds, then says "Boom!" Not hearing the explosions that should result from the walking, Tom runs in. He is attacked by his own traps. Jerry straps the refrigerator to his tiny car and Tom is crawling out the front door of his mansion, though it is obvious that, since the earlier incident, he was in a very bad way. His hand lands on the "Play" button of Jerry's tape player, and the song "Taps" starts to play. Tom grabs a flower and lays it on his chest. The words "THE END" are shown behind his number plate  as Jerry drives off.
