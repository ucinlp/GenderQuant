On the outside, Fina and Rodel's marriage is a match made in heaven; but behind the thick walls of what they call home, their relationship is on the verge of crumbling. For all their affluence, the couple's lives remains empty. Devoid of a child to call their own, any attempts they make to conceive may prove fatal to Fina  due to her medical condition. In an act of desperation, Rodel  takes matters into his own hands and seeks the services of a surrogate, Ditas. The plan goes awry when Rodel becomes genuinely attracted to the younger and more alluring Ditas ; while Ditas, whose lived a destitute life, finds the notion of prosperity equally irresistible. The well-intentioned plan to resuscitate life back into a dying marriage may become its undoing.
