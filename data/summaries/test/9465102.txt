The film follows a day in the life of Detective Chief Inspector George Gideon of the Metropolitan Police. His day starts when he received information that one of his officers has been on the take. Despite his hectic schedule, his wife reminds him his daughter has a violin recital that evening; she also tells him her aunt and uncle are coming for tea before the concert. This becomes a recurring theme throughout the film, as Gideon is continually hampered in his efforts to finish work and return home. On the way to Scotland Yard he drops his daughter off at the Royal College of Music but is stopped by a young constable for running a red light. Once at his office, he calls in the detective who a snout has told him is taking bribes and suspends him. Gideon then gets word that an escaped mental patient from Manchester is on his way to London. Meanwhile an audacious gang are robbing banks. The mental patient is soon arrested but not before he killed his former landlady's daughter. Gideon personally wants to congratulate the policeman who made the arrest only to discover it's the same overzealous young officer who gave him a summons for his early morning traffic offence. Various jobs then pre-occupy the chief inspector while his detectives continue to investigate the bribery case. News then arrives the suspended policeman has been run down by a car; a vehicle that fits the description of one used in the earlier bank jobs. After visiting the dead officer's wife, evidence soon emerges that links the dead detective to a woman who went to clubs he frequented. Gideon goes to the address and discovers that the woman's husband was responsible for the robberies because he wanted the financial means to be a painter. The husband then tricks his wife in to holding a gun on Gideon while he makes his escape. The detective uses his calm manner to diffuse the situation. But before he can return home, the phone rings again. A safety deposit firm has been robbed by a gang of rich socialites who have been cornered inside. When the police finally draw them out, Gideon catches one of the gang himself. But he loses his temper when he finds out that the elderly night watchman was killed in cold blood by the man he arrested. Telling him "you'll hang for this, you rich nobody!" Finally Gideon gets home. His wife tells him that their daughter has met a nice young man at her recital. It turns out it's the young constable again. He had been holding the chief inspector's concert ticket all day following his morning meeting. This led him to meet Gideon's daughter who is quite taken by the young man. But finally just as they are all sitting down to supper, the phone ring one last time. A man believed to be Peter the Painter has been arrested at London Airport. The film concludes with a finally irony, the young constable, who is driving Gideon to the airport, is stopped by another policeman as he races through the capital's foggy streets for running a red light!
