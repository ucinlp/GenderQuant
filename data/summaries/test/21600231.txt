Daffy Duck is a novelty gag salesman operating on the sidewalk of a large city, selling things like flower squirters, a Joe Miller joke book, a rib-tickler, a cheap chicken inspector badge  and a 200-volt electric hand buzzer, even shocking himself with the latter in the process . However, he fails to sell anything to anyone. But after hearing a radio report declaring that the mirthless buzzsaw tycoon J.P. Cubish is offering a one million dollar reward to anyone who can make him laugh  before he passes on, Daffy promptly sets off for the millionaire's home with dollar signs in his eyes. Upon arriving at Cubish's mansion, Daffy finds that the butler  is not willing to let him in. Daffy tries several ways to get inside , all of which end in failure . Daffy finally sneaks into the house by hiding in a package designed to look like a bottle of champagne . Daffy runs for his life as the butler tries to kill him with an axe and the duck tries to escape via a dumb waiter. Daffy narrowly avoids a cannon blast which destroys the dumb waiter and climbs further, only to confront the butler . As the incensed butler swears he'll get rid of Daffy permanently, the wily duck starts interrogating the butler ala Humphrey Bogart , accusing him of not wanting Cubish to return to his good health . He proceeds to accuse the astounded butler of attempted murder , eventually asiding to the audience, "Phew! What's Humphrey Bogart got that I ain't got?". Having frightened the butler into incoherence, Daffy tricks him into fleeing the house in disguise, so as not to be arrested.  At last, Daffy makes it to Cubish's bedroom, but before he can even unpack his novelty items, he slips and falls on a tray of food, covering himself in cake. To Daffy's bemused resentment , Cubish finds this sight hilarious and laughs uproariously. In the end, Cubish keeps Daffy on hand as his personal jester, merrily throwing pies at the duck's face while he stands against a target. "It's a living," Daffy asides to the audience.
