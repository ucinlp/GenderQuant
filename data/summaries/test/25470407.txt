It all begins when Liz McCann and her son, Mason, leave on a trip to visit Liz's estranged father Jack for Christmas. He gave them instructions, but they just can't seem to find the exact place. Liz was driving, and Mason suddenly tells her to stop. She thinks her son saw something, but it was just a reindeer. Mason runs deep in the forest and sees a town in the valley. He announces to his mother that they have found the place, but Liz can't get the car running. Mason assures her they can walk, it's not that far. They get there, and find out that the small town is called Hollyville. They walk by a strange factory, called "NP Enterprises". When they look through the fence, but they are interrupted by a man that tells them that there is "NO PEEKING!". Then they walk deeper in Hollyville. They find out that Jack, who was formerly a banker, is now working as a chef at the local cafe, called "The Egg Nog". They find a woman named Roxie to fix their car, and Liz hopes they will not stay for too long. Meanwhile, grandpa Jack takes them to his cottage, which has a huge Christmas tree inside. It is revealed that Liz doesn't quite like Christmas. Mason finds out that "NP Enterprises" is actually "North Pole Enterprises", and that Santa's elves work there, including the big man.
