Vicky Lane and Dan Christy get into an argument about Dan's womanizing and go separate ways. A jealous Vicky becomes involved with her old dance partner and ex-lover Victor Price. Dan's career declines after that and he misses Vicky, so he follows her to a hotel in the Canadian Rockies where she and Victor are opening a new show together. Dan goes on a boozy bender and wakes up the next morning to find that he has somehow hired a Latin secretary named Rosita Murphy. This leads Vicky to think that Dan is up to his old womanizing habits again.
