Naosuke and Tamiko are a happily married couple, and have just bought some land in the countryside to build their new house on. They ask Yanagisawa, Tamiko's junior at university and an interior designer to design it. However, because he is not a qualified architect, they need someone else to apply for consent and built it. They ask Tamiko's father, a builder, to do this. Yanagisawa is a modernist, influenced by American architecture; Tamako's father is a traditionalist. The two soon come into conflict over the design of the house. After many disagreements, they eventually start to understand each other's way of thinking. The house is successfully completed.
