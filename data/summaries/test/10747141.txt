Seven orphan cavemen grow up on a little island all by themselves. After a fire burns all the vegetation, they set out to find a new place to live. One day they trap a strange animal, looking very similar to them, only softer and with longer hair. She, Filli , is attracted to one of the brothers, Ulli , and convinces him, that a certain kind of playing with each other is far more satisfying than just eating her.
