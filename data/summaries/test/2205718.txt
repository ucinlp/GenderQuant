An unnamed man, simply called "The Man"  is trapped in a cubical white room where anyone else can enter and leave, but which he himself apparently cannot leave. A stool is brought in covered in strawberry jam, the furniture changes throughout the play. The main character, is subjected to an increasingly puzzling and frustrating series of encounters, as a variety of people come through various hidden doors. But, as many remind him, he can only leave through his own door, so he must find it to leave. He received various contradictory information and his character is often mocked or made to appear foolish through trickery. A priest gives him an orb which is supposed to hold the meaning of life but only makes a grinding noise, the man smashed it to find inexplicably it is made of strawberry jam inside. Eventually a gun is left in the room and the man attempts to shoot himself and ink squirts onto his face. All the people he had encountered enter and laugh at him. Enraged he tells them he's had enough and that no matter what happens he know  real. The man then leaves the room and is escorted into an office where he laments on the revelation of his own realness. He accidentally cuts himself with a knife while demonstrating and is asked to taste his blood. He does so and reveals his blood is "strawberry jam" the office fades away to reveal the man still trapped in the cube.
