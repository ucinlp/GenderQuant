Ramudu ([[Sunil  has tremendous love for his cousin Radha  right from his childhood. Things go wrong for him when his mother dies; his father marries another woman which he dislikes and runs away from home. He returns home  after twelve years only after his father’s death. He even accepts his brother ([[Venu Madhav  born to his step mom. Ramudu’s love for Radha remains unchanged. In fact, he returns home after so long time only to win Radha’s love and marry her. On the contrary, Radha loves another person, Raghu  who is an orphan and also jobless. Radha’s father  dislikes this; he lays a condition that he would agree for their marriage only if Raghu finds a job. Ignorant of the fact, but with good intention, Ramudu offers a job to Raghu. Later, he learns about the fact and gets despaired. In such a circumstance, Ramudu’s brother resolves to unite his brother with Radha and eliminate Ramudu’s misery. Ramudu’s brother tactfully implicates Raghu in a murder and sends him to prison. Thus he plays a spoil game in averting marriage between Radha and Raghu. In such a distressed condition, Radha’s father with no other option remaining pleads with Ramudu to marry Radha. Ramudu readily agrees and marries Radha. What happens when Radha learns about the fact later? Will she continue her married life with Ramudu or does she goes to Raghu or anything strange happens... The remaining part of the movie is based on these circumstances.
