The movie almost exclusively takes place inside a corner café, where people go and share their lives. It soon becomes obvious that the café is a "programmed reality", as the programmer makes contact with one of the inhabitants, telling him that he is an avatar and manipulating minor details of the world. In dialogues between programmer and avatar, an exchange on the nature and purpose of the simulation takes place that examines common philosophical questions on the nature of God and creation. At the end of the film, possibly hinting at the nature of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the avatar has to make a tough choice when a tragedy happens.
