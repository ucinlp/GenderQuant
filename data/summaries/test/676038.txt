Dr. Ralph Wyman  and his wife, Marian , meet another couple, Stuart and Claire Kane  at a concert and make a spontaneous Sunday dinner date, but both marriages show their cracks over the weekend. While Ralph and Marian Wyman avoid a taboo topic that is undermining their marriage, Stuart goes on a fishing trip with some buddies  and they discover a dead body in the water. Upon his return, Claire is horrified to discover that Stuart and his buddies left the girl in the water until the end of the weekend so they could continue fishing. Meanwhile, waitress Doreen Piggot , whose husband Earl  is a verbally abusive alcoholic, accidentally hits young Casey Finnigan  with her car. When the little boy walks away from the accident, she assumes he is all right, but never learns of the fatal consequences, or the harassment his parents, Howard  and Ann Finnigan , must face from the local baker  who is livid because Casey's birthday cake was never picked up. Howard's estranged father, Paul Finnigan  drops by the hospital after a 20-year absence and relates the story of his own infidelity. Doreen's daughter, Honey , is married to Bill Bush , a man aroused by sadism. Their party buddies, Lois  and Jerry Kaiser , face marital problems of their own, as Lois earns her living as a phone-sex operator, leaving Jerry  with a wife whose attitude toward sex is indifferent at best. Gene Shepard  is a corrupt cop who cheats on his wife, Sherri , and seems oblivious to the fact that his wife long ago had discovered his secretâ€”and just does not care. Gene's mistress is realtor Betty Weathers , and Sherri's ultimate confidante is Marian, her sister. These stories are woven together with musical bridges performed by Zoe , a depressed cellist, and her embittered, jazz singer mother, Tess , who live next to the Finnigans.
