An ex-Confederate Army officer  named Lassiter revenging himself against Apache Indians who have massacred his family recovers a stolen U.S. Army repeating rifle off some Apaches he has killed. The U.S. Army arrests him, offering him his freedom if he leads a small clandestine scouting unit into Mexico consisting of an Army Captain , a Buffalo Soldier sergeant , a knife wielding Mexican prisoner, and later an Apache woman warrior . After blasting their way through bandits and Apaches they discover another former Confederate  has set up a new Confederate headquarters, and is selling guns to the Apaches, including the ones who slaughtered Lassiter's family.
