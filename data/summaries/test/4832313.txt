The film begins with a recap of what happened in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs provided by the Looking Glass . Following the wicked Queen's demise, her own demon minions with the inclusion of Scowl the Owl  and Batso the Bat  celebrate that they will not have to work for her anymore. Just then, the Queen's sorcerer brother Lord Maliss  arrives at his sister's castle and finds that she is not there. Lord Maliss then threatens the Looking Glass on where his sister is, and it reveals that the Queen is no more and that Snow White is now betrothed to the Prince. An enraged Lord Maliss then takes control of the Queen's castle and minions, twists the land into the Realm of Doom, and vows that Snow White will pay for his sister's death. He then transforms into a dragon and flies off with Scowl and Batso not far behind. Snow White  and the Prince (voiced by [[Michael Horton  are riding the Prince's horse to the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs to visit them. When the Prince is kidnapped by Lord Malice with Scowl nearly messing up his mission to capture him, Snow White flees to the Seven Dwarfs' cottage and collapses upon exhaustion. When she wakes up, she meets their female cousins the Seven "Dwarfelles" Muddy , Sunburn , Blossom , Marina , Critterina , Moonbeam , and Thunderella . The Dwarfelles inform Snow White that the Seven Dwarfs opened up a mine in the next kingdom and that they moved into their cottage. After the Dwarfelles hear Snow White mention that the Prince was captured, Muddy comes up with the idea to see Mother Nature  and ask her for her help in finding the Prince. Back at the castle, Lord Maliss consults with the Looking Glass, who informs him that the Dwarfelles are living in the Seven Dwarfs' cottage and that Snow White is there. Upon the Looking Glass showing that Snow White and the Dwarfelles are heading toward Rainbow Falls, Maliss takes off stating that Scowl had better not get in his way again. Scowl and Batso take the opportunity to hide. Arriving at Mother Nature's sanctuary at Rainbow Falls, Snow White and the Dwarfelles encounter a talking Sunflower  who is one of the "hired help" for Mother Nature. Upon meeting Mother Nature , Snow White introduces herself and tells Mother Nature that the Dwarfelles said that she could help. Mother Nature speaks to the Dwarfelles holding Thunderella accountable for not mastering her powers and accuses the other Dwarfelles of misusing the powers that she gave them and are supposed to work together to help Mother Nature. As Snow White tries to get Mother Nature to give Thunderella a chance, the sound of Lord Maliss' dragon form is heard. Mother Nature then shoots Maliss with lightning, causing him to crash to the ground and reverts back to normal as Mother Nature then splits the ground. When Mother Nature demands that Lord Maliss leave, he tells Snow White that the Prince is held in his castle and states that Mother Nature can not stop him there. Maliss then reassumes his dragon form and leaves. Snow White convinces Mother Nature to let the Dwarfelles help her in rescuing the prince and Mother Nature then sends them on their way with the directions to Lord Maliss' castle in the Realm of Doom. Upon reaching a cave that leads into the Realm of Doom, Snow White and the Dwarfelles encounter a strange cloaked humanoid they call the "Shadow Man" before a flash flood washes them out of the cave and near Lord Maliss' castle. At Lord Maliss' castle, the Looking Glass tells Lord Maliss that it will be tough for Snow White to find his castle. Scowl and Batso are shown hiding in the dungeon when Lord Maliss sends his one-horned wolves to catch Snow White and dispose of the Dwarfelles. Batso sneezing on Scowl's cigar smoke ended up giving Scowl away to Lord Maliss. Maliss then grabs Scowl stating that he will do something to keep him occupied while Snow White is being captured. When the wolves close in on Snow White and the Dwarfelles that night, Moonbeam wakes up and notices the wolves. Sunburn then has Critterina communicate with them with Critterina telling the other Dwarfelles that the wolves will have them for dessert. When cornered on the cliff, Snow White and the Dwarfelles run into the "Shadow Man" who knocks down a tree for Snow White and the Dwarfelles to cross. The tree falls into the abyss with the wolves along with it. Upon seeing this in the looking glass, Lord Maliss is furious and decides to take care of the job himself as it shows Scowl over a boiling pot with the candle slowly burning away the ropes. In his dragon form, Maliss manages to successfully capture Snow White. When Batso arrives and finds Scowl hanging over a pot, he tells Batso to blow out the candle. Though the rope breaks, Scowl misses the pot. Upon seeing Lord Maliss return to the castle, Scowl tells Batso that they'd better leave. Scowl and Batso end up running into the Dwarfelles and unknowingly let them into the castle. This ended up causing the demons to scramble to capture them. Snow White then awakens in the presence of the Prince who then takes her through a secret passage. When the Dwarfelles catch up and wonder where Lord Maliss has taken her, the Looking Glass states that "beneath the Queen lies a secret door." After searching the area, they find a panel to the hidden door underneath the Queen's bust. Snow White is then taken to where she will be petrified by a magic red cloak as the Prince turns out to be Lord Maliss in disguise. As he is about to place a cape that will petrify her, Lord Maliss is then attacked by the "Shadow Man" as the petrifying cloak falls on a vicious lizard. As Maliss defeats and kills the "Shadow Man," the Dwarfelles arrive. After failed attacks by the Dwarfelles, Lord Maliss throws the petrifying cloak on all of them except Thunderella. Thunderella finally gains control of her powers and helps Snow White subdue Lord Maliss. As soon as Lord Maliss is trapped under the cloak, a massive thunderstorm is created. Lord Maliss is then forcibly transformed into his dragon state, grown to gigantic size, and then hit with several bolts of lightning, stunning him. Lastly his head transforms back into its human state, and he becomes complete stone. As the sun shines onto the castle, Snow White mourns the "Shadow Man" until Mother Nature arrives. It turns out that the "Shadow Man" was actually the Prince all along transformed into that state by Lord Maliss. Upon allowing the Dwarfelles to attend Snow White's wedding, Mother Nature states that the Dwarfelles have proven themselves to her. Mother Nature also ends up taking Scowl and Batso in as apprentices. Upon his cigar being removed, Scowl discovers that he can breathe again and tells Batso that working for Mother Nature will not be so bad. Snow White then hugs the Prince as they begin to live happily ever after.
