The movie opens with the feral Woman  circling what appears as her child with a wolf. The Woman is the last remaining member of a cannibalistic tribe that has roamed the northeast coast for decades (as seen in the 2009 film [[Offspring . While out hunting, Chris Cleek happens upon the Woman, who is bathing. He captures her in a net and knocks her out. He returns home with her, restrains her in a cellar, and directs his family to participate in "civilizing" her. Chris's kids, his son Brian and his daughter Peggy, are shown to be disturbed. Brian maliciously attacks his classmates, enjoying seeing them in pain and Peggy is withdrawn at school and wears very baggy clothes. Chris's first attempt to approach the woman results in her biting off and swallowing the end of his ring finger. Chris then orchestrates a series of violent civilizing measures. He is shown to be abusive to his wife, Belle, while Peggy is afraid of him. Chris bathes the Woman with boiling hot water and then decides to bathe her with a high-pressure power washer. Peggy, unable to stand it anymore, rushes to the Woman's aid, and turns off the power washer. That night, Chris rapes the Woman, while Brian secretly observes. Chris places a candle next to the Woman after the rape, something he did earlier with his daughter Peggy while she was being tucked in to bed, implying that he may have raped her as well. The next day, Brian comes home early from school and tortures the woman by using a pair of pliers on her nipple. When Peggy catches her brother assaulting the woman, she tells her mother, who reports the incident to Chris. Chris laughs it off, and Belle, who is usually demure, stands up to her husband's inhumanity, and announces she will take her daughters and leave, but not Brian. Chris then knocks Belle unconscious, just as Peggy's teacher Ms. Raton  rings the doorbell. Ms. Raton, suspicious about Peggy, tells Chris that she believes Peggy is pregnant. He becomes angry, believing her to have found out about the incest between him and Peggy, and hits her. He and Brian tie her hands and drag her to the barn where he keeps the dogs. Peggy protests, but Chris pushes her down and verbally assaults her. In the barn, Chris and Brian lock Ms. Raton in the dog's cage where two German Shepherds taunt her. The cage also contains an eyeless girl named "Socket"  who behaves like the two dogs. Socket and the dogs kill and eat Ms. Raton as Chris and Brian look on, smiling. Peggy then releases the imprisoned woman from the cellar. The woman attacks Belle, gnawing off most of her face before tossing her lifeless body in the air. She then proceeds to the barn, where she attacks Brian with a lawnmower blade, severing his torso. She then rips Chris's heart out and eats it. With her mother, father, and brother dead, a terrified Peggy attempts to escape with her little sister. The woman does not attack the girls; instead, she offers her bloody finger to the youngest daughter, who licks it, and then to Peggy, who does not. The woman, Socket, acting as the woman's dog, and the young girl walk away from the house, apparently forming a new family. Peggy initially watches, but then follows them towards the woods.
