The film follows a beautiful but troubled young girl, Debbie Strand , placed in foster care with her estranged grandmother in Los Angeles after her mother and father die in a suspicious house fire. Her grandmother is an ultra-conservative fundamentalist Christian, who is convinced that she can undo years of Debbie's presumed hedonism with some "correctional therapy." Shortly thereafter she begins to abuse Debbie and forces her to wear demeaning and outdated clothes. Debbie soon becomes enthralled with Peter Rinaldi , an English teacher at her new high school. However, Peter has a fianc√©e named Marilyn and strong scruples, so he repeatedly rejects Debbie's advances. Before long, Peter finds that his life is ruined and the bodies are piling up. During the hectic climax, Debbie breaks into Marilyn's home with the intention of wiping her out. Peter soon realizes Debbie is there and is quickly on his way. Meanwhile, Debbie confronts Marilyn. Marilyn runs through the kitchen, but Debbie tackles her to the ground. After a brief scuffle, Debbie is too strong as she knocks the helpless Marilyn unconscious. As she attempts to murder her, Peter rushes in and saves the day.
