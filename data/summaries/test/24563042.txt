The film begins by employing a hand-held style as the main protagonists, Koldo and Clara, are about to celebrate their wedding day. The wedding is primarily filmed by Koldo's cousin, Adrián, and their wedding photographer, Atun, plus footage cuts in from other guests' cell phones and cameras. All goes well and the guests travel to the wedding reception, held in a huge mansion, on chartered buses. Guests mingle whilst Adrián films his uncle, who says he was bitten by a dog, but claims he will be alright. The party is in full swing with everyone on the dance floor in the main ballroom. Outside, Adrián's uncle begins showing unusual symptoms such as vomiting. Adrián also captures people outside, in hazmat suits, searching the area and a police patrol car arriving. Back inside, Adrián's Uncle is sitting on a balcony overlooking the ballroom. Seemingly drunk he falls onto the floor below in full view of everyone. His wife approaches to help him up but he awakens and bites her. He stands and then vomits blood on another guest. Suddenly more guests infected with the demonic virus burst onto the dance floor, attacking guests. Amidst the ensuing chaos, Koldo and Clara are separated from each other. Koldo ends up with Adrián, Clara's sister Tita, Atun, and another male guest in the mansion's kitchen. Koldo asks Atun why is he still filming and destroys the camera. From then on the film returns to a normal third-person cinematic view and Koldo and the group begin to come up with a way to escape. They try the back exits but encounter more infected guests. CCTV footage shows the infected now roaming in the main ballroom. Koldo and the rest discover they fit through the air-conditioning vents, apart from Atun due to his size, and head outside as more infected make their way around the Mansion's courtyard. They discover the police car and go to use the radio. Koldo is attacked by Paloma, the woman the Uncle vomited on, who is now infected. Adrián and the others help him kill her. The unnamed guest tries to use the police car's radio to get help, but is attacked by the infected policeman. The sirens are set off attracting the infected towards them. Adrián, Koldo and Clara's sister then find refuge inside a chapel where other survivors have gathered. The infected cannot enter because of the holy water around the area. Clara's voice then comes over the P.A. system and, knowing Koldo is listening, she tells him she is alright and reveals she is pregnant, something she wanted to tell him earlier. Encouraged, Koldo suits up with a knight's armor to find her, telling the other survivors to hide the children in the charter buses. In the mansion, Clara and the priest from the wedding ceremony, are hiding in the Central Control room. Suddenly, a horde of infected people begins slamming on the windows trying to break into the room as Clara and the Priest watch in horror. The Priest then claims "it's too soon" and Clara asks what he means by that. The Priest then says he refers to the "Genesis" and talks about the nature of the Demons. Clara watches various CCTV shots from around the mansion showing the infected roaming and attacking guests. The Priest then begins to panic but Clara slaps him to calm him down and they escape through the window. Clara enters the room under and finds best man Rafa and Natalie, Clara's friend, but they soon run into more of the infected. On a staircase they encounter the infected Uncle's wife and other infected guests. In the mirror above the staircase, the infected are shown as reflections of the Niña Medeiros. The priest fights them off, freezing them with prayer. Meanwhile, Koldo finds the CCTV control room and witnesses as Adrian and the survivors are attacked by the incoming infected as the try to get onto the bus. In the background, a news report regarding the quarantine of an apartment block in central Barcelona is shown, revealing that the events of this film are happening concurrently with the events of the first film. Clara, Rafa and Natalie then find "John Sponge", the children's entertainer, and they try to escape, but Natalie is attacked by one of Clara's infected bridesmaids. Outside, Clara comes face to face with her infected mother. The mother pauses then runs toward Clara to attack her. John shoots her. Clara holds onto her mother's body but Rafa persuades her to leave her as she is dead. With more infected coming, John gets bitten as Rafa and Clara go underground into a tunnel. With the opportunity to leave, Rafa insists they go, but Clara refuses to leave without Koldo. Rafa suggests that if he was alive he would have given some sort of sign. Inside Koldo surveys the devastation and ruins of his wedding in the ballroom. He turns up the volume on one of the songs on the dance floor, the song that backed the photo montage, at the start of the film. Clara then grabs a chainsaw and goes to find Koldo as she sees this as a sign. The song now heard is 'Eloise' which Clara and Koldo danced to. She fights off a horde of infected, but Rafa is bitten in the process by an infected waiter. He asks Clara to kill him. Clara then proceeds to decapitate him. Clara then runs away from incoming horde of infected. She and Koldo find their way back to each other at last, Koldo spots her in the tunnel below the kitchen and lowers a ladder. Their reunion is short-lived as a swarm of infected crash into the kitchen. However they all suddenly freeze in place as the priest recites prayers over the P.A. system. Clara and Koldo exit and find more of the infected frozen in place. As they make their way outside, they are attacked by Koldo's infected grandfather who, being deaf, cannot hear the prayers. Clara is bitten and tells Koldo to cut her arm off before the Infection consumes her. Koldo does so and they leave, seemingly having survived it all. However, when they reach the exit, they discover everything has been quarantined. Clara vomits blood and is ultimately consumed by the Infection. Devastated, Koldo picks her up and takes her outside where the police and a SWAT team tell him to let her go because she is infected. Clara and Koldo share a final kiss before Clara bites his tongue off and attacks the armed men, who shoot both of them down. In their final moments Clara and Koldo use their last bit of strength to hold each others hands.
