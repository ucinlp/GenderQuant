Lakshmi Krishna Devaraya @ LK , a famous advocate, always fights on behalf of criminals and make them win the case with impeccable argument. However, LK believes that he was the envoy of God and implements the real justice after the court acquits them by killing the accused in the name of cosmic justice. His sister  always encourages him in every case. In fact, LK's parents commit suicide as they did not get justice in the court when their daughter was raped, but the culprit escapes from the clutches of law. So, LK turns an advocate and argues on behalf of culprits and finally punishes them on his own. Sri Mahalakshmi , an MBBS student, was the daughter of a teacher Sambamurthy . She gets killed by some nine NRI girls. Their parents meet LK and urge him to save their children who were fixed in a murder case. LK makes a thorough research on the subject and gets the girls acquitted. But in his personal enquiry, LK finds that the hostel matron Olga Rose Mary , medical college principal Bhogendra Bhalla and public prosecutor Janardhan  were behind Sri Mahalakshmi's death. It is Janardhan and Bhalla who raped the girl which led to her death but imposed the case on NRI girls. Finally LK implements the cosmic justice by killing all the three accused.
