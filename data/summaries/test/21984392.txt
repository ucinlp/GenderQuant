Antonio Trabbi is a greedy old man with a very rough personality and obsessed by money. He deprecates charity and love and has not friends or love interests, being lonely and avoided by people. During Christmas Eve he is visited by the ghost of his former business partner, who warns him about his life-style and announces the visit of three spiritis, who will show Antonio the past, present and future Christmas days. During the night, the three spirits actually appear at Trabbi, showing him his sad past, the bad reputation he has with every people and the bad outcome of his actions, which will lead him to a lonely death and to terrible punishments in Hell. When Trabbi wakes up he is heavily distressed by the visions and eager to change his life, starting with that very same Christmas Day.
