Lindsay  and Jenny , two American tourists in Germany, are drugged and involuntarily detained by crazed surgeon Dr. Josef Heiter  when they seek help at his house after their car breaks down. The women awake in a makeshift medical ward. They witness Heiter kill a kidnapped truck driver  after Heiter informs him he is "not a match". When the woman wakes up a second time, Heiter has secured a new male captive, Japanese tourist Katsuro . The doctor explains that he is a world-renowned expert at separating Siamese twins, but dreams of making new creatures by sewing people together. He describes in detail how he will surgically connect his three victims mouth-to-anus, so that they share a single digestive system. After Lindsay tries to escape and fails, Heiter explains to her that he had previously experimented with creating what he called a "three-dog", also joined mouth-to-anus. However, the three-dog died shortly after surgery. Heiter tells Lindsay that the middle dog of his creation experienced the most pain, and as punishment for her escape attempt she will become the middle part of his centipede. Heiter performs the surgery on his victims placing Katsuro at the front, Lindsay in the middle and Jenny at the rear. During his procedure, Heiter severs the ligaments in his victims' knees so they cannot stand and are forced to crawl, and connects the victims together in a line with their mouths surgically attached to the anus of the person in front of them. Once the operation is complete, Heiter attempts to train his centipede as a pet, often belitting Katsuro with racist insults and beating him with a crop when he becomes rebellious. When Katsuro defecates, Lindsay is forced to swallow his excrement while the doctor watches in delight. However, he eventually becomes irritated after being kept awake by the constant screaming of Katsuro  and the realization that Jenny is dying from blood poisoning. When two detectives, Kranz  and Voller , visit the house to investigate the disappearance of tourists, Heiter decides to add them as replacements for Jenny in a new creation, a four-person centipede. Heiter succeeds in drugging one of the detectives, Voller, as the pair later leave the house to obtain a search warrant. The victims attempt to escape from the ward, crawling up the stairs, as Katsuro also attacks Heiter in the process. Their attempt to escape ultimately fails. Katsuro confesses to the doctor, in Japanese, that he deserves his fate because he had treated his family poorly. Katsuro then commits suicide by slitting his throat with a shard of broken glass. The detectives return to the house and forcefully conduct separate searches as an injured Heiter hides near his swimming pool. Kranz finds the makeshift ward along with Heiter's victims in another room. Meanwhile Voller begins to feel ill from the earlier drugging, and is later shot by Heiter. Kranz discovers Voller dead in the swimming pool. Heiter shoots Kranz in the stomach, and Kranz responds by shooting Heiter in the head. Kranz then falls in the pool, dead. Back in the house, Jenny and Lindsay hold hands as Jenny dies from her infection. Lindsay sobs as she is left alone in the house, trapped between her deceased fellow captives.
