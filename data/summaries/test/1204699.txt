"Darn Cat" or "DC" is a wily, adventurous Siamese tomcat who lives with two young women, suburbanite sisters Ingrid  and Patti Randall , whose parents are traveling abroad at the time of the story. One night, while making his rounds around town, teasing Blitzy the Bulldog as usual, DC follows Iggy , a bank robber, to an apartment where he and his partner Dan  are holding bank employee Margaret Miller  hostage, calling her "Moms" in the process. The robbers let the cat in and feed him. When Margaret is alone for a moment, she attempts to scratch "help" into the back of her watch , places it around the cat's neck, and releases him into the outdoors. At home, Patti discovers the watch, has a gut feeling it belongs to the kidnapped woman and visits the FBI. She likes the kind looks and Agent Zeke Kelso ([[Dean Jones  and tells him of her discovery. Supervisor Newton  assigns Kelso to follow DC in hopes he will lead them back to the robbers' hideout. Kelso sets up a headquarters in the Randalls' house and assigns a team to keep the cat under surveillance, but DC manages to elude them. Eventually a bugging device is implanted in DC's collar and the cat leads Zeke into a comical chase at a drive-in movie and several backyards. Eventually, Patti and Zeke rescue Margaret and bring the robbers to justice.
