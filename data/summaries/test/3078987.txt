The seaside town of Fircombe is facing a crisis - it's always raining and there's nothing for the tourists to do. So Councillor Sidney Fiddler  hits on the notion of holding a beauty contest. The Mayor, Frederick Bumble  is taken with the idea but feminist Councillor, Augusta Prodworthy  is outraged. She storms out of the meeting in disgust. The motion is carried in Augusta's absence and Sidney contacts publicist Peter Potter  to help with the organisation. Sidney's girlfriend, Connie Philpotts  runs a local hotel and soon her residents, including the eccentric Mrs Dukes  and the Admiral  are outnumbered by dolly birds, including the feuding biker babe, Hope Springs  and the bountiful Dawn Brakes . A fight orchestrated by Hope provides better newspaper copy than bringing a donkey off the beach which, despite the bucket and spade of hotel employee William ([[Jack Douglas , ruins the plush carpets! Press photographer Larry  happily snaps the Mayor losing his trousers at a most awkward moment and nervously gulps his way through a nude session with Dawn. Eventually, the Mayor's wife, Mildred  joins Prodworthy's bra-burning movement and plots the downfall of the Miss Fircombe contest on the pier. Peter Potter reluctantly becomes a man in a frock for another publicity gimmick for the television show, Women's Things, presented by Cecil Gaybody  and produced by Debra . Prodworthy and butch feminist Rosemary  call in the police ([[David Lodge  but Peter's girlfriend, Paula  steps into the breach as the mysterious girl. Finally Prodworthy's gang put "Operation Spoilsport" into action, sabotaging the final contest with water, mud and itching powder. With an angry mob after his blood, Sidney makes his escape with Hope on her motorcycle.
