After five years of marriage, chemical engineer Lorenzo Xavier Vega  tends to neglect his wife Susan  in favor of his work. When she wishes aloud that she had a more attentive spouse, her Guardian Angel -- coincidentally the mirror image of her favorite movie star  -- appears. He advises her to take a greater interest in Lorenzo's career, so she agrees to accompany him on a camping trip to test the revolutionary new insecticide he's developed.  Susan's dream of a second honeymoon turns into a nightmare when everything that possibly could go wrong does.
