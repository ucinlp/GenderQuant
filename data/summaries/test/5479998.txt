Both master and servant are enchanted by Camille, whom Mirakle plans to become Erik's mate. He invites her to come and take a closer look at Erik, who grabs Camille's bonnet. Dupin tries to get it back, when Erik tries to strangle him. Mirakle backs him off and offers Camille to replace the bonnet. But Camille is reluctant and suspicious to give the doctor her address, so, when they leave, Mirakle orders his servant Janos  to follow her.  One of Mirakle's victims, a prostitute, is found dead in a river , and is fished out and taken to the police station. Dupin wants to examine the girl's blood, but the morgue keeper  won't allow.
