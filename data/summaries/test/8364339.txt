{{plot}} DJ Williams  is a young man in inner-city Los Angeles. He and his younger brother Duron ([[Chris Brown  compete in local dance competitions as members of a crew known as the "Goon Squad". During the battle there are backs and forths, but in the end of the battle the Goon Squad win a cash-prize, and the losing home crew responds by ambushing DJ and his crewmates after the show. A fight breaks out, and the leader of the rival crew starts beating up DJ. Duron pushes him away and starts fighting him, leading the rival to pull out a gun, killing Duron. Arrested for assault, DJ is subsequently sent by his mother to live with his aunt Jackie  and uncle Nate  in Atlanta, Georgia, where he is to attend historically black Truth University. Nate, the physical plant director at Truth, aims to teach DJ responsibility and puts him to work doing maintenance as part of a work-study program. While waiting in line to register for classes, DJ sees a fellow student, April Palmer , to whom he is immediately attracted. After registration, he moves into his dorm room, where he meets his new roommate Rich Brown . Rich meets DJ at a stepping competition on the green between the Truth chapters of rival fraternities Theta Nu Theta and Mu Gamma Xi. The Mu Gamma Xi crew, seven-time national stepping champions, easily steals the show until DJ sees April across the way and runs right through their step line in an attempt to speak to her. A fight nearly breaks out between the freshman and the Gamma steppers, whose best stepper, Grant  is April's boyfriend. That night, Rich and his friends go out to a local club called the Phoenix and invite DJ along. Hoping to impress April and upstage Grant and the Gammas , DJ takes to the floor. Despite the animosity between DJ and Grant, the Gammas recognize his skills as a dancer and their chapter president Zeke  invites him to pledge for Mu Gamma Xi. DJ turns down both Zeke's offer as well as an offer from the Theta Nu Theta chapter's leader Sylvester . After learning that April is a student history tutor, DJ signs himself up for tutoring so that he can spend time with her. The two slowly begin a friendship and DJ takes April out to dinner. During their date, April discusses the importance of black fraternities and sororities with DJ, and tells him to visit Heritage Hall on the campus' Greek Row. The next day, DJ learns about the significant number of African-American historical figures and celebrities who were members of various Greek-letter organizations, and decides to pledge for the Theta chapter along with Rich and their friend Noel . After "crossing over" to become official Theta members, DJ, Rich, and Noel join the Thetas' step crew. Dismissing the chapter's traditional step moves as old-fashioned, DJ teaches his frat brothers a few of his old krumping moves. Sly disapproves of DJ's attempts to modernize Thetas' steps, and challenges DJ to a battle at the Phoenix between his line brothers and DJ's; the new moves against the old. DJ's line brothers lose the competition due to his show-boating, though Sly lets DJ teach the crew some new moves as a compromise. April eventually leaves Grant for DJ, angering her father, Dr. William Palmer , the school's Provost and a Gamma brother himself. A few of the Gammas run a background check on DJ, and learn about the fight in which DJ's brother was killed, and for which DJ was convicted for aggravated assault in an unfair trial. This information is forwarded to the school's Ethics Committee, which suspends DJ for the remainder of the year. Dr. Palmer, who has the authority to overturn the Ethics Committee's decision, later offers to reinstate DJ with the provision that he stop seeing April, which he refuses. When April learns from her father why DJ has been suspended, she questions DJ and learns first-hand the story behind his arrest. DJ's Aunt Jackie, an old girlfriend of Dr. Palmer's, confronts him and is joined by April who overheard the conversation, leading Dr. Palmer to overturn the Ethics Committee's decision. Reinstated thanks to April's help, DJ Arrives just in time to take part in the final round of the nationals stepping competition, which ends in a tie between the Thetas and Gammas, leading to a head-to-head competition between DJ and Grant. Unknown to DJ and the Thetas, the Gammas had recorded DJ practicing his moves prior to the competition. Going first, Grant does DJ's exact routine from the videotape. After he finishes, DJ matches Grant move for move, but tosses in something the Gammas didn't get on tape: a move Duron performed to win his last competition . The Theta Nu Theta crew win the competition, and DJ is congratulated by his frat brothers as April runs out to kiss him. The scene is captured in a still black-and-white photo, which is added to the wall at Heritage Hall. A quote of Martin Luther King appears just before the credits. "Intelligence plus character. That is the goal of true education."
