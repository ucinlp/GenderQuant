Set 10 years after the events of Attack of the Killer Tomatoes , the United States is once again safe, and tomatoes have been outlawed . Wilbur Finletter  has been praised as a hero of the Great Tomato War and parlayed his fame into opening Finletter's Pizzeria, which serves tomato-less pizzas. Working for Wilbur is his nephew Chad Finletter  who is a delivery boy. Also with Chad is his roommate Matt Stevens , a suave ladies' man. However, trouble returns with a misanthropic villain, Professor Mortimer Gangreen  and his assistant Igor  seek to unleash another wave of tomato terror. Professor Gangreen was perplexed at being defeated by "Puberty Love", the worst song ever created, and says that this time music will aid, rather than hinder him. Gangreen has created a tomato transformation chamber by which he can turn ordinary tomatoes into replicas of men and women. By dipping ordinary tomatoes into vats of toxic waste and then placing them into the chamber, Gangreen uses music to his advantage, as the juke box that is hooked up to the chamber syncs up with the tomato transformation chamber, allowing him to create virtually anything by the use of whatever song he has picked . Gangreen's preferred music is rock, which creates soldiers. With his tomato commandos, Professor Gangreen seeks to attack the nearby prison where he will break out his imprisoned ally Jim Richardson , then take over the United States under the subjugation of his killer tomatoes and installing Richardson as President of the United States. Gangreen has also used his device to create an attractive female replica named Tara , who serves as Gangreen's assistant until she realizes his abusive attitude towards a wrongly mutated tomato whom she dubs FT, or Fuzzy Tomato. Tara defects to Finletter's Pizza where she starts dating Chad. This film marks the first appearance of FT, the Fuzzy Tomato. Other notable characters are Chad Finletter , nephew of Wilbur Finletter  and his girlfriend Tara , who is actually a female Killer Tomato turned into an attractive girl by the device. Tara turns back into a tomato when she hears the opening musical notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony; however, the musical notes of the theme to Gone with the Wind restores her to human form. The characters and timeline of this film were recycled for the Attack of the Killer Tomatoes: The Animated Series . Return of the Killer Tomatoes! also has the distinction of being one of George Clooney's earliest movies. This was shot in National City. It was also filmed on 3rd Avenue in Chula Vista in what is now known as Don Pedro's Taco Shop. A trailer to the film shows up on some VHS copies of Dead Heat.
