Events depicted in the movie unfold in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The Americans are bombing Vietnamese towns and villages, breaking into households, killing women and children. All ships of the European merchant fleet have already left the coast of North Vietnam, but the Soviet dry cargo ship “Chelyabinsk” refuses to leave Vietnamese shores despite a United States military ultimatum. A few days later the ship is sunk and Soviet sailors come to the aid their Vietnamese comrades and join a caravan of Vietnamese insurgents moving along the Ho Chi Min Trail. The plot concerns the visit of an American actress to worn-torn North Vietnam. At the height of the Vietnam War, actress Kate Francis  travels along with the resistance fighters and witnesses first-hand the destruction heaped upon the Vietnamese people by the American forces. Before returning to the US in order to deliver the truth about the current state of matters to the wider international community, she organizes a press conference to relate all that she has seen and to literally sing the praises of the Vietnamese people. Meanwhile in Haiphong, Kate’s Vietnamese friend Mai introduces her to her husband, combat engineer Phong, who has recently returned home from the Soviet Union aboard the Chelyabinsk. The CIA is preparing an explosion in Haiphong port, but friends manage to prevent it.
