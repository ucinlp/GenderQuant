Air Force pilot John Sands has been wrongfully imprisoned in a military detention center where his memory is to be chemically wiped. His superiors feel threatened by the knowledge he gained from his assignments to operations that were deemed too sensitive for regular intelligence services. Later, a top secret Air Force Stealth Bomber known as the X-77, capable of going anywhere undetected, is stolen by corrupt Air Force pilot Ratcher. General Tom Barnes, Sands' former commander, hears that Sands has been arrested after taking down a group of men who were robbing a rest stop. Knowing that Sands was Ratcher's trainer, Barnes sends Sands to northern Afghanistan with fellow pilot Rick Jannick to recover the X-77, promising Sands that he will be a free man if he succeeds. Barnes has Admiral Frank Pendleton, who is on an aircraft carrier in the Gulf of Arabia, keep a team of pilots on standby just in case an air attack needs to be launched on the compound where the X-77 has been hidden. Before Sands and Jannick arrive in Afghanistan, a Navy SEAL team that was planted there to meet them is killed by a group of men led by Eliana Reed. Eliana kidnaps Jannick, and she takes him to her boss, Peter Stone, the man who paid Ratcher $100 million to steal the X-77. Later, in a village close to Stone's compound, Sands meets up with his contacts Jessica and Rojar. As it turns out, Stone was born from a Muslim mother and a British father. Stone had spent his childhood in the Middle East, but was educated at Oxford. Stone's mother was killed in an attack by U.S. troops during Desert Storm, and as a result, a vengeful Stone formed the Black Sunday terrorist group. Eliana is Stone's second-in-command. She trains with various guerrilla groups in the region, giving Stone the foundation he needs. Now, Stone plans to use the X-77 and its pinpoint precision to drop two biological warfare bombs undetectedâ€”one of them on Europe, and one of them on the United States. Stone plans to pay Ratcher another $100 million to fly the X-77 and drop the two bombs. Sands, Jessica, and Rojar make plans to get into Stone's compound and launch an attack, but Stone has about 60 heavily armed mercenaries guarding the compound. Rojar starts a gun fight between the terrorists while Sands rescues Jannick. After a feud about the money, Ratcher shoots and kills Stone. Sands takes on a few of the terrorists by hand as Jessica shoots and kills Eliana. Jannick catches Ratcher while Sands and Jessica leave in the X-77 but Ratcher manages to shoot him and get up in the air in a F16. After a brief dogfight Sands manages to shoot Ratcher down and return home.
