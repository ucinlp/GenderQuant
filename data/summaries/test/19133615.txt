The police call in Professor Langford Fife , a professor of symbology at a local community college, to help them solve the mystery. As the curator was dying, he put on a pair of rubber overalls. He held a lemon in one hand and a can of Chicken of the Sea in the other. He called the police as he was dying and told them that Mr. Fife could decode the message. Mr. Fife meets Sopha Poisson during the course of his investigation. She informs him that the murdered curator was her grandfather.
