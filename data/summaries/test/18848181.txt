Granny leaves the house for an outing, but as she drives by the house and waves goodbye to Tweety, she sees Sylvester has gotten into the house and is about to eat the bird. Granny stops the cat in time and, fed up with his constant chasing after Tweety, gives him an ultimatum: "If there's so much as one little feather harmed on the canary, it's off to the violin string factory!" . As Sylvester sulks in the corner, Tweety is about to face a new threat—a rough-looking orange cat wearing an eyepatch. The unnamed orange cat is after a meal of his own and is uncaring that Sylvester will be deemed responsible if Tweety is noticed missing. As such, the chase now casts Sylvester not as the predator but as the  protagonist who plans to save Tweety from a predatory cat before Granny returns—more to save his own skin. After several exchanges, with both Sylvester and the orange cat clobbering each other, Sylvester finally gets rid of the predatory cat by blowing him up in Granny's chimney . However, Sylvester's efforts are in vain. As he is putting Tweety back in the cage, Granny enters and, assuming he was after Tweety, promises to make good on her earlier threat. Sylvester tried to explain what really happened before declaring: "Aw, what's the use! She'll never believe me!", then he plays Chopin on his violin and falls into the violin case as a coffin to his doom.
