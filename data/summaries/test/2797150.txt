Andre Shame  is a private detective formerly of the LAPD, who left the force after failing to crack the case on drug lord Ernesto Mendoza . The investigation of Mendoza's case was a personal one for Shame, as his ex-girlfriend Angela  was caught in the middle of a love triangle with the two men. Years later, Sonny Rothmiller , Shame's ex-colleague who is now working for the DEA, tells him that the Mendoza case is being re-opened, and though he has his doubts, Shame decides the case is too intriguing to pass on, and tells Sonny to count him in. The situation gets rather complicated when Shame's old flame Angela resurfaces in his life, and he also realizes that some of his allegiances aren't what, or whom, they seem to be on the surface. Tagline: He's armed and dangerously funny.
