The film was written by Pulitzer Prize winner Ira Berkow, and narrated by two-time Academy Award winning actor Dustin Hoffman. It was directed by Peter Miller, a documentary filmmaker known for his previous films A Class Apart, Sacco and Vanzetti, and The Internationale.{{cite web}} Dustin Hoffman does not normally narrate films, and initially turned down the project. But when he looked at the script, he changed his mind, saying: "Oh, this is about bigotry and overcoming anti-Semitism, about discrimination and these issues that I grew up with, that really matters to me". The stereotype of Jews as non-athletic, as well as anti-semitism, are two issues that many Jewish baseball players faced and had to overcome. Noted anti-semite Henry Ford wrote on May 22, 1920: “If fans wish to know the trouble with American baseball they have it in three words—too much Jew.”<ref namehttp://nyblueprint.com/articles/view.aspx?id Jews and Baseball Is A Film You Should Catch|authorThe New York Blueprint |dateDecember 12, 2010}} A number of early Jewish ballplayers changed their names, so that it would not be apparent that they were Jewish.{{cite web}} Director Miller said:  At its heart, this is a film about overcoming stereotypes. Bigotry against Jews has faded a great deal...  The story of a once-marginalized people finding their way into the American mainstream offers lessons for a country that continues to grapple with its ideal as a place where talent should overcome prejudice, where we can retain our differences while still being American, where anyone who can hit or pitch or run can be a part of the magic and drama of our national game.<ref namefull "Baseball as a cultural connection; Documentary explores special ties for Jews]," Maureen Mullen, The Boston Globe, December 9, 2010, accessed December 11, 2010] The documentary contains rare archival footage and photos, and music ranging from Benny Goodman to Yo-Yo Ma to Rush.&#60;ref namehttp://www.jewsandbaseball.com/players.html |titleJewsandbaseball.com |dateDecember 12, 2010}} Also featured in the film are Norm Sherry, Ron Blomberg, Maury Allen, Larry King, Ron Howard, and Yogi Berra.http://www.jewsandbaseball.com/{{cite web}}  The documentary focuses especially on two players. One is Hank Greenberg, a two-time American League MVP, five-time All Star, and Hall of Famer. Anti-Semitic barbs directed at him from the stands served to motivate him, he said. The film notes a column in the Detroit Free Press, in which Edgar Guest wrote in response to Greenberg&#39;s absence from the lineup: “We shall miss him on the infield, and shall miss him at the bat, but he’s true to his religion and we honor him for that.”&#60;ref nameNovember 17, 2010 | 12:01 pm |url Patrick Goldstein and James Rainey |titleThe Los Angeles Times |dateDecember 12, 2010}} Koufax agreed to a rare filmed interview for the documentary.{{cite web}} Youkilis notes in the film: It’s something that I probably won’t realize until my career is over, how many people are really rooting for me and cheering for me. And it’s not just because I went 3-for-4, or had a great game. It’s just the fact that I represent a lot of Jewish people and a lot of the Jewish heritage and the struggles that a lot of our people have had.
