The protagonist, Tori Olafsdotter , a meteorologist working at the Eno Meteorological Institute who will later become Ice. New Metro is then attacked by a tornado being controlled by a terrorist calling himself the Weatherman . The Flash  diffuses the tornado using his speed while the other members of the JLA use their powers to save civilians. Tori stumbles upon a hidden device in the lab where she works. While investigating its use, she spills water on it and it strikes her with strange blue electricity. She is unharmed and leaves the lab for home freezing everything she touches. En route she sees a man drowning, when she attempts to rescue him the water freezes around her. That night she is abducted by the JLA and interrogated, believing her to be the Weatherman. They release her and Tori believes it was all simply a bad dream.  The JLA suspect that Tori's timid work colleague Arliss Hopke is The Weatherman. New Metro is then attacked again, this time by golf ball-sized hailstones, but Fire melts them all. The JLA infiltrate a party at the Eno Meteorological Institute looking for evidence that Arliss Hopke is The Weatherman. Tori then discovers that it is in fact her boss, Dr Eno who is The Weatherman. Tori takes this knowledge to the JLA and they in turn take her to their secret command center, an alien spacecraft hidden underwater. The JLA's leader J'onn J'onzz  introduces himself to Tori and the other members of the League reveal their secret identities. At this point Tori discovers that The Atom  is actually a man with whom she has been flirting. The JLA attempt to train Tori to hone her freezing powers without much success. After another heroic act by the JLA, Martin Walters  watches a news broadcast about the incident and sees that Fire is wearing earrings that he earlier gave B.B. as a gift. When he next sees her, Martin tells B.B. that he knows her secret identity, but B.B. secretly alerts the JLA to her predicament. J'onn then arrives on the scene disguised as Fire, claiming to know B.B. as a close friend and to have been lent the earrings. Martin is left embarrassed by his 'mistake' and B.B.  takes the opportunity to break up with him, although she assures him that he's a nice guy and that he will find true love someday. The Weatherman issues a demand of $20 million or he will engulf New Metro in a tidal wave. He then attacks the Watchtower using a heat ray. The JLA escape and devise a plan to stop the wave, leaving Tori behind. The JLA's attempt to stop the tidal wave is unsuccessful, and it is Tori who stops it by turning it into ice. Later, the other heroes go to Tori's house to apologise for leaving her behind and repeat their offer to join the team, offering her a costume and suggesting she adopt the codename 'Ice'. Tori forgives them and the group return to their ordinary lives,including Barry Allen starting a new job, B.B. meeting up again with Martin  and Ray and Tori spending the day together. The film ends with the Weatherman already hatching his escape from prison and Tori joining the JLA.
