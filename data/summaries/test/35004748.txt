Every year, the United Nations Organization  publishes a Report on Human Development which establishes a worldwide ranking of countries based on a large correlation of social, economic, demographic and health indicators. For the fifth consecutive year, Norway appears as the most developed country on the planet, while Nigeria takes last place once again on this prestigious list, identifying it as the least developed country in the world. This documentaryâ€™s intent is to get to know the people who live in these countries, what they think, how they live and how they feel. But it also shows us that people's happiness is not necessarily linked to how "developed" a country is.
