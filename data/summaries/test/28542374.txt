Anna  arrives in Italy to stay with her old schoolfriend Verena  and her family in their rented villa in Tuscany. She was meant to be accompanied by her partner, Alex, but she tells Verena that he had to stay in London to work at the last minute. Over the course of the film it become apparent that Anna took the holiday to get some time away from Alex following a fight. The group is split into an unspoken line between the "olds": Verena, her new husband Charlie  and Verena's cousin George ; and the "youngs": Verena's two teenage children Jack  and Badge , Charlie's son Archie , and George's son Oakley . Trying to escape her relationship worries with Alex, Anna finds herself spending increasingly more time with the teenagers, upsetting Verena. She joins in with their mild hedonism, even promising not to tell their parents about their dope smoking and a drug and drink-fueled car accident in a borrowed car. The simmering sexual tension and flirtation between Anna and Oakley, the teenagers ringleader, comes to a head when she invites him in to spend the night but he turns her down. Anna eventually tells Verena about the car accident, getting the teenagers into serious trouble and causing Oakley to have an appalling fight with his father. Totally rejected by the teenage group as a result, Anna leaves the villa and checks in to a local hotel. Verena seeks her out, and the two reconcile after Anna reveals she has discovered that she can't have children. She returns to the villa with Verena, is reconciled with the teenagers, and stays on for a few days after the rest of the party have left. In the final scene we see Anna in a taxi to the airport on the phone to Alex, seemingly looking forward to seeing him again.{{cite web}}
