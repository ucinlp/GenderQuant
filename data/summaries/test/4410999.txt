The plot revolves around a clique of four girls who devise a plan to weaken the boys at their school with arsenic. The plan is to slowly poison the boys through their lunches, inspired by the "queen bee" Chloe's obsession with the novel Flowers in the Attic. As the plan progresses, a minor conversation discussing how important slavery was starts a gossip ring that leads to Chloe's eventual downfall. The young actresses in Coppola's film have no other screen credits to their names. Peter Bogdanovich appears in a cameo as the Principal. The director of photography was Lance Acord. Coppola's own eye appears in one dream-like shot. The film's themes also appear in Coppola's later work, such as the feelings of isolation; in addition, the film begins with a car journey, just like her later films The Virgin Suicides, Lost in Translation, and Somewhere.
