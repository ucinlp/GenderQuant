The movie centres around a group of friends: Kevin , Sam  and Rob . They play a game, known as "Foolproof", in which they create working plans to infiltrate and burgle various targets. They do not actually execute these heists, preferring to simply simulate them. All is fine until a famous criminal, Leo Gillete , steals the trio's plans to burglarize a jewelry company and accomplishes the heist. He then blackmails the group into designing and executing a plan to steal $20 million in bonds from a bank. Tension escalates within the group as Rob befriends Leo, while Kevin and Sam attempt to hinder his plans.
