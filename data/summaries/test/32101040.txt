Gérald Boulet was in music from an early age. In the end of the 1960s, he founded the rock band Offenbach with his brother Denis. The group saw great success and peaked in the 1970s with the joining of Pierre Harel. After many years, Offenbach disbanded and Boulet started a solo career with great success in Québec. After many years of drug and alcohol abuse, he was diagnosed with colon cancer and died in 1990, at the age of 44.
