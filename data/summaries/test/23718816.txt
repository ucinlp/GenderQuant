A man walks along with a Cello under his arm. He then sits down on a stool and proceeds to play it, very badly, while the neighbors proceed throw all manner of things at him to make him stop. At one point, a Couch is thrown at him, but neither this nor any other projectile is a successful deterrent. At the end of the film, a girl comes up to him and gives him some flowers. The man then stops playing and walks off, happy that his talents have been recognised.
