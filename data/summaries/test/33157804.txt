The three sleepy children sail in their shoe-boat; they stall briefly on a cloud, then have various troubles with their fishing lines. Nod lands a fish-like star that ends up squirming in his pants. A star hooks Wynken and Nod's candy-cane baited lines together. The stars tease Nod while he's hanging overboard. A comet comes through; they catch it in a net and it tows them wildly, until they land in another cloud, where they are tossed by storms, eventually breaking their mast and sending them back to earth .
