After finding gold in Alaska, George Pratt  sends partner Sam McCord  to Seattle to bring back his fianc√©e, a French girl whom Sam has never met. Finding there that George's girl has already married another man, Sam brings back prostitute "Angel"  as a substitute. There is a misunderstanding: she thinks Sam wants her for himself and begins to become enamored with him during the boat trip to Alaska, during which he treats her like a respectable lady. An angry George rejects the girl outright, though his younger brother Billy ([[Fabian  is definitely interested. Meanwhile, con man and saloon owner Frankie Cannon  tries to steal their gold claim. In time, George takes a liking to Angel and is willing to marry her. But once he realizes that she has fallen for his partner, he does everything in his power to coax Sam into admitting that he, too, is in love. Meanwhile, the men discovered Cannon's scam after he convinced his illiterate janitor, so they try to reclaim their right in the court. The story concludes with an all-out brawl in the town's muddy streets. Angel decides to leave but the guys convince her to stay.
