A gang of criminals kidnaps the son of James Kennedy, who is an American executive of a London-based chemical company. Kennedy ignores the advice of Inspector Hazelrigg of Scotland Yard to try a plan of his own. He doubles the ransom amount, expecting the thieves to have a falling-out over how to divide it. One is indeed killed, and evidence at the crime scene leads Kennedy to a home in Hamstead where the mastermind, Feist, is keeping Kennedy's son. Hazelrigg comes along, but agrees to give Kennedy a few minutes to enter the house alone. Armed with a flamethrower, Kennedy is able to take his son to safety while the police close in on Feist.
