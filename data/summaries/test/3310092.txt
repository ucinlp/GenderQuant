The film is a modern-day version of the Rasputin story; the major characters have the same first names as Rasputin and the Romanov royal family, and their family name 'Rast' is simply 'Tsar' backwards. Hemmings plays an up-and-coming senator, Nick Rast, whose young son is terminally ill with leukaemia. A mysterious faith healer, Gregory Wolfe , appears and seems to cure the boy. Rast's wife Sandy  falls in love with Wolfe, but the powerful interests behind Rast's career, represented by geriatric monster Doc Wheelan  are less happy with events.
