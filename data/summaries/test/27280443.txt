A woman reporter helps an inspector solve the deaths of four financiers on the eve of a group shareout. Based on "Les Six Hommes Morts"  by Andr√© Steeman. Robert Norman is shot dead at his home. Inspector Winton arrives on the scene to investigate the murder and finds that it has occurred shortly before an important meeting between a group of five financiers of whom Norman was one. Budding journalist Claire Haines also manages to talk her way into the house in an attempt to impress her editor by gathering exclusive news on the murder. The other financiers realise they are also in danger when another one of their number is murdered. Inspector Winton sets a trap for the killer using one of the financiers as bait, unmasking the killer as one of the group who had earlier faked his own murder.  {{Empty section}}
