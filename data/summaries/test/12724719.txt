Lesley Hahn lives in California, and is plagued by nightmares about faceless telephone repairmen entering her house and taking her. She contacts psychiatrist Dr Neil Chase in hope of receiving treatment for her nightmares. Mary Wilkes, is a housewife from Nebraska who has a history of unexplained blackouts and one night ends up on a motorway miles from her home. She is also plagued by nightmares similar to those experienced by Lesley. Mary decides to take a holiday in California with her sister, who knows Dr Chase, and is persuaded to see the psychiatrist to find out if he can help with her nightmares. Initially, Dr Chase does not believe Lesley, thinking her nightmares to be related to childhood abuse, but becomes convinced something else is happening when Mary tells him of similar experiences. Neil is struck by the similarities between the two cases, and realises that symbols seen on board an alien ship and drawn by Mary are similar to that of another patient of his, a former soldier who encountered a crashed UFO which was recovered by the government. Making contact with a university professor who does research into alien abductions, he begins to investigate the wider world of alien encounters, and runs into a general who is investigating UFOs in secret. Finally, Mary is abducted again, and learns the true purpose of the aliens.
