Simone  and Eddie , two predatory lenders, awaken in a room with a caged-in scale, wearing head harnesses with screws poised to pierce their temples. They are informed via videotape that whoever sets more flesh weight on their tray will survive. Eddie cuts fat from his torso, but Simone chops off her entire left arm, killing Eddie. After being released from the glass box, Mark Hoffman  is called to the scene of the opening trap by Dan Erickson , who found Peter Strahm's fingerprints around the room. He reveals that Lindsey Perez  is still alive; since they had not known who Jigsaw's accomplice was, Erickson had kept her survival a secret. After running into Pamela Jenkins , a reporter, Hoffman meets with Jill Tuck  at her clinic to inform her that he is taking control of the games. Jill gives him five envelopes containing photos of people to be tested, left to her in the box from John Kramer's  will. John had previously brought Amanda Young  to Jill, who had given up on helping Amanda, as proof that his methods worked. It is later shown that John gave Jill the key to the box at the meatpacking plant just before he was killed. William Easton , a health insurance executive, talks with his company's attorney, Debbie , about Harold Abbott , who died from an illness after his insurance policy was revoked due to an application discrepancy. He is kidnapped from his office that night and brought to an abandoned zoo, and awakens in a vise designed to tighten around his torso each time he breathes into an oxygen respirator. Hank , his janitor and a smoker, is in the same trap across from him. A videotape of John tells William that he has one hour to undergo four tests to remove bombs from his limbs, or he will lose his family. He is able to hold his breath longer than Hank, who is killed by the vise. In his second test, he must choose to save either Allen , his healthy but orphaned file clerk, or Addy , his diabetic secretary who is surrounded by family. His policy favors Allen, but he saves Addy and Allen is hanged when his platform retracts. In his third test, William is able to guide Debbie through a boiler room maze, only to learn through X-rays that the key to her device is stitched into his side. She attacks him with a saw, but is killed when the device fires a spear through her head. In his fourth test, William finds his six staff members chained to a spinning carousel. A shotgun is set to fire at them one by one, but he can save two by pushing a button to drive a spike into his hand and divert the shotgun. He chooses to save Emily and Shelby. William's progress is viewed by Brent and Tara , who awaken in a cage below the observation room. Pamela awakens in another cage on the other side. Flashbacks throughout the tests reveal that William and John met at the opening of Jill's clinic, and that John immediately found fault with William's methods, which essentially choose who lives or dies. John later went to William for coverage for a Norwegian cancer treatment and was rejected. Meanwhile, Hoffman is called away by Erickson, who informs him that abnormalities were found in Strahm's fingerprints, and that the Seth Baxter tape was retrieved, but the voice did not match Jigsaw's. Erickson and Perez bring Hoffman to the site where a technician is unscrambling the voice, where Erickson reveals that he knows of Strahm's death. The moment Hoffman's voice is unscrambled, he kills everyone in the room, plants fingerprints from Strahm's hand, retrieved after escaping the glass box, and then sets the room on fire to destroy the evidence. Upon returning to the observation room, he finds the letter he had written to Amanda to blackmail her into killing Lynn Denlon, using the knowledge that Amanda was the reason why Cecil Adams  had robbed Jill's clinic. The letter was left by Jill, who subdues Hoffman using an electric shock just as William reaches the end of the path, finding himself between the two cages. It is shown that William and Pamela are siblings, while Tara and Brent are Harold's surviving family. A videotape of John informs Tara that she can either kill William or free him using a marked switch. Brent angrily shifts the switch to "Die" when Tara is unable to do so, and William is killed when a platform of needles pierces his back and pumps hydrofluoric acid into his body. Jill restrains Hoffman and secures a newer Reverse Bear-trap to his head, and then reveals that there was a sixth envelope, which contained his photograph. She leaves him with 45 seconds but no key; he escapes his restraints by breaking his hand, and escapes the trap by lodging it into the bars of the door's window, screaming as his right cheek is torn open.
