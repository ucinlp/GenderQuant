The Stooges are "Click, Clack and Cluck", paparazzi-like photographers working for Whack Magazine  who continue to grate at their weary boss . To get them out of his hair, he sends them to Vulgaria for their next job, knowing full well that taking pictures in Vulgaria is against the law, leading to execution. The inept trio are caught once they set foot on Vulgarian soil. As the firing squad is setting up, Curly requests one last smoke, leading to him pulling out a cigar the length of a hero sandwich. The wait puts everyone to sleep, and enables the boys to escape. As they try to avoid their captors, they end up in a local cafe, in which Curly pits his wits against a strong drink, and then a defiant oyster in his stew. When the oyster works Curly's last nerve he pulls out his gun and fires at it repeatedly. This gets the attention of the guards who promptly capture the Stooges and carry them off, upside down, on the bayonets of their guns.
