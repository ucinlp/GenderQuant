Cape Verde, 1964. At the feet of a mighty volcano, the traditional Cape Verdean society is undergoing a steady change. The old land-owning aristocracy is disintegrating. A class of mulatto begins to emerge, with a trade-based financial power that threatens the landlords. A new identity arises, a mix of old and new, of African and Portuguese culture, sensual and dynamic. The songs of Cesária Évora follow this inevitable transformation with the beautiful landscape of Fogo, Cape Verde as scenary. The Island of Contenda was the first feature film to be produced with the financial support of the Cape Verde national film institute  that no longer existshttp://www.expressodasilhas.sapo.cv/pt/noticias/go/portugal--leao-lopes-apresenta-qilheu-de-contendaq-em-odivela.
