The story begins three days after the events of the first film. A farmer, Jack Taggart, Sr.  is putting up fence posts while his son, Jack Jr.  is repairing their car. Billy Taggart  sets up scarecrows in the farm's cornfield. One of the scarecrows in the field begins to move on its own. Billy runs to get his brother, but the "scarecrow" comes to life and pounces on him. Jack Sr. and Jack Jr chase after Billy and his captor until the "scarecrow" sprouts its wings and disappears into the sky with Billy. A high school basketball team, their coaches and cheerleaders become stranded on a highway. After failing to call for help for several hours, they decide to drive back on the remaining tires. As night approaches, one of the girls, Minxie , has a mysterious dream about Billy Taggart and Darry Jenner  who are silently and frantically trying to warn her about the Creeper , who she sees as a black silhouette, tossing a shuriken. It hits the tire, deflating it. The teens are rushed back in the bus. The Creeper returns, taking the driver. The remaining coach asks the teens what they saw: "She flew away". As everyone begins losing their control, the coach prepares to look around, until the Creeper grabs him with its feet and flies off with the coach. Meanwhile, Jack and his son weld a home-made harpoon-gun to their truck and make harpoons to shoot with it; they're heading out to avenge Billy. In the meantime, the teens on the bus are toyed with by the Creeper; it picks out the kids it wants to eat, making them increasingly paranoid. Minxie falls unconscious, having another dream, where Darry's spirit tells her everything about the Creeper. Waking up, she tells them what she learned, forcing them to try radioing for help. The Taggerts had answered them, telling them that he's on his way. The teens celebrate the good news, but the Creeper attacks one of them , trying to pull his head through the roof. Luckily, another teen uses a javelin  to impale the creature through his head; this forces it to tear the javelin out along with the left side of its head. Wounded, the Creeper flies up into the sky, only to crash back down into the bus, jamming the doors shut. Its wing crashes through the roof of the bus, grabbing one of the teens and eating his head. Decapitating himself, the Creeper regrow his head and takes off. One of the teens, now overwhelmed with fear, decides to toss everyone the Creeper picked for his menu off the bus. However, EVERYONE gets off the bus, deciding to look for help. The Creeper was waiting for them; he takes out two teens while they scatter. The Taggerts find Minxie, who tells them about the Creeper's near-invincibility; they have her lead them back to bus anyway. Bucky returns to the bus to find two others the Creeper didn't pick, hiding there; they keep their distance as the Creeper will show up to get him. Just as they thought, the Creeper tries pulling Bucky through the hole in the roof, but the Taggarts reach the bus and scare the Creeper by flashing their headlights. Jack Sr. fires a harpoon made with a knife the Creeper left behind, during his abduction of Billy, at the beast, landing a direct hit in its left shoulder; he meant to hit the Creeper's heart. However, the Creeper removes the harpoon and tosses back at him, nearly killing Jack Jr. The Creeper makes another attack on the bus, but Jack Sr. harpoons it again , knocking it into the distance. An enraged Creeper flies up into the sky once more, shredding his disguise off for better mobility. The sheer force of the creature's pull on the rope tears it through the roof of the bus. The Taggerts abandon their vehicle just as the rope causes it to overturn; the Creeper leaves them alone, heading off to find the other teens. Three teens find an abandoned truck. The teens take the truck, only to be chased by the Creeper. However, the teen driving the truck  cleverly steps on the brakes just as the Creeper reaches the teen in back; the creature flies through the window, causing the truck to overturn. Izzy climbs out from the wreckage while the other teen wakes up, finding his leg badly injured. The truck explodes, waking up the Creeper, who has also survived. It smells the fear of the nearby teen, preparing to go after him; however, it finds it's missing both wings, along with an arm and leg. It "leap frogs" after the teen, pouncing on him. As the Creeper is about to eat the teen to replace his lost limbs, Jack Sr. shoots the Creeper in the head. The Creeper is unable to defend itself as Jack Sr. stabs it in the heart 31 times with a harpoon. The Creeper apparently succumbs to its wounds, with its "face wings" closing over its entire face. Minxie explains that the Creeper didn't die; its time ran out, so the Creeper is in hibernating until another 23 Springs pass. A skeptical Jack Sr. stabs the Creeper once more and, upon seeing no reaction, believes that Minxie is wrong: "Looks dead to me." Over the next 23 years, Jack Sr. has stitched together the damaged corpse of the Creeper and presents it as a roadside tourist attraction. People come from all over the area to pay $5 and see the legendary "Bat Out of Hell", paying $10 for a picture; crows are still attracted to the monster. The harpoon gun, always loaded and ready to fire, is aimed at the creature's chest. Jack Sr., now very much older, appears to be waiting for something that will happen in "three more days, give or take a day or two"; the first day of spring and the day the Creeper will awaken.
