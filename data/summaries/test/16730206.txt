Destiny. Is it beyond our control? Or do we make our own? These questions and other musings about the past and the future set the tone as we sail into the yearâ€™s most anticipated film about love and life. Six people are brought together on a seven-day cruise that will change their lives forever: * A hopeless romantic  searches for the right man for her, while dreaming of becoming a singer. * A successful businessman  searches for the truth about a woman from his past. * A senior housekeeper  finds out that it is never too late to find true love. * A young waiter  finds the woman of his dreams, but she is beyond his reach. * A young brat  finds out that love does not have to be as complicated as her love-hate relationship with her mother. * And a sexy lounge singer  searches for the perfect man who will keep his promises and who will never leave her. This comedy-romance-drama-musical will make you swoon, cry, laugh, and fall in love all over again. While it takes you to three continents around the world , it is nevertheless an intimate film about searching for love, following your dreams, and making your own destiny.
