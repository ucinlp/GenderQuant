Shemp has been ill with a toothache for quite some time. The Stooges' friend Claude , gives Moe and Larry some specific instructions on how to cure the toothache, which, of course, they misinterpret every which way possible. After finally yanking the troublesome tooth, Claude suggests they take Shemp on a camping trip for a little R&R. Since the Stooges do not own a car, Claude offers to sell them a car that turns out to be a "lemon". The trio run into a series of mishaps trying to get the car to work, including a flat tire that lands Moe's foot under the car. After all is said and done, Shemp realizes that he feels better after all.
