L'amour fou follows the dissolution of the marriage between Claire, an actress , and Sebastien, her director . It is black and white with two different film gauges  employed at different times throughout the film. The film focuses on a long cycle of self-destruction in Claire and Sebastien's relationship. The central event in the film's narrative is a three-week period of preparation by a theater group for a production of Racine's version of Andromaque. A crew films the preparations of the theater company in handheld 16&nbsp;mm, while the rest of the film is shot in 35&nbsp;mm. This framework allows Rivette to focus on the act of direction, in the formation of an artwork and the dissolution of a relationship.
