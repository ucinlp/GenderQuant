The movie opens in the swamplands that Kermit the Frog calls home. He recaps an adventure about his childhood where he enjoyed a serene amphibian's life with his buddies Croaker the Frog and Goggles the Toad, enduring the occasional unpleasant altercation with an aggressive bullfrog named Blotch. Despite his tranquil existence, Kermit can't help but wonder what else the world has to offer and what lies beyond the swamp, but the sentiment is not shared by his companions, and a swamp alligator named Arnie warns Kermit that to venture into the human world is to court disaster. After a pet store owner named Wilson  spots Goggles and Blotch and snatches them up so he can sell them however, Kermit and Croaker have no choice but to venture forth in order to save their friends. Along the way, Kermit and Croaker meet a stray dog named Pilgrim , whose knowledge of the outside world proves vital in helping them reach the pet shop. Along the way, Kermit discovers the excitement of the movies, the power of a wishing star, and even what it's like to fly. Meanwhile, the other animals at the store manage to convince Goggles in a lively musical number that being sold to someone as a pet isn't such a bad idea. What they don't realize, however, is a high school teacher named Hugo Krassman  and his cheerfully inept assistant Mary  will be collecting all the frogs for use as dissection fodder in Krassman's biology class. In a daring rescue, Kermit manages to free Goggles from the dissection table and fend off Dr. Krassman using some swashbuckling techniques he picked up at the movie theater. Despite the warnings that Kermit should never talk to humans, Kermit addresses Krassman directly, asking him to please release the frogs. This fortuitous decision reveals that Krassman had encountered another frog who spoke to him as a child, only to be laughed at by his entire science class. With the truth at long last revealed that frogs can indeed talk, Krassman frees all the frogs and enables Kermit and his friends to return home. Back in the present, Kermit enters the swamp to meet up with his old friends.
