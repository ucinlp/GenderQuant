 Catholic girl Patsy lives in an orphanage in Quebec. After the orphanage burns down due to Patsy's arson, she finds a new home with the McChesney couple, who live in Protestant Ottawa. While Victoria is excited about the new family member, Patrick reacts reluctantly as he is a candidate for the Parliament in Ottawa. After Victoria overcomes a case of mycetism caused by Patsy collecting poisonous mushrooms, Victoria is suspected of causing the flame cleaning of the local school. The examination of the case finds no concrete evidence against Patsy. McChesney declares to give up his candidature in order to accept Patsy as his daughter. Patsy, however, flees. In the meantime, her innocence is proven. Patsy is found again and accepted in the McChesney home as their daughter.
