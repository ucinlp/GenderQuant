The film's action takes place almost entirely on the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits train the Rome Express, travelling between Paris and Rome. Before the journey starts, a valuable painting by Van Dyck has been stolen from an art gallery in Paris. Zurta, a mysterious and sinister character, boards the train with an accomplice to search for the stolen painting, which he believes to be in the possession of Poole. Poole attempts to avoid being found by hiding in his sleeping compartment. As Zurta searches for the painting, he is soon involved with several other travellers, including an adulterous couple, an English golf-bore, a wealthy but tight-fisted businessman and his brow-beaten secretary/valet, a French police officer and an American film star with her manager/publicist. The painting is discovered by accident and passes through the hands of several people on the train, but after Zurta kills Poole, he is confronted by the police inspector. Attempting to escape, he leaps from the train and  is killed. The painting is presumed to be returned to the owners.
