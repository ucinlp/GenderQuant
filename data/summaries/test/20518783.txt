The park ranger at Niagara Falls boasts about his impeccable record of enforcing the prohibition related to going over the falls in a barrel. Woody is in the crowd and instantly decides to attempt it. The ranger tries endlessly to prevent Woody from succeeding, but ends up in a barrel going over the falls himself each and every time, much to the delight of onlooking tourists, who cheer loudly. Eventually, the ranger takes his district with him. The end result has the entire crew going over the falls in barrels. Finally, Woody joins the ranger, dressed up as a police officer, and gives him a ticket for going down the falls in barrel.
