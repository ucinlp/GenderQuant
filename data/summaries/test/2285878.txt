{{plot}}  In the land of Earthsea, a young wizard named Ged, the son of a blacksmith, is having visions about a priestess named Tenar. The Kargide king, Tygath, wants to unite the land and release diabolical demons called Nameless Ones so that he can learn the secret of their immortality. He learns of the legend of a great wizard  who will rise up and could be a threat to his plans. So he sends some men to attack Ged’s village on the island of Gont. Ged uses a spell to create mist around the Kargides, causing them to fall over a cliff. However, one of them knocks Ged off the cliff with him, sending both falling to their deaths. Tygath tries to convince the high priestess, Thar, to help him release the Nameless Ones, but she refuses. So, his lover, Kossil, tricks another priestess, Rosa, into poisoning her, in the hopes that she will name her as her successor and tell her the incantation. A magus named Ogion arrives at Ged’s village and is able to revive Ged. He gives Ged his true name of “Sparrowhawk”, which contains his power, and takes him to train him. However, Ged wants to learn magic quicker, so Ogion sends him to a magic school on the island of Roke. There, he meets Jasper, the school bully, and becomes friends with another student, Vetch. Ged shapeshifts into a hawk to compete with Jasper, who then challenges him to raise a spirit from the dead. While attempting to do so, he accidentally releases a Nameless One. The archmagus of Roke tells him that this Nameless One is extremely powerful and will become The Gebbeth, who will hunt him down and try to kill him. He tells him to go somewhere where The Gebbeth will not expect to look for him, until he can find his true name and destroy him. Tygath attempts to invade Roke, but the archmagus confronts them. He warns them not to attack. However, Jasper helps Tygath gain entry to Roke, and Tygath stabs the archmagus. As Ged travels with a man he met on a boat during the trip to Roke, the man turns out to be The Gebbeth, who attacks him. Ged shapeshifts into a bird and flies away, but collapses, where Ogion finds him and takes him to his house. He tells him that The Gebbeth will chase him wherever he wants to, and that he should go toward him instead. Before he leaves, Ged accepts Ogion as his true master. On a boat, he encounters The Gebbeth attempts to drown him, however, The Gebbeth escapes. The Gebbeth goes to a bar and kills a few people. Vetch, who is now a magus, uses his magic to find the murderer, giving the appearance of Ged. He goes after him and uses a magic spell on him. Once Vetch realizes Ged is not possessed by The Gebbeth, he takes him to his house, and they decide to find The Gebbeth. Upon arrival, they are attacked by a dragon, but Ged uses the dragon’s true name to bind him and ask him three questions. The dragon tricks him into wasting his first question, and with his second he finds The Gebbeth’s location. The dragon tells him that with the Amulet of Peace, which was broken into two pieces, he could save Earthsea, so Ged instead asks where the pieces of the amulet are. Meanwhile, Thar appoints the pure Tenar as her successor, and gives her the incantation. Tygath is furious with Kossil. She kills Rosa, who was beginning to suspect that Kossil poisoned Thar, and frames Tenar for it. Tenar is imprisoned in the labyrinth. Ged and Vetch go to Roke to find the amulet. Roke is now under Jasper’s control, but when Jasper leads them into his room, he reveals himself to be the archmagus in disguise. He reveals that an object Ged was given by his first teacher back at the village is one half of the amulet. The other is at Tygath’s castle. Ged and Vetch sneak through the castle, using magic to avoid being detected by Kargides. Vetch gets through a wall by shapeshifting into a rat, but Ged is captured and brought before Thar, who mistakes him for an evil wizard due to his sneaking around and has him imprisoned in the Labyrinth. Immediately after, Kossil continues asking who Thar’s successor is going to be, and Thar realizes that Kossil killed Rosa, before dying of the poison. In the labyrinth, Ged is locked in the cell next to Tenar. He is able to break out and open Tenar’s cell, and they recognize each other from their visions. Then, Tenar is brought before Kossil, who threatens to kill her unless she reveals the incantation. Tenar refuses, and Kossil tries to kill her, but is stabbed to death by Tygath as punishment for her failure. Tygath has Tenar lead him toward the tomb of Atuan. Vetch finds his way to the tomb first and is killed by The Gebbeth. Ged encounters Tygath and fights him, but Tygath has the upper hand, so Ged runs into the tomb where he encounters The Gebbeth. Ged comes to the realization that The Gebbeth’s true name is Sparrowhawk, because he is the darkness in him, and Ged accepts this now. The Gebbeth is absorbed into Ged to make him whole again, and enabling him to gain the upper hand on Tygath when he enters the tomb. Tygath threatens to kill Tenar unless Ged makes her release the Nameless Ones. Ged, who knows that this is the right thing to do, tells Tenar to speak the incantation. The Nameless Ones are released, and kill Tygath before they fly away to wreak havoc on Earthsea. Ged is able to revive Vetch the same way Ogion revived him, and then reveals a part of the key to the tomb's door to be the second half of the amulet. Ged and Tenar put the Amulet of Peace together, destroying the Nameless Ones and restoring peace to Earthsea.
