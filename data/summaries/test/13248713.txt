Three decorated Navy pilots finagle a four-day leave in San Francisco. They land a posh suite at a hotel where Commander Andy Crewson , a master of procurement, arranges to populate it with wine, women and song.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/80435/Kiss-Them-for-Me/ Blonde bombshell Alice Kratzner  is one of these women, lured to the suite under the false pretense that Crewson has a stash of nylon stockings. Once there, she is naturally attracted to Crewson, but later turns her attention to Lieutenant McCann , a married man who also is in the process of running for a Congressional seat back home in Connecticut. If he is elected, McCann can leave the Navy immediately and return to civilian life. Lieutenant Wallace  tries to get the three pilots, including "Mississip,"  to make morale-raising speeches at the plants of shipyard magnate Eddie Turnbill , so that Turnbill will vouch for the men with the Navy and also to grease a popular job for himself upon leaving the service. Crewson and his cohorts, however, are physically and mentally exhausted from the war and simply want to enjoy a few days away from it. Suffering from combat stress and confronted with a number of reminders of the horrors of war, Crewson tries to amuse himself by making a play for Turnbill's attractive fianc√©e, Gwinneth Livingston . She resists his advances at first, but ultimately throws her engagement ring in Turnbill's face. Crewson declares his love for her shortly before he and his mates board a plane leaving San Francisco to return to duty.
