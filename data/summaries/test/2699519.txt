 David Walsh  is a bank employee whose day begins badly when he gets fired from his dream job and dumped by his fiancée Sara Goodwin  the day after their engagement party is crashed by his best friend, Jack . Jack tries to tell him it's for the best, that David was headed down the wrong path, and has a hooker show up at his apartment to console him, only for her to steal his car. The next day, David goes back to the bank with a gun in his waistband. He surreptitiously makes his way into his previous boss' office, where he pulls out the gun and threatens to end his life. Though intimidated, the boss calls him out and Walsh, not wanting blood on his hands, pistol-whips him, leaving his office only to find the bank being robbed. A sequence shows him killing the robbers single-handedly, but this was shown to be a daydream and he gets down. When one of the robbers take his co-worker Wendy , he shoots him and saves her, but is shot and tackled into the getaway vehicle before they make their escape. A montage shows various people's reactions after the incident, including his ex-fiancée, who is crying uncontrollably. It then shows a burning van, with a reporter stating that following dental records, it was proven to be Walsh's body. This turns into a complex series of twists; the robbery was part of a two-year plan to erase David's identity and leave him and his friends filthy rich. Dave, Jack, Wendy, and Eric  meet up in a motel room, prepared to divide their earnings and part ways. When Wendy leaves the room, Dave kills Jack . Wendy kills Dave and runs off with the money to pick up Sara  with whom she's involved in a lesbian relationship. After the credits, Sarah and Wendy's car is shown to be hit by a bus, killing them both.
