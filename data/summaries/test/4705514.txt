Artie Lewis  is an NYPD detective who believes in his work, loves his wife Rita , and stands by his partner Stevie Diroma . After a hard, violent day at work Artie and Stevie reassure each other that, though battered and bruised, they are "still alive". Stevie is a widower with three young daughters. He is killed in the line of duty by Mickey Garrett  during a hostage situation. Stevie's daughters Marian , Barbara , and Carol  are left orphans with no relatives to turn to. Artie and Rita take them in and want to adopt them, but Child Welfare Service decides that their apartment is too small for three children, and Barbara is a diabetic who needs insulin shots. Artie needs to buy a house, and the house he has chosen requires a $25,000 down payment that he doesn't have. Desperate, Artie grabs his gun and a ski mask and robs drug kingpin Beniamino Rios , who was, in a way, involved in Stevie's death. Artie uses $25,000.00 of the take for a down payment on the house, and he gives the rest to Father Wills , who runs a local makeshift shelter. However, Beniamino's girlfriend Grace De Feliz  is actually an undercover narcotics agent who suspects Artie, but his chief defends him as one of his best officers and no action is taken against him. The junkie who tipped Artie off to where Beniamino kept his money breaks down under Beniamino's questioning and gives Artie up to the drug lords. Beniamino kidnaps Artie and tortures him to try to find out what he did with his money. Knowing Artie will not talk and will soon be killed, Grace blows her cover and helps him. Together they are forced to kill Beniamino and his colleagues. Artie's co-workers make up the $25,000 he stole, Grace refuses to testify against him, and the government walks away from the case to avoid compromising their agents in the field. Artie's boss, lieutenant Danny Quinn , understanding his motives, short-staffed for good detectives and out of loyalty to Artie's slain partner, whose kids will be homeless if Artie goes to jail, tells Artie that no charges will be filed against him and allows him to remain on the force. Artie calls Rita to tell her they and the girls are "still alive".
