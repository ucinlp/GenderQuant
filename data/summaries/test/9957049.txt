Living in Manhattan, Peter Wilson  is a sarcastic near-sighted cartoonist, author and swinging bachelor. He detests dogs and children. Although he also disagrees with many values of women, Peter is a commitment-phobe as he much prefers women who come and go very briefly in his life. At the office of his eye surgeon, Peter bumps into a leggy eye-catching brunette named Theresa 'Terri' Kozlenko . He likes her very much but he doesn't immediately realise that she is a single mother to three children with a scowling dog until she invites him back to her flat. They build up a close relationship that shows they are a perfect match as Terri becomes the only woman prepared to put up with Peter's strong views day-by-day. Their relationship soon becomes more passionate . When she rejects his idea of living a life of purely sleeping together only at his bachelor pad , he reluctantly proposes to her and eventually moves in with her at her flat. They get married but then her rogue ex-husband Stephen Kozlenko  appears on the scene to spend more time with their children. Stephen and Peter clash at first but they soon become good drinking friends, much to the disapproval of Terri. Peter's eyesight gradually gets more worse over time and his once-popular work as a cartoonist begins to receive criticism from his bumbling boss Howard Mann . A serious operation to possibly cure Peter's problem arises, in which he tries to keep a secret from Terri so as to not worry her but a very upset Howard gets hysterical and therefore ruins Peter's attempts to make up a story about working away from home on a book. Terri then tells him that she knew all along that Peter was really going blind from the first day she met him.
