Set in the 1940s in Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, it tells the story of a young girl living in a coal mining town where the death of men from accidents in "the pit"  has become almost routine. Margaret MacNeil  has already lost her father and an older brother and for her, life alone would be preferable to marrying a mine workerâ€”that is until the charming Neil Currie  shows up. Against the wishes of her hard-bitten mother  they marry, but before long financial woes lead to his doing what every other uneducated young man does in the town: take a job underground. His death in the mine drives Margaret to a mental breakdown and in her surreal world she decides to create a "special" museum to the memories of all those who have died as a result of the horrific mining conditions.
