Ngau's grandfather was a hon-kan during the Second Sino-Japanese War and had murdered a man called Keung and did not spare Keung's family too. Keung became a vengeful ghost after death and he sought revenge on Ngau. Ngau's wife was killed by Keung and Ngau did not want to lose his son, Fai. He seeks help from the expert ghostbuster Mrs Bud Lung, who tells him to operate a food stall at night to attract some ghost patrons and ask them to protect his family from Keung. When Fai grows older, he is seduced by Sally Li, who is trying to trick him into selling his father's land. If the land is sold, the ghost patrons can no longer protect Ngau's family. Fai steals his father's stamp after knocking him unconscious and signs the contract with Sally, only to realise that she had lied to him. Even though the contract is destroyed by Ngau's friends later, it is too late as Keung had already caused Fai to die in a car accident. Out of love for his son, Ngau sacrifices himself to appease Keung and Fai is brought back to life. In memory of his father, Fai and his wife continue to operate the stall to serve ghost patrons.
