 Don Maxwell  is a former vaudeville impersonator who is working as the lab assistant to Dr. Meirschultz , a mad scientist attempting to bring the dead back to life. When Don kills Meirschultz, he attempts to hide his crime by "becoming" the doctor, taking over his work and copying his appearance and manner. In the process, he slowly goes insane. The "doctor" treats a mental patient, Buckley , but accidentally injects him with adrenaline, which causes him to go into violent fits. Buckley's wife  discovers the body of the real doctor, and blackmails Don into turning her husband into a zombie. The ersatz doctor turns the tables on her by manipulating her into fighting with his estranged wife , a former showgirl. When the cat-breeding neighbor Goof sees what's going on, he calls the police, who stop the fight and, following the sound of Satan the cat, find the body of the real doctor hidden behind a brick wall.<ref name82832&category=Full Synopsis Full synopsis]
