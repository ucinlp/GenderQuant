The film is set in an unspecified time on Earth when the descendants of a genetically enhanced race created by mankind have control of the planet. Known as the "ghen" - a derivative of the word "generic" which humans labeled them as -- the genetically superior race rule from their underground utopia, Hollow Earth. Baron Crecilius Pryme, a charismatic political from Ume City, sets out to convince his fellow ghen that what remains of the human race must be eradicated because he believes they are forming a crusade to attack the ghen. Crecilius shrewdly moves his brother, Aiden Pryme, into his deadly group of private soldiers known as "The Ministers", who hunt and abuse humans above ground. Meanwhile, a human woman known as "The Channeler", is communicating with the "Kalendoah", a group of non-physical beings of infinite intelligence who promise there is hope and a coming savior. Below ground, Crecilius has heard rumblings of a woman offering hope to mankind, and who has the ability to cure the sick and revive the dead, and sends his Ministers to find her. But Crecilius finds he has even more to worry about when his mother, Hannalin Pryme, takes a stand against his genocide of the human race, and reveals a long-buried secret that will forever change the destinies of the Pryme family.
