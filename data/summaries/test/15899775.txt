The Federal Aviation Authority shut down the skies over the United States, so, suddenly, more than 200 aircraft flying over the Atlantic at the time had to find new places to land. Thirty-nine of those flights made their way to Gander, Newfoundland, and on that day 6,600 people descended on a town of 9,000. Mike Stiven  is a young air traffic controller who falls in love with a woman from one of the diverted planes . Samuel Stearn  is a New Yorker desperate to contact his missing son, who was in the World Trade Center. Marion Price  and Andrew Tyler ([[Colin Buchanan  are passengers who find solace in each other for their depressing lives.
