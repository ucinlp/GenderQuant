Megan Gordon  is a shy Goth girl who moves into a new neighborhood from Los Angeles with her recently widowed mother Susan . In her new school, Megan does not make friends, and is taunted mercilessly by her peers, apart from Nikki Chandler  and handsome jock Ron . On moving into her new home, Megan finds an antique framed mirror in her room which belonged to the original owners of the house, and despite an attempt to remove it from the house, it mysteriously appears back in place. Slowly, Megan comes to realise that the mirror can grant her special powers, enabling her to have vengeance on her tormentors. However, the antiques dealer who was in charge of the house clearance finds an old diary that holds the ominous secret of the mirror's past: It describes how the mirror is possessed by a demonic force within it, which has the power to grant requests at a deadly price...and the fate of the previous owner's sister. As it begins to give Megan the ability to take her revenge on her persecutors, she slowly becomes dependent on the mirror, and soon it takes her over. As the death toll mounts, both Megan's enemies and her friends suffer as the demonic force reaches out and grows in strength. Armed only with a dagger and a vague knowledge of how the demonic mirror can be stopped, Nikki sets out to confront Megan and her mirror, before it is too late.
