Fred and Wilma's marriage is in serious jeopardy. After years of Wilma putting up with her husband's lazy, self-centered loitering, she hopes that a second honeymoon in Rockapulco  will finally restore the passion in the relationship; Fred, in the meantime, looks at the idea as another excuse for a personal vacation and takes it for granted. Meanwhile, a professional thief succeeds in acquiring a rare diamond, but he loses possession of it when his handbag ends up getting switched with Wilma's handbag, forcing the thief to woo the frustrated Mrs. Flintstone in an effort to reclaim the diamond, which follows up to leading a worried Fred to reevaluate his own conduct and feelings towards Wilma before he "loses her" for good. The two eventually discover the thief's true purpose and reunite together to save the day and restore their love.
