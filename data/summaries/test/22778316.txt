After a car accident, two teenagers are left stranded in rural Greece. Charlotte has a deep desire to find connection, but hides behind a sullen disposition and her new-found sexual power. Sye, her recent stepbrother, is introverted, hiding behind his camera and caustic wit. As the two wander the dusty roads and staggering beauty of Greece, they come across Benerji, an expatriate American. With no other alternative, they reluctantly accept him as their guide. The three begin an adventurous journey toward the mystic waters on the sacred Mount Parnonas. Their journey takes them through a landscape both ancient and modern. Events force them to confront the truth of their past and the frightening, beautiful reality of their present.
