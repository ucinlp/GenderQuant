An expensive prize bull is bought at an auction by Charles Ellsworth , who has come to purchase stock for the wealthy Texas rancher Alexander Bowen . Sam Burnett  is hired to transport the bull to Bowen's ranch. Martha Price , the bull's original owner, is told by daughter Hilary  about a conversation she overheard between Burnett and two men working for competing rancher John Taylor . Burnett has made a deal with Taylor to kidnap the bull. One of Taylor's men, Deke Simons , gets into a fight with Burnett in the saloon. Price, witnessing the brawl, comes to trust Burnett. They and her daughter travel cross country to transport the bull. One night while Price and Burnett are brewing coffee over the campfire, a shot knocks over the coffee pot. Burnett knows this is a signal from Taylor's men. Just before dawn, Hilary catches Burnett as he is about to hand over the bull. He denies her accusations, waking her mother to prove he was innocent. Once again, Price gives Burnett the benefit of the doubt. Taylor's men find a fence which has been hacked through to make way for Price's wagon. They conclude that Burnett must have double-crossed them. Simons, determined to catch up with Burnett, shoots a companion and rides on after the wagon. In a canyon, Burnett runs into Jamie Bowen , Alexander's son, who has stolen a herd of his father's longhorn cattle and is running away to start his own ranch. Simons catches up and shoots a cowhand, setting off a stampede. Jamie tries to escape but falls in the path of the charging cattle. Battered and unconscious, Jamie is carried by Burnett back to the wagon. Simons is there holding Price and her daughter hostage. Simons demands the money that Burnett was paid by Taylor for the bull. Simons also demands Price's money, but while distracted, Burnett is able to take his rifle. Simons mounts and gallops away. Burnett follows. As horses collide, Simons falls onto a sharp rock and is killed instantly. Burnett returns with the money, but Price berates him for his dishonesty and the trouble he has caused. After a few days of travelling with Bowen's son in tow, they reach their destination, his father's ranch.
