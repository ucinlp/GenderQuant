Alan Duckworth  is a socially awkward fourteen year-old who is obsessed with cricket and Ann Lawton. Alan daydreams throughout his day showing up late for school and making little academic progress. He becomes friends with the groundsman Tommy  who he sees as some sort of 'war hero'. Alan often follows Tommy around telling him how Tommy helped to win the war while making predictions about what the world will be like now the war is won. Among other things, Alan predicts there will be no more wars, everyone will speak Esperanto and everyone, regardless of race or creed, will have a Teasmade. Miss Land , meanwhile, is worried she is pregnant with Tommy's baby, something that would result in her having to resign from her job as an English teacher. While his friends are all interested in sex, which Alan refers to as 'the other thing', he is purely focused on kissing Ann Lawton. Ann, however, is not well regarded by Alan's friends as she is very strait-laced. When Miss Land casts them together in the school play, Alan and Ann have to kiss.
