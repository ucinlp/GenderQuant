A vagabond family composed of Pop Kwimper , his son Toby , and various "adopted" children, including nineteen-year-old Holly Jones , is traveling in Florida when Pop drives onto an as-yet-unopened section of highway. When the car runs out of gas, Holly persuades Toby to persuade Pop to take up residence on the land next to the road. A chance encounter with an avid fisherman  gives Holly an idea. They build a thriving business catering to sports fishermen. Trouble soon follows. Toby rejects the advances of amorous social worker Alisha Claypoole , who goes to court to have the children taken away in revenge. Also, her government official boyfriend considers the squatters' home to be an eyesore and wants to evict them. Finally, since the area is outside the jurisdiction of any law enforcement, two gamblers  soon set up a casino in a trailer, and Toby has to deal with their armed thugs. In the end, Toby's earthy wits win over the judge and the family returns to its new land and home. Holly also gets Toby to recognize that she is a grown woman.
