The film introduces Edison Carter , a television reporter trying to expose corruption and greed. In the movie, reporter Carter discovers that his employer, Network 23, has created a new form of subliminal advertising  that can be fatal to certain viewers. While attempting to flee the network headquarters with proof, Edison suffers a serious head injury, caused by striking a low-clearance sign labelled "Max. Headroom". Believing him killed, the network's chief executive orders Bryce Lynch, an adolescent genius working as a scientist for Network 23, to digitally record Carter's mind. The recording will then be used to create a computer-based replacement for Carter in order to hide his death. However, Bryce's programme is flawed and apparently broken&nbsp;&mdash; burbling "Max Headroom" over and over again . Bryce instructs his hired goons to dispose of both Carter and his virtual clone, but they simply sell them on&nbsp;&mdash; Carter to a body bank, and the machine copy to pirate television station  owner Blank Reg. After a bit of nurturing from Reg, the resulting program achieves a somewhat eccentric life of its own, crackling out rapid fire gags, hosting his own show, and sending Reg's ratings through the roof. Meanwhile, a merely unconscious Carter escapes from becoming a premature organ donor. With the help of colleague Theora Jones , and the distraction provided by Max, Carter eventually defeats Network 23.
