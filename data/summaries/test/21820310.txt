  Inspired from Allu Arjun's Bunny. It is an action comedy film. Subhashree portrays a girl with an extremely conservative/obsessive father. Her father just can’t tolelate any other guy looking at his daughter face to face. He can not accept anybody who tries to be friend with his daughter. He terrifies, beats everybody to protect his daughter. Subhashree in the films also loves her dad but at the same time dreams about someone capable enough to challenge her dad. Who can really fight her dad for Subhashree. Here comes our hero Dev to save and love Subhashree. Challenge is definitely a love story but “action” dominates everything else. In the fear of Pooja's boyfriend, her father sends her to his father-in-law's home. But at last the couples gets married and after some years they had a son. The plot of Challenge is not an original piece of work but the smart treatment does make it engaging. At the centre of the knotty affair is Rajatava, the baap of local goondas who is obsessed with the need to shield his daughter Subhashree from male gaze. Rajatava’s men bully every boy who dares look at her, but Cupid strikes when Dev-Subhashree meet and the hero takes on the father’s might with brain and brawn. Despite the theme, which could have easily spiralled into the usual Tolly ordeal of sound and fury, Raj keeps the tenor breezy with music, humour and cute romance. Somak Mukherjee’s cinematography helps do the trick for Raj. Challenge belongs to Dev. He does set hearts aflutter. He looks good, dances well and carries off the angry young man attitude with panache. And yes, he can act too. Subhashree, sweet and sassy, plays Miss Touch-me-not with poise but a little more effort would have helped her match up to her suave and spunky hero. Rajatava looks a tad different from his other villainous roles as the story prevents him from going into the routine blood-and-gore nautanki. As the funny college principal, Kharaj is loud and theatrical but he fits into the scheme of things to make you laugh. Don’t miss little Aritra pulling out some gags in a cameo.
