Thirteen women, friends who were members of a girl's college sorority, all write to a clairvoyant "swami"  who by mail sends each a horoscope foreseeing swift doom. However, the clairvoyant is under the sway of Ursula Georgi , a half-Javanese Eurasian woman who when a student at the college was snubbed by the other women owing to her mixed-race heritage. Georgi seeks revenge by tricking the women into killing themselves or each other. She also goads the clairvoyant into killing himself by falling into the path of a subway train. The victims are set up and killed off one by one until only Laura Stanhope , living in Beverly Hills, is still alive. With the help of Laura's chauffeur Ursula tries to kill Laura's young son with both tainted candy and an explosive rubber ball, but is thwarted. A police detective catches her trying to murder Laura on a train. Ursula flees to the back of the train and jumps off to her own death.
