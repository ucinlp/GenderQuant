Loose cannon Kwak Jang-bae , a neighborhood policeman, is obsessed with his sexual prowess and continually wants to have sex with his live-in girlfriend, Ji-su , an English teacher at a private school who is bored with his macho behavior. Forthright high-school student Ju Ja-hye  sells her sweat-stained panties on the internet and wants to lose her virginity to scruffy fish-sausage seller Choi-kang Sang-du ; the older man is uninterested in her advances but Ja-hye cannot work out why. Ja-hye's mother , who sells hanbok , discovers the owner of a hardware shop opposite, Gi-bong , is into S&M and starts having sessions with him in the back of his shop, assuming a dominatrix role. Kim Gwang-rok , Ja-hye's teacher, is a married man who is secretly into wearing women's clothes when his wife is not around. When Jang-bae discovers Ji-su has ordered a vibrator, he has a major crisis over his manhood and stops sleeping with her. Meanwhile, as his neighborhood has been marked for a moral clean-up campaign by the police, it's only time before Jang-bae also bumps heads with its denizens' licentious goings-on.<ref nameElley|firstFoxy Festival|urlFilm Business Asia|date=1 September 2011}}
