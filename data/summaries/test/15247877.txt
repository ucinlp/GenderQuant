Musicardi's octogenarian widow, Ana María de los Dolores Buscaroli, called Mamá Cora by everybody , has four children: Antonio , Sergio , Emilia  and Jorge Musicardi  with whom she lives and goes through financial troubles. This situation, plus lack of space and constant generational conflicts, makes Susana  ask desperately for the siblings to take their mother with any of them for a while. Susana had a domestic problem with Mamá Cora. The first was preparing some mayo and she went to nurse her daughter leaving the ingredients alone. Mamá Cora remembered an earlier conversation about caramel custard and she thought that this concoction was to make some, innocently adding sugar, milk and eggs, causing Susana's rage. She storms into Sergio's house who's getting ready with his perfidous wife Elvira  and their daughter Matilda  to welcome, with the classic Sunday meal, newly rich Antonio  and Nora, his wife , who ascended socially and economically in unclear circumstances.  Mamá Cora's destiny is debated while lunch is burnt: Sunday raviolis and the tomato sauce made by Elvira. Noone wants to take responsibility for the old lady with the women speaking out their opinions and the men trying to maintain respect for the name of their mother. On her own, Mamá Cora, due to what happened with Susana, decides to go out and stop bothering for some hours and ends up in the house across Sergio's taking care, as a favor, of Dominga's son .  Nobody finds her and with the "disappearance" after the fight with the daughter-in-law, plus the news about a disfigured body of an old lady who committed suicide throwing herself under a train, the remorseful clan comes to conclusion that it's no other than Mamá Cora who killed herself to stop causing trouble. After double-checking with the police thanks to Antonio's "contacts", the tragedy is informed to the distant relatives and the very poor Emilia  who arrives with despair because of the terrible news. On the meantime, from Dominga's terrace, the old woman watches people coming and going in and out from Sergio and Elvira's house. Years of troubles, resentment and intrigues come up between all of them while they prepare the service for the supposed Mamá Cora. Misunderstandings follow and family's awful truths surface. In the middle of her own vigil, Mamá Cora reappears leaving everybody astonished. The family reconsiders and values the presence of its elder member while she and her friends go to the other woman's service . Susana laughs out loud in front of her disconcerted relatives; she mocks them and herself because nothing will be the same again.
