The movie opens on the lab of mad scientist Dr. VonFockingcock, testing his new invention, The Ultimate Orgasmarator, via a sex romp with his twink assistant. An aircraft attacks the lab, and the scientist and his creation are captured. In futuristic yet gothic Eros City, the local superhero Stonewall and his young sidekick Riot are introduced while chasing down and catching the villain Doctor Cocktopus. Afterward, the city's police chief informs the pair of the attack on VonFockingcock, and they determine to find the culprit, and foil what they reason must be a grand plan to wreak havoc on the city with the scientist's invention. Riot suspects master criminal Polecat, who's recently been released from prison on a legal technicality, and they raid his gay strip joint, the Kit Kat Club. The ensuing battle and sex scene with the flamboyant villain reveals that Polecat is guilty... of a completely different robbery, and knows nothing of VonFockingcock and his Orgasmarator. Stonewall then suggests local rogues gallery The Masters of Doom, and he and Riot depart for the Masters' headquarters. There, the team (Snake Johnson, Dr. Probe, The Flame, [[bondage  are brainstorming plans for "the total sexual domination of Eros City" when the heroes crash in an orgy breaks out. The experience is enjoyable for all, but again the duo have the wrong guys. They return to their base, and after a flashback details Stonewall's origin story, the pair split up and a montage sequence follows, detailing their investigations of and romps with Webmaster, Chicken Hawk, Polar Bear, and Size Queen ... exhausting all of the remaining suspects, except for the insane crime boss French Tickler. Attacking his base, they find that the Tickler is holding VonFockingcock, and planning to use the Orgazmarator to cure his sexual dysfunction and plunge the city into climax and chaos. Stonewall brings the villain to his knees, while Riot engages the henchmen, and the doctor is rescued and the plot foiled. The film ends when Stonewall and Riot flys to the reporting citing of Cockmander and Arse Lick. After the credits, the talking dildo attempts to call his mother although he doesn't have any hands.
