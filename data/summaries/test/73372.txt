The scene is all filmed from a stationary camera. On screen is a large anvil with a blacksmith behind it and one to either side . The smith in the middle uses a heated metal rod he has removed from a fire and places it on the anvil. All three begin a rhythmic hammering. After several blows the metal rod is returned to the fire. One smith pulls out a bottle of beer, and they each take a drink. Following this drink they then resume their work.{{cite web}}
