The plot revolves around a 15-year-old girl named Winnie, who is from a restrictive upper-class family. Winnie one day runs away into the forest and meets a boy named Jesse Tuck, drinking from a spring. She is then kidnapped by Jesse's elder brother. Winnie soon falls in love with Jesse and later learns that the family cannot age or be injured due to drinking water from a magical spring around a hundred years ago. As the search for Winnie continues, the Tucks decide to leave the area and invite Winnie to join them. Winnie is forced to decide whether to drink from the spring and live forever, or live a mortal existence. She decides that despite the love she and Jesse share, her presence will only endanger the Tucks and she chooses to stay behind. After many years, Jesse returns to the tree where the spring used to be, and it is revealed that Winnie chose to never drink from the spring and she lived a long and charitable life.
