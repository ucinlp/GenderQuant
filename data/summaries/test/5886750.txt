Fed up with spring cleaning, Mole ventures out of his underground home. He goes for a walk in the countryside and soon comes to a river where he meets and befriends Ratty . Rat takes Mole on a picnic and they briefly meet Badger and try to strike up a conversation with him, but he just mutters "Hmmm! Company!" and walks off home. Rat starts to warn Mole of the Wild Wood and its inhabitants, but they are interrupted by the arrival of the Chief weasel and his henchman. While the Chief distracts them, his henchmen steals a jar of potted meat and they make their getaway. Rat takes Mole to visit their friend Toad at Toad Hall and Toad asks them to come with him on a caravan trip on the Open Road. Rat really misses his home on the river but does not want to disappoint his friends. On the Open Road disaster strikes as a passing motorcar sends the caravan into a ditch. Toad suddenly decides he no longer wants to travel by horse and cart and thinks that motor cars are the only way to travel. Rat and Mole can do nothing but look on as Toad buys and then almost immediately crashes his cars one after another. By now, Rat and Mole are extremely worried and they decide to Call on Badger to see if he has any suggestions, If there's anyone Toad will listen to, it's Badger. Mole decides to go alone to the wild wood to see Badger, and asks a weasel for directions to Badger's house, but he tells Mole the wrong way to go and he becomes scared and lost. Rat soon notices Mole's absence and finds a note written by Mole telling him where he has gone. Rat takes some pistols and a cudgel and hurries along to the wild wood to find him. After Rat finds Mole, they Literally stumble across Badger's house  and rat knocks on the door. Badger, annoyed at his relaxing night being disturbed, opens the door and gets ready to tell off whoever it is who has interrupted his rest, but on seeing that it is Rat and Mole outside, he lets them in. They warm themselves in front of the fire and Badger offers them them each a hot drink. They discuss Toad's careless driving. The next morning they turn up at Toad Hall and try to tell Toad that what he is doing is wrong, and attempt to make him promise that he will never go near a motor car again, but Toad won't listen to Badger's advice and the three lock Toad in his bedroom. Toad feigns illness and asks Rat to fetch a lawyer. Toad then escapes and Rat, Badger and Mole chase Toad but can't find him. Toad stops a motorist "Reggie" and his wife "Rosemary," tricks them and steals their car, and shouts insults at a policeman, calling him "Fat face!". Meanwhile Mole becomes homesick and he and Rat visit Mole End and spend Christmas there. Some Caroling field mice turn up and after they have finish their song, Rat and Mole invite them inside for a drink, but they don't have very good news to share. Toad has been arrested. Toad is sentenced to; "12 months for the theft, three years for furious driving, and fifteen years for the cheek", with another year added for "being vain!" The Jailer's Daughter feels sorry for Toad and helps him escape by disguising him as a "Washerwoman". Toad acts his way as the humble "washerwoman" into a train driver at a local railway giving him a free ride home, but it isn't long until another train full of Police; Reggie, Rosemary, the Magistrate and the Clerk are after him. Toad is found out but the engine driver still lets him escape. Toad calls in at Rat's on the way home and Rat tells him the Weasels have over thrown Badger and taken over Toad Hall. Toad is upset after losing his ancestral home but Badger has a plan. The next night, the friends sneak through the secret tunnel and fight the weasels. But he manages to fall on top of the Chief Weasel and knock him unconscious. After victory, Badger, Mole, and Ratty settle down and think of the peaceful future, until Toad flies by in his new "Flying Machine". Differences between the Novel and the Feature Film. 1. When Mole goes to row Ratty's boat - In the book they fall into the river. In the film they remain dry. 2. The Picnic - In the book Otter joins them. In the film their picnic is disturbed by the weasels. 3. In the book the weasels really only have a small role. They take over Toad Hall and when the four friends go into battle for Toad Hall the weasels just run away. In the film they are depicted as more evil and sinister. They block road signs when Toad is driving his motor cars to make him crash. They petrify Mole in the Wild Wood to try and stop him from finding Badger's house and getting Badger's help to stop Toad's motoring insanity and they are also in the jury of the court room when Toad is being sentenced. And in the Battle for Toad hall they fight Toad and his friends. Though of course the friends win. 4. Three chapters of the book are omitted from the film: "The Further Adventures of Toad", "Wayfarer's All" and "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn." These chapters were adapted as TV episodes in the first series of The Wind in the Willows. 5. The character of Otter is not included, though he is in the Television series.
