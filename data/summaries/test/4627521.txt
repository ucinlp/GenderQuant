The film is narrated in a non-linear fashion, with the use of several multiple flashbacks. In the opening scene, a dreaded underworld don is brutally hacked to death by unknown assailants. The police arrive at the crime scene and arrest the unknown assailant revealed as the superstar hero of the movie. The murder is revealed to be the handiwork of a novice, Madesha alias Jogi, played by Kannada superstar Shivarajkumar who works in a roadside tea stall. In the meantime, news about the murder reaches the echelons of the underworld. A rival gang of the slain don bails out Madesha from the lock-up and requests him to be their associate. Madesha rejects their offer and returns to his tea stall. An inquisitive trainee journalist Nivedhitha  is eager to know about Madesha and requests an appointment with him. Despite trailing Madesha for several days, she is unable to interview him. Subsequently, she meets an old woman  from a remote village, who has come in search of her lost son. After listening to her story, Nivedhitha assures her that she will locate her son. In a flashback, it is revealed that the old lady's son is none other than Madesha. Madesha originally hailed from a village called Singanallur, North Karnataka and lived with his parents. His father  earned his living as a Jogi - a wandering minstrel, who went from one household to another and collected alms in return for singing. Due to the strenuous workload, he falls ill and dies. Enticed by his childhood friend, who flaunts his success, Madesha decides to try his luck in the city. However, in the city, he gets tangled with anti-social elements and ends up in jail. His anxious mother comes to the city in search of him. Jogi is misled and convinced by underworld dons that if he takes up arms, it would be easy for him to find his mother. His mother dies before even seeing her son. Jogi, who does not know this, dances in front of her dead body. When he discovers that he performed the last rites of his mother without realising it, he is completely broken. On the other hand, the underworld men  and who wanted to hack Jogi to death, also drop arms saying, "Jogi took up arms for his mother, for what reason are we fighting?". The movie thus ends with a message of peace and love for all.
