Ronnie Winslow , a cadet at the Royal Naval College, is accused of the theft of a postal order. An internal enquiry which grants him no chance of defence, finds him guilty and his father, Arthur Winslow , is requested to remove his son from the college. Unwilling to accept the verdict, Winslow and his daughter Catherine institute their own enquiries and engage a friend and family solicitor, Desmond Curry  to assist them, including the briefing of the best barrister in England at the time, Sir Robert Morton , should the case come to court. The government is unwilling to allow the case to proceed, but after heated debates in the House of Commons, the government yields, and the case does come to court. Morton is able to discredit much of the supposed evidence and the government finally withdraws the charges against Ronnie. Although the family win the case, each of them has lost something along the way: Dickie Winslow  has been forced to leave Oxford due to the lack of money, Catherine  loses her marriage settlement and subsequently her fianc√©, John Watherstone , and Arthur Winslow loses his health.
