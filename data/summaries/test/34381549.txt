The cartoon starts with Barney driving a motor boat at sea, where he attempts to fish. After dropping the anchor, a sea lion assumes they're playing catch and brings the anchor back. Barney tricks the sea lion into swimming the other way by pretending to throw the anchor in one direction, then throws in another. He goes with it because his foot was tied to the rope, but the sea lion saves him. A fish is stuck in Barney's suit, in which the sea lion, in an attempt to catch the fish with a trident, pokes Barney's backside. The fish gets out of Barney's suit, lands back in the water and the sea lion aides Barney in catching it. After chasing it into a cave, the sea lion unsuccessfully warns Barney of an oncoming shark, and flees. The shark pulls up behind him and bumps Barney's bottom, which Barney thinks is more of the sea lion's goading; he turns around and angers the shark by poking him with the trident. Barney tries evading the shark by pretending to be an underwater king, which fails. Barney tries hiding under a rock, which is soon revealed to be an octopus that swims away in fear, and the shark tries eating Barney. The sea lion tries to stop it, by keeping the jaws open, to which the shark's teeth nibbles Barney in the rear. Barney and the sea lion get back to the boat with the shark in pursuit. The shark uses its fin to saw the boat in half and Barney tries reconnecting it. Using its tail as a propeller, the shark strikes the boat. Just before the shark finally eats Barney, the anchor bangs the shark on the head and Barney and the Sea Lion use the shark to ride back to land.
