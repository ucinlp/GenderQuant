When his travels bring him to Western Japan, Tora-san decides to pay his respects to the late Hyoichiro Suwa, his sister's father-in-law. He gets drunk with the priest at the temple, falling in love with the priest's daughter in the process. When the priest is too hung-over to deliver a eulogy the next morning, Tora-san takes his place, with great success. Tora-san's sister and his brother-in-law's family show up for Hyoichiro Suwa's memorial service, and an argument breaks out over his estate.<ref name  http://www.kinejun.jp/cinema/id/17391 |title2010-01-29|languageKinema Junpo}}<ref name Stuart |last Stuart Galbraith IV|urlTora-san 32: Tora-san Goes Religious  |date2010-01-29|publisher=DVD Talk}}
