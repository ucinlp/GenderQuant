Alex Browning, a senior high school student, boards Volée Airlines Flight 180 with his classmates and teachers for their senior trip from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City to Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Paris. Before the plane takes off, Alex has a premonition that the flight will explode, killing everyone on board. As events from his vision express themselves in reality, he panics and attempts to stop the flight. The resulting commotion leads to the removal of some passengers, including Alex, orphan Clear Rivers, Alex' best friend Tod Waggner, teacher Valerie Lewton, Alex's rival Carter Horton, Carter's girlfriend Terry Chaney and student Billy Hitchcock. After they have been removed from the plane, none of the passengers believe Alex's statement until the airliner explodes in fire. The survivors are devastated and are investigated by two FBI agents who are particularly interested in Alex's vision. After attending a memorial for the Volée Airlines Flight 180 victims, Tod accidentally hangs himself within his clothesline and is deemed a suicide. When Alex and Clear locate his body, mortician William Bludworth tells them that Death is reclaiming the lives of those who escaped its original plan, as is proven when Terry is hit by a speeding bus. While watching a newsfeed detailing Volée Airlines Flight 180's aftermath, Alex concludes that Death is killing the survivors in accordance with the sequence of their intended demises on the plane. Nonetheless, he is too late to save Ms Lewton from a kitchen knife impalement which ultimately causes a house explosion. The remaining survivors  are reunited as Alex explains the situation. Frustrated by Terry's loss and at having no control over his life, Carter attempts suicide by stalling his car on the railroad tracks. Though he changes his mind, Alex rescues him by ripping his seatbelt before the train collides with his car. However, Billy is unexpectedly decapitated by shrapnel from the wreckage. Withdrawing himself from the group, Alex believes that Death skipped Carter and progressed to Billy. Realizing Clear is actually next rather than himself, Alex rushes to her aid and encounters the FBI agents along the way. Meanwhile, Clear is trapped inside her vehicle, surrounded by loose live wires. Alex sacrifices himself on behalf of her safety by grabbing the wires, initiating an explosion which incapacitates him and the screen fades to white. Six months later, Alex, Clear and Carter arrive in Paris and discuss their survival. Fearing that their struggle is unfinished, Alex narrowly avoids a bus. The bus hurls a parking signage towards a neon sign, which descends on Alex. Carter tackles Alex in time and asks him about the next victim, inadvertently standing in the way of the swinging neon sign as the credits roll implying Alex and Clear as the remaining survivors of the Volée Airlines Flight 180.
