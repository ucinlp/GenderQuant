Chester  is desperate for a promotion at work. To impress his boss, he claims to have been a good soccer player in his youth and is badgered into coaching a girls' team called the Ladybugs. The Ladybugs are sponsored by his company and also includes the boss's daughter, Kimberly , as a player. The team makes a dreadful start to the season and the boss is less than impressed. In his personal life, Chester is engaged to Bess , who has a son, Matthew , from a previous marriage. Matthew just happens to be a great soccer player. Chester invites Matthew to watch the Ladybugs practice and to get some tips. Matthew falls for Kimberly the second he sees her and it is partly due to this that Chester persuades him to dress like a girl and play for the team under the name Martha. With only Chester and Matthew knowing the secret of Martha's identity, the team wins the rest of its games to get to the championship game. Kimberly makes friends with Martha, not knowing "she" is in fact Matthew. Just before the championship game, Bess finds out that Matthew has been dressing as a girl to play. She becomes angry with Chester, making him drop Matthew from the team. Kimberly, who has not been playing well, is also dropped on the request of Chester's boss. The Ladybugs go down 3-0 in the first half. At halftime, Matthew reveals to Kimberly and the rest of the team that he is Martha. His honesty fires the team up and with Chester's encouragement, Kimberly scores the winning goal on a penalty kick. As the Ladybugs win the championship, Chester gets his promotion. Bess and Chester get married while Matthew and Kimberly begin dating.
