At a government laboratory, a weaponized version of influenza is accidentally released, immediately wiping out everyone at the laboratory, save for security guard Charles Campion and his family, who flee the base. However, Campion unknowingly spreads the "super flu" to the outside world. One of the first sites of infection is at a gas station in East Texas where Stu Redman  and some friends have gathered. While others take sick, Stu remains mysteriously healthy and is kept in confinement at a CDC facility in order to study a possible cure. This proves futile and the superflu rages unchecked, killing over 99% of the population. After the infection runs its course a small group of immune survivors lies scattered across the country. These include rock star Larry Underwood , who has just had his big break but is now stranded in a dead New York City, Nick Andros  a deaf man in the midwest, Frannie Goldsmith  a teenager in Ogunquit, Maine, Lloyd Henreid  a criminal stuck in a prison cell, and "Trashcan Man"  a mentally ill scavenger. The survivors soon begin having visions, either of Mother Abagail  a kindly old black woman, or of a demonic seeming man named Randall Flagg, . The two sets of visions call their recipients to travel either to Nebraska to meet Mother Abagail, or to Las Vegas to join Randall Flagg. As their journeys begin, Lloyd Henreid is freed from prison by Randall Flagg in exchange for becoming Flagg's second in command. Trashcan Man, who is a pyromaniac, destroys a set of fuel tanks outside of Des Moines, Iowa hoping to find acceptance with Randall Flagg. Larry Underwood escapes New York and meets a mysterious woman Nadine Cross . Despite their mutual attraction, Nadine is unable to consummate a relationship with Larry, because of her visions of Randall Flagg, who commands her to join him as his concubine. Eventually she leaves Larry to travel on her own. Stu escapes from the CDC facility and soon gathers a group around him including retired professor Glen Bateman , Frannie Goldsmith, and Harold Lauder  a hometown acquaintance of Frannie's who also survived the superflu. Harold grows increasingly frustrated at the way that Stu assumes a leadership role and at Stu's growing romance with Frannie, on whom Harold has a crush. Meanwhile, Nick Andros, makes his way across the midwest, eventually joined by Tom Cullen  a gentle mentally challenged man. Eventually, Stu's group reaches Mother Abagail's farm in Hemingford Home, Nebraska. She tells them of a great conflict that will soon be coming and that they must all travel on to Boulder, Colorado. There, the various survivors, including Nick Andros, Tom Cullen, and Larry Underwood, join with others to form a new community based around Mother Abagail's teachings. Meanwhile, Randall Flagg has set up his own society in Las Vegas, dedicated to violence and excess. For a while, everything seems good in Boulder as people settle down to a new life. However, Frannie discovers that she is pregnant with Jess Rider's child , something which causes her anxiety because she is not sure whether her child will be immune to the superflu. Meanwhile, Harold Lauder grows increasingly dissatisfied with his life in Boulder and begins experiencing visions from Randall Flagg. He is soon seduced by Nadine Cross, and decides to follow Flagg's dictates. Mother Abagail, now the spiritual center of the community, becomes convinced that she has fallen into the sin of pride, and leaves town to walk in the wilderness. Harold builds a bomb and hides it inside the building where Boulder's newly formed leadership council is meeting. Nick Andros notices the bomb and attempts to get it away from everyone else, dying in the process. Most survive, to learn that Mother Abagail has returned from exile and lies dying. Before she passes away she tells Stu, Larry, Glen, and fellow council member Ralph Brentner that they must travel to Las Vegas to confront Flagg. With Winter fast approaching the four men set out on their quest. While crossing a washed out road, Stu breaks his leg and stays behind while the others continue. Larry, Glen, and Ralph are soon captured by Flagg's forces and forced to endure a show trial before being executed. As they are being tortured, to the delight of Flagg's acolytes, Trashcan Man arrives, with a nuclear bomb on a cart. As Flagg transforms into a demonic visage, a spectral hand reaches out and detonates the bomb, destroying Las Vegas and apparently killing Flagg. Stu is rescued by Tom Cullen, who takes him to a nearby cabin to heal as winter sets in. Back in Boulder no one is sure what happened to their missing friends, until Tom and Stu show up in the midst of a blinding snow storm. Soon after being reunited with Stu, Frannie gives birth to a healthy baby; a daughter named in honor of Mother Abagail.
