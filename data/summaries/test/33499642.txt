The film opens with a series of scenes in which local millionaire Sidney Lasseter  has arguments with his son Albert , his wife Martha , and his secretary, Kate Faxton . After the argument with Ms. Faxton, Mr. Lasseter meets with Carter, who is there to ask for a donation to the theater; Mr. Lasseter responds with unreasonable demands in exchange for his donation, as well as a few subtley bigoted comments about the fact that Carter is a Jew. Carter, despite his own best interest, calls Mr. Lasseter an anti-Semite and storms out of the office. That night, Mr. Lasseter is surprised in his car by a stranger who had hidden in the back seat; the stranger fatally shoots Mr. Lasseter. The next day, the detective in charge of the case, Lieutenant Tony "Baloney" Rossini ([[Mike Starr , informs Cash that Mr. Lasseter has been murdered, and that there is a long list of suspects, due to Mr. Lasseter's temper and penchant for making enemies. Cash agrees to accompany Tony when they go to meet Albert, Martha, and Kate, who are all beneficiaries of Mr. Lasseter's will, and thus at the top of the suspect list. While interviewing Mrs. Lasseter, Cash explains that his experience in theater has made him an expert on both observation and human psychology, both of which are helpful in police investigation; he demonstrates this by noting that, due to the muscle tone in her legs, the scuff marks on the soles of her shoes, and the lack of calluses on her hands, Mrs. Lasseter is faking the need for a wheelchair. After interviewing all three top suspects, Cash and Tony conclude that they are all lying about something, but cannot conclude which, if any of them, is responsible for Mr. Lasseter's murder. Scenes of the investigation are intercut with scenes from Cash's personal life, as he dates Mimi Barnes  and copes with the fact that his daughter Sophie  is leaving for college. We also learn how Cash and Tony met, when Tony was assigned to investigate the  murder of Cash's wife; Cash and his wife had been accosted by two thieves who shot Cash's wife while trying to steal her necklace; only one of the thieves was caught, although Tony has sworn to one day find the other. A scene in a restaurant, in which Cash mistakes a random man for the other thief, hints that Cash is still haunted by the murder.
