Jon Jon  sees a ripe opportunity for a major party when he snags the job house-sitting for his rich Uncle Charles. The mansion comes with a platinum colored Mercedes-Benz 430 and, although Uncle Charles has told him not to drive the car or have people over, Jon Jon wastes no time in doing both; Jon Jon is not only having an "entertainment party", but he's auditioning his hip-hop band  for a record executive. When Jon Jon finds out his uncle is coming home earlier than announced, he has to race against time to try to put everything back the way he found it.
