Quincy Adams Sawyer is a young attorney who one day meets a girl in the park. He is immediately smitten with her, but is summoned to the village of Mason's Corners by his father's friend Deacon Pettengill to investigate a villain lawyer before he can pursue her. Meanwhile, Mrs. Putnam, an old woman, is being swindled by this villain lawyer, Obadiah Strout. Putnam's daughter Lindy, a natural vamp, attempts to seduce Sawyer. He shows interest, until he finds out who the girl from the parc is: Alice, Pettengill's niece who has become blind since their first meeting. Despite her being visionally impaired, Sawyer falls in love with Alice and they romance each other. Meanwhile, Strout attempts to scare away Sawyer and convinces Abner Stiles, who once committed a murder, that Sawyer is in town to investigate him. Lindy, on the other hand, tries to get rid of Alice and, with the help from Strout, Lindy lures her onto a boat, after which the rope is cut. The little boat is sent adrift and she is off to the water falls. Lindy is initially glad to lose Alice, but soon regrets her decision. She rushes to Quincy and tells him the entire truth. Quincy, fearing Alice's death, runs to the water falls and rescues her from a fatal fall. Overcome by excitement, Alice's vision is restored and she is reunited with Sawyer. Her father is unaware that his daughter has been saved and becomes convinced that Strout has killed her. He grabs a revolver and attempts to shoot Strout, but he appears to have arrived too late. Stiles, who realized he was being lied to, has killed Strout in a rage.{{cite web}}<ref namehttp://www.lonchaney.org/filmography/131.html |title2010-01-15|work=A Lon Chaney website}}
