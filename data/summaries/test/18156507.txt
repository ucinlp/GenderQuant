Sweet and easygoing Eun Ho grew up in a normal middle-class household with a strict and traditional father. Willful plastic surgeon Ki Baek was born into a wealthy family, and has the ego to match his income. Their two worlds collide quite literally when they meet through a paragliding accident. It's a classic case of opposites attract as they fight, falter, and fall in love, but their incompatible families are determined to break them forever.
