Set sometime in the mid to late nineteenth century in New England, the film tells of unscrupulous undertaker Waldo Trumbull , who murders people in their own homes in order to keep himself in business and to have enough money for drink. One night, after the widow of his last victim absconds to Europe without paying his fee, Trumbull and his reluctant assistant Felix Gillie  decide to murder their money-grubbing landlord, Mr. Black , who is said to have bouts of death-like sleep, something that Trumbull and Gillie are unaware of. Black seemingly dies of a heart attack after discovering Gillie , but revives in the funeral parlor's cellar. After a prolonged chase and struggle to keep Black inside a coffin, Trumbull knocks Black out with a mallet to the head and places the supposedly deceased Black in his family crypt, returning home to celebrate his new-found wealth. However, Black awakes again, escapes from the coffin and crypt and returns to the funeral parlour, quoting random lines from Shakespeare's Macbeth . Humorous events follow as Black chases Trumbull and Gillie around the house with an ax before  being shot and  killed by Trumbull after a lengthy monologue. Gillie elopes with Trumbull's neglected wife, and Trumbull is left a depressed heap on the floor. Hinchley , Trumbull's father-in-law, appears and gives Trumbull some "medicine" . The "medicine" works as intended and Trumbull drops dead as Hinchley makes his way back to bed, oblivious to the fact he has just committed murder. At the end of the film, Black exhibits an allergic reaction to Cleopatra the cat, indicating that he is still alive.
