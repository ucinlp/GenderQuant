Cadet Staff Sergeant Jocko DeParis is a senior at the fictional Southern Military College. Using the authority of his own rank, his father's connections with the school, and the college's tradition of allowing upperclassmen to bully new cadets, DeParis effectively does what he pleases. Everyone at the school is either afraid of him or believes he is a normal or even exemplary cadet. One night, he frames George Avery, the son of a staff member, making it appear that he got drunk and fell unconscious on the quadrangle all by himself. Cadet Avery is expelled, and DeParis sees to it that every cadet who took part in the incident lies during the investigation to conceal his own involvement. Two freshmen, along with the roommates of DeParis and the regimental commander, eventually decide to end DeParis' manipulation of them and the school. By the time DeParis is cornered in a restaurant in the nearby town, a great many cadets have banded together against him. The regimental commander orders him to sign a statement confessing to engineering Avery's expulsion and going to great lengths to conceal the truth from investigators. Initially reacting with smug confidence and indignant anger at being accused, DeParis finally folds and signs the statement, asking that he be allowed to leave quietly. The cadets then take him away from the restaurant and start dragging an increasingly frantic DeParis towards a railroad track. Instead of throwing him in front of the approaching train, they put him on board once it stops. As the train begins to move again, DeParis runs to the rearmost car and rails at the watching cadets, shouting furiously, "I'll be back! I'll get you guys! You can't do this to Jocko DeParis!"
