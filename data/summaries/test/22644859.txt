Victoria Lucas  is a single mother with her teenage Emalee  in an apartment. Emalee is not normal, having come to life through test tube fertilization, under the assistance of Dr. Johnson. The doctor has not only made Emalee, but in secret also used the eggs of Victoria to make seven boys. When Emalee is 14 years, her mother takes her on a camping holiday in the Biesbosch. From her 14th birthday, Emalee begins to suffer from nightmares, about seven men that are identical to fertilize her.
