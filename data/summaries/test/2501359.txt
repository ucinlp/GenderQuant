A couple of aliens who come to earth disguised as a Cowboy and Cowgirl and buy a pet shop from its owner in an attempt to try to eat some of earth's children for dinner. The aliens look like normal people aside from the fact that they have a third eye on their foreheads which they cover with their hats. One by one they give some pets to random kids free of charge. The pets at first seem normal, until they change into their alien forms. The kids meet when they return to the pet shop because their pets stop eating and need some type of "vitamins" that the two aliens feed them.
