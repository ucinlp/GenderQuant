In 2010 Los Angeles, three friends are dissatisfied with their lives: Adam Yates  has been dumped by yet another girlfriend, and his geeky nephew Jacob  lives in his basement. Lou Dorchen  is a party guy way past his prime. Nick Webber  has a dead-end job at a dog spa and an unfaithful and controlling wife named Courtney . Lou almost dies from carbon monoxide poisoning in what his friends think is a suicide attempt. Adam and Nick impulsively take him and Jacob to the site of some of their most memorable weekends, the Kodiak Valley Ski Resort, which has fallen on hard times. During a crazy night of drinking in a hot tub, they spill a can of an illegal Russian energy drink called "Chernobly" on the hot tub's controls. The next day, they wake up in 1986. They see each other as their normal age, but in their reflections and to other people, they appear as they did in 1986, except Jacob, who was not yet born. They arrive during "Winterfest '86," the weekend when Poison played to a huge crowd at the then-thriving Kodiak Resort. At first, the guys do not think that they have traveled back in time but are convinced when they find out that Michael Jackson's skin has not become lighter yet. It is a time that was hard on the group. Adam broke up with his first girlfriend, Jennie , and got stabbed in the eye with a fork. Lou was beaten up by Blaine , the ski patrol bully. Nick played a bad show with his band at an open mike contest. The four are at first concerned that if they change even the slightest thing in this time, it could have drastic consequences in the future, so they set out to do exactly what they did 20 years ago. Later, they decide that this may be a chance to change their destinies. When Jacob begins to flicker in and out, he warns the guys that if they continue what they are doing, then he may be wiped out of existence. A mysterious hot tub repairman  informs Jacob that the key to their time travel was the Chernobly, which contains chemicals that are vital to the time travel process. While drunk, Nick calls Courtney  and yells at her. Her dad interrupts the conversation and Adam and Jacob stop Nick from telling him that Courtney is his wife. Jennie dumps Adam before he can dump her, but he ends up sleeping with a music journalist, April . Nick rocks the crowd with his band with performances of "Jessie's Girl" and "Let's Get It Started." Lou is beaten up by Blaine, but finds the courage to punch him back. Lou also seduces Adam's sister, Kelly , and has sex with her, and conceives Jacob, thus solving the identity of Jacob's father. Phil Wedmaier , helping them to get back to the resort, gets his arm cut off by an oncoming bus, much to Lou's delight. The guys are set to go back to 2010, but, just as the hot tub starts to activate, Lou decides to remain in 1986, admitting to Adam that he was trying to kill himself, and that if he goes back it will happen all over again. He says he wants to use his knowledge of future history to make investments, and do right by Kelly and Jacob. Adam says that if Lou is staying, so is he but Lou pushes Adam into the hot tub, just as it blasts the guys back into 2010. Adam, Nick, and Jacob discover that Lou, Kelly, and Jacob are now a happy family enjoying a lavish lifestyle due to Lou taking advantage of his knowledge of the future. Lou has become a successful rock star with his favorite band, "Mötley Lüe" and is the founder of an Internet search engine called "Lougle". Adam discovers that he eventually married April, and Nick is a successful music producer married to a loyal Courtney. She tells him about a wrong number phone call she got when she was 9, that was enough to keep her from trying to cheat on anybody. Adam, Nick, Lou, and Jacob reunite at Lou's mansion with their families, satisfied with their new lives.
