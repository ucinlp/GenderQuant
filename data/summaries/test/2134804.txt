A young adult from New York is on his way to California for a business meeting when he runs into trouble with some local hoodlums in Kingman who shoot at his car and tried to run him off the road. He hooks up with a hitchhiker who is also passing through town, who turns out to be a former rock and roll musician, and the two attempt to set things right in the town, culminating in their entry in an automobile race from Kingman to Oatman and back.
