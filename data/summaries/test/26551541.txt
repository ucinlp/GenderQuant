The boys are on their way home from a masquerade party when they hear noises in a warehouse and decide to investigate. They find the warehouse is being robbed and they are mistakenly captured by the police and sentenced for robbing it. Gabe, as their lawyer, gets them off with just probation but Slip insists that he and Sach accept jail time in order to find out who is behind the series of robberies in the neighborhood. He deduces that the instructions are being sent from inside the prison via a short wave radio. Upon entering the prison they are mistaken for notorious criminals and make fast friends with the masterminds behind the robberies. Whitey, who owns a short wave radio, overhears the plans and informs Louie who runs out into the street and tells the police of the plans that his sweet shop will be robbed next. The cop doesn't believe him, but eventually Louie is able to persuade the warden of the prison when Whitey hears about a jailbreak attempt. The warden sets up a sting operation and catches the gang that was behind the robberies and the boys are exonerated.
