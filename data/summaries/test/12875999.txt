The Hardy family goes to Catalina for a two week vacation, where Judge Hardy tries to catch a swordfish, Marian falls in love with a married lawyer/lifeguard, and Andy goes around with a "sophisticated" girl. They return home to Carvel to find that by having endorsed a note for Frank Redmond, Judge Hardy has lost all their property to Hoyt Wells. Luckily, through an old law that Judge Hardy learned about while fishing with Capt. Swenson, their home is saved and Hoyt Wells is run out of town.
