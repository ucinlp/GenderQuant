Clark and Summer, a young married couple, are on their way to see Summer's parents. Summer is newly-pregnant, and Clark is worried that her father will be critical of him. Their car has a blowout, and as they don't seem to have a spare tire, the shaken couple decides to walk onwards, to see if they can find help. Upon arriving at a small collection of buildings, they realise that the town is abandoned. It isn't long before a drifter in a cowboy hat comes along. Summer is thrilled to see another person, while Clark obviously has some jealousy issues. The stranger introduces himself as Joseph, and immediately overshadows Clark with his personality and style. That evening, around a campfire, the three talk: Summer shows Joseph a photo of her older son, Ben, who is Clark's stepson; Clark accepts several swigs from the bottle of whiskey that Joseph has with him; and Joseph talks about how -- unlike Clark, who is a slave to society -- he, himself, is beholden to no one except himself and God. Summer seems to admire this, while Clark seethes with jealousy. The next morning, Joseph suggests that he and Clark walk the five miles back to the couple's car and siphon off the gas, then continue on to Joseph's truck, and leave the area. Summer wants to accompany them, but Joseph and Clark both say that in her delicate condition, she should remain. Joseph pulls out a revolver and teaches Summer how to use it, touching her in an intimate way. Clark is obviously furious, but he and Joseph still set off together. On the way to the couple's car, Joseph continually mocks Clark for his weaknesses, claiming to know everything about him. Clark is convinced that Joseph is a fanatical, religious hippie. When they arrive at the car, Joseph tells Clark that everything he is about to go through is his own fault, because of his sins. He promptly disappears. Clark opens the trunk of his car to find Ben's rotting body, buzzing with flies. He is horrified, then realises that he has left Summer alone at the abandoned town. Fueled by adrenaline, Clark rushes back to the town. Meanwhile, Summer has found a room in one of the abandoned buildings with photographs on the wall -- some going back a hundred years -- including her photo of Ben, with a cross scratched onto the picture, over his face. She turns to find that Joseph is in the room with her. She attempts to shoot him, but the gun he gave her is unloaded. Joseph subdues her and uses a razor to carve a cross into her forehead, saying that she will have the mark forever, and will remember what happened there. She begs to know why he is doing this, and he claims that it is God's will. At that moment, Clark arrives and attacks Joseph, beating him to the ground. When Joseph regains consciousness, he is tied to a chair. Clark demands to know how they can escape the town, but Joseph won't say. Clark takes a pair of pliers and cuts off one of Joseph's fingers in order to make him talk. Finally Joseph admits that he is an avenging angel, sent to punish the wicked for their sins. He suggests that Clark tell Summer what was in the trunk of their car, but Clark claims it was nothing. Finally, Joseph agrees to help them leave the town, as long as he can first show them something down by the river. Just past the water tower, there is a field strewn with rough, wooden crosses, marking graves. The couple are horrified, and Summer asks if Joseph killed all those people. He claims that he never killed anyone; they all did it to themselves -- but every one of them deserved it. Further into the makeshift graveyard, there are three empty graves. Joseph again exhorts Clark to tell Summer what his sin is. Clark refuses to say. Joseph loads the gun and hands it to Summer, reiterating that she need only cock the gun and squeeze the trigger. After asking repeatedly what Clark's sin is and receiving no response, and assuming it has something to do with Ben, Summer finally shoots Clark. She slumps to the ground and asks what she did to deserve this pain. Joseph tells her that her sin is apathy: she knew something was wrong, but did nothing about it. Joseph raises his hand to the sky and murmurs a prayer, and his finger reappears. His face is no longer wounded and bloody. Leaving Summer at the graveyard with the gun, he walks off. Summer attempts to shoot herself, but the gun is empty; there was only one bullet in the chamber.
