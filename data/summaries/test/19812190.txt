Puru  and Amritha  are a married couple but they behave like lovers. They like each other but quarrel sometimes. She is a spendthrift and he is a miser. She wants a child to build a family, while he wants to build a house. The film follows their trials and tribulations as they navigate the difficult world of marriage in the modern age. The film also has a strong social message and speaks to the emptiness of a large home without a large family inside it. Amitabh Bachchan makes a guest appearance.
