David Niven plays a globe-trotting author and photographer on assignment from LIFE magazine to do a photo story on best-selling author of the title book, "The Lady Says 'No'," Joan Caulfield. Rather than finding a dour spinster, as he expects, she is a young, attractive blonde, who finds her published theories against love and men set on their head. The unbidden thoughts and impulses even invade her subconscious, in a fascinating dream sequence. It is a battle of the sexes, and the Id and Ego, as the two clash. He tries to show her that her book is "all rot"; while she tries to prove her theories that love is just an autonomic function, which isn't really worth it. They find that they all have a lot to learn, and forgive. It looks like sometimes the answer is "no", and sometimes "yes". Mayhem follows, when her errant Uncle returns, and they get pulled into the lives of the colorful local characters. It all ends in a barroom brawl, with the police, army, and General trying to restore order.  The New York Times critic agreed with David Niven's "trenchant observation [in the film], 'This went out with silent pictures!' Yes, indeed."http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9801E4DA1F3BE23BBC4F53DFB7668389649EDE But, it's still fun. Among supporting roles are James Robertson Justice as her errant Irish uncle, Henry Jones as a charming army sergeant, and Lenore Lonergan as his wife, caught up in all the confusion.
