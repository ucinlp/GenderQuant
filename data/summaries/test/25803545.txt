The film is set in present-time United Kingdom in an alternate history. Eight candidates are seen dressing for what appears to be an employment assessment exam. They enter a room and sit down at individual desks. Each desk contains a paper with the word 'candidate' and a number - 1 to 8 - on. The Invigilator, a representative of the company, explains that the exam takes 80 minutes and consists of one question only, and that there are three rules: do not talk to the Invigilator or the armed guard at the door, do not spoil the paper or allow it to be spoilt, and do not leave the room. Not obeying the rules will result in disqualification. He asks them if they have any questions - no-one replies. After the clock starts, it turns out that the question papers are blank. One candidate is immediately removed from the room for spoiling her paper by writing on it. The seven remaining candidates realize they can talk to each other and work together. "White", who is arrogant and rude, suggests nicknames based on physical appearance: Black, White, Brown, Blonde, Brunette, and Dark, refer to their skin and hair colors, and Deaf is for one candidate who does not pay attention to the others. The candidates use the lights, bodily fluids and fire sprinklers to try to reveal a hidden question on the paper, with no luck. White takes control of the group but really works against them, engineering the disqualifications of Brunette and Deaf. White then taunts the others, saying he knows the question but will not tell the rest. It is revealed that the company in question is responsible for a miracle drug which a large part of the population are dependent upon after a viral pandemic. Black subdues White and ties him to a chair, calling him a distraction to the group. White says he is infected with The Virus and needs his medication, but the others do not believe him. Dark suggests White is actually a plant from the company, and demonstrates much knowledge about the internal workings of the company. This leads Brown to accuse her of being a plant, and tortures her into revealing that she works for the company, but is still applying for the job like everyone else. Just then White goes into convulsions, proving he has the disease. Dark asks the unseen invigilator for help and is disqualified. Blonde finds that Brown was hiding the medication White brought for himself. She retrieves it from the vent that "Brown" had thrown it into and gives it to White. The others release White and want to know the question, but he says the only explanation is that there is no question; the company is going to hire the last remaining candidate. White attacks the others and grabs a gun from the guard - he finds it is fingerprint sensitive and manipulates the guard's hand to work it. White forces Brown to leave the room. Blonde is next, but she turns off the voice activated lights, allowing Black to attack White. When the lights are turned on Black is dead from a gunshot, and Blonde, only having partially left the room  is still in the running. The clock then runs to zero. White addresses the Invigilator to say he is best candidate, but is disqualified; it is revealed Deaf had earlier set the countdown forward by a few minutes and the eighty minutes has not completed. With only Blonde left, she remembers that Deaf had been using his glasses and a piece of broken glass with an exam paper earlier, but had been ignored. Taking the abandoned glasses, she finds the words 'Question 1' on the exam paper in invisible writing. Blonde realizes that Question 1 refers to the only question asked of them - the "Any questions?" by the Invigilator before the exam began, and answers "no". The Invigilator and Deaf enter; it is revealed Deaf is actually the CEO of the company and inventor of the cure for The Virus, which can also heal any wound. The bullet that hit Black contained this cure, and he awakens, healed. With the drug about to be released to the public, the company needed to hire someone who was not only able to make tough choices but who is also compassionate, which Blonde had demonstrated throughout the exam. Blonde passes the exam and accepts her new job.
