The film tells the story of German prisoners of war who are mistakenly taken to a Russian transit women's prison, which temporarily contains women before they are sent to the Gulag. The prison's wardens are women, who want to take revenge on the German soldiers who killed their loved ones during the war. As time passes, the female wardens overcome their hatred for the prisoners and begin to treat them as ordinary people, including engaging in intimate relationships with them. A major theme is the Soviet search for SS officers among the German POWs. The film neglects to mention that many SS men had their blood type tattooed on their arms to allow for swift blood transfusions and so SS men were often easy to identify, see the article SS blood group tattoo.
