A pathologist, Dr. Warren Chapin , discovers that the tingling of the spine in states of extreme fear is due to the growth of a creature that every human being seems to have, called a "Tingler"; a parasite which lives by attaching to a human spine. It curls up, feeds and grows stronger when its host is afraid, effectively crushing the person's spine if curled up long enough. The host can weaken the creature and stop its curling by screaming. Movie theatre owner Oliver Higgins , who shows exclusively silent films, is an acquaintance of Dr. Chapin. Higgins's wife Martha , who is deaf and mute, dies of fright after weird, apparently supernatural events have occurred in her room. During her autopsy, Chapin removes the Tingler from her spine. The centipede-like creature eventually breaks free from the container they held it in, and is released into the theater that the deaf mute woman was running before she died. Chapin wishes not to tell anyone, knowing it would start a panic. The Tingler latches onto a woman's leg, and she screams until it releases its grip. Chapin controls the situation by shutting off the lights and telling everyone in the theater to scream. When the Tingler has left the showing room, they resume the movie and go to the projection room where they find the Tingler and capture it. After they have contained the Tingler and have returned to Higgins' house, it is revealed that Higgins is the murderer; he frightened his wife to death knowing that she could not scream because she was mute. Guessing that the only way to neutralize the Tingler is to reinsert it inside Martha's body, Chapin does so. After he leaves, Higgins, who has admitted his guilt to Chapin, is left alone in the room. As if by supernatural forces, the door slams shut and locks itself, and the window closes, echoing what happened just before Martha was frightened to death. The Tingler causes the body of Martha to rise from the bed. Martha "stands up", and stares at her husband. Higgins is so terrified that he is unable to scream. The screen fades out, and there is the sound of someone  falling either in a faint or dead.
