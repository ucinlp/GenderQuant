The film is set in Viennese high society of about 1900. After a masked carnival ball, Gerda Harrandt , wife of the surgeon Carl Ludwig Harrandt ([[Peter Petersen , allows the fashionable artist Ferdinand von Heidenick later better known in the English-speaking cinema as Anton Walbrook to paint a portrait of her wearing only a mask and a muff. This muff however belongs to Anita Keller , in secret the painter's lover but also the fianc√©e of the court orchestra director Paul Harrandt , the brother of Gerda's husband. The picture is published in the newspaper. When Paul sees it and asks von Heidenick some searching questions about the identity of the model, the artist is forced to improvise a story and on the spur of the moment invents a woman called Leopoldine Dur as the alleged model. Leopoldine Dur however turns out to be a real woman , whose acquaintance Heidenick makes shortly afterwards. This makes his lover Anita so jealous that she shoots him. He survives, and Leopoldine nurses him back to health, in the course of which they fall in love. The true identity of the sitter in the portrait remains a mystery, however.
