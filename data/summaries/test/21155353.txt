From one of the upper middle class suburbs of London, the Woman, having just quarrelled with her husband is going to London, shopping. Unhappily she drives to the station. Among the crowd as she boards the train is the Boy. He is 22 today. He is bored. He is determined to make the day a different one. The Boy moves up and down the crowded corridors. The Woman in her non-smoking compartment badly wants a cigarette and starts to scrape away a ' No Smoking' sign. The Boy is attracted by this middle class rebellion, pulls the sign off and presents it to her says ' Hello' and tries to engage her in conversation. Later, battling her way into a department store she finds he has followed her. Leaving the store, she thinks she has lost him. But he catches up with her on a crowded pavement. She tries to throw him off, he finds her again. She flees to her mother's apartment - followed by the Boy. The Woman is desperately embarrassed and tries to explain, but her mother treats the whole thing lightly and the Woman learns with surprise that her mother had a past. Mother says ' He's good for you. If you have an affair with him you'll regret it. On the other hand if you don't have an affair with him you'll also regret it...' Inevitably, they do have an affair. According to the director Alvin Rakoff, Say Hello to Yesterday was 'a 1970 Brief Encounter, a picture designed purely for entertainment, with no morals or messages unless the public like to find them.'Press release from Cinerama Releasing ,LTD.
