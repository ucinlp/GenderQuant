James Murphey is a rugged cryptozoologist, who thirty years earlier, during a trip to Loch Ness, Scotland, had a fatal encounter with the fabled "Nessie" creature that killed his father, and left James with deep facial scar. Twenty years later, James is hunting for Nessie, when his search leads him to the sleepy town of Pike Island, Ashburn, on Lake Superior. Hiring Josh Riley as his guide, James and Josh bond over their mutual scientific interests and deceased fathers, while James tries to convince Josh's mother, Sheriff Karen Riley, that a 60-foot Plesiosaurus is killing and breeding. Meanwhile, Josh leaves to find his girlfriend, Zoe, who along with three others is camping on a small deserted island on the lake. When one of them disappears , the others attempt to escape and one is killed and another is injured. The film climaxes when Sheriff Riley, Murphy and Deputy Neil Chapman spot Josh's flare, and track the creature and her offspring to a magnetite mine on the island. Sheriff Riley and Josh manage to kill some of the offspring, while her partner, Neil, dies after running out of ammunition and being attacked by others. Josh lures Nessie away from Zoe and traps her in a container filled with magnetite. Murphy stabs the creature with a cyanide-filled syringe, then helps Josh by getting him out of harm's way and throws his cigar lighter into the container, igniting the explosive magnetite and destroying the creature. Sheriff Riley asks if James will now start "chasing Sasquatch", to which he replies that he will probably find a nice small town to call home. Josh asks if he means Ashburn, to which he laughingly replies "yeah."
