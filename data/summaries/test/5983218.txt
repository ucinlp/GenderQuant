The Stooges are working as singing waiters at a restaurant and meet two doctors (Vernon Dent, [[John Tyrrell  who ask them to cheer up Betty Williams, a little girl who is sick from grief because her father , a bank cashier, has been kidnapped while delivering bonds. After the Stooges, as little girls with blonde sausage curls, fail to cheer her up, they volunteer to find the girl's father. The doctors give them a brief description of the father . He and Betty like to yodel to each other, something Curly seems rather adept at. The Stooges waste no time in stopping every suspect in sight and giving them the Stooge third degree. Frustrated, Curly starts yodeling, and after a few maladies that befall him , the boys hear a response...from a radio that one of the kidnappers, Butch , has on. Butch is guarding Betty's father who is gagged and tied to a bed. Mistaking the yodeling cowboy on the radio for the cashier, the Stooges follow the sounds and intercede, knock out Butch, and free Betty's father. Just then, three other members of the gang return. The Stooges and the father barricade the room door and use the dumbwaiter to escape to the basement. The four men follow them downstairs where a fight ensues, plunging everything into darkness, leaving only Curly fully conscious afterward to light a candle. The cashier is reunited with Betty, who recovers from her lethargy, and the pair, along with the two doctors, are serenaded at the restaurant by the Stooges.
