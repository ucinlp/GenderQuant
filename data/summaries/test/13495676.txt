The pair escape the car and find another couple, Harriet and Ward, slautghtered in the car next to theirs. Soon after, psychiatrist Jack Grefe ([[Richard Sanders  arrives, along with Sheriff Tom Anderson , who is distraught to find his wife, Harriet, is one of the lovers who has been murdered. The killer, Ray Hennessey  is caught, and revealed to be one of Jack's patients who had an obsession with Harriet. Ray is incarcerated in a nearby state institution for the criminally insane. Present day, Jack has devoted the last thirteen years of his life keeping Ray, who has gained the nickname "The Hook", behind bars. Meanwhile, Tom's outcast daughter, Mandy Anderson  attends high school with Michael Lamson , his girlfriend Chloe Grefe , Bradley , Janelle Bay , Doug  and couple Cathy  and Tim . After Chloe hears Michael is planning to break up with her, she attempts to drown him in the swimming-pool. Jack is called down to the school about his daughters actions, where he meets with Principal Penny Lamson  and Tom. Chloe is suspended and Penny grounds her son, Michael. Soon after, Ray retrieves his hook and escapes the mental institution. Tom goes to the school to warn Penny of the hooks escape, as it was her husband who had been cheating with Harriet and murdered years before. At night, Michael sneaks out of his house. While the group hang out at the bowling alley, Chloe makes out with Bradley. Also there is Tom, who tells Deputy David Schwick  to look out for Chloe because of the hooks escape. Chloe tells Doug that her and Bradley are going to lovers lane, and to make sure that Michael finds them there. Doug then asks Mandy out, as he does not have a date. While traveling, Chloe and Bradley stop at a shop, where Chloe does not realise a worker has been murdered. Deputy David enters the shop, only to be stabbed to death. Penny finds Michael is missing and alerts Tom. Mandy, Michael, Janelle, Doug, Cathy and Tim arrive at lovers lane. Doug, Tim and Cathy see Bradley's car, and so walk over to it, only to find Chloe and Bradley murdered, before Tim is stabbed to death by the hook. Doug and Cathy run back to the car, and the rest escape. However, Doug soon crashes the car. Meanwhile, Tom and Penny find the group have gone to lovers lane. As the group regain consciousness they are split up. Mandy and Michael reach a farmhouse where they arm themselves with a gun and find Janelle and Doug, who has broke his leg. While Janelle tends to an unconscious Doug, Mandy and Michael go to the barn to retrieve the missing owners car. Back in the house, Janelle begins to hear noises before the hook smashes through a window. Janelle runs upstairs and barricades herself in a room, but the hook gets in and stabs her to death. As Doug wakes up, the hook kills him. As Michael drives the car out of the barn, he accidentally runs over Cathy, killing her. The pair re-enter the house and find Doug and Janelle dead before the hook attacks them. They lock themselves in the kitchen, and turn the gas on, before escaping out a window. As the hook opens the door, a match is sparked and the house blows up. Meanwhile, Tom and Penny go to Jack's house where they find a shrine to Mandy. As Mandy and Michael drive back to town, they find Chloe still alive, who swears Bradley is still alive at lovers lane. Arriving at lovers lane, Mandy gets out the car and finds Tim's phone and manages to speak to Tom, before the hook grabs her through the bushes. In the car, Chloe attacks Michael with a hook, revealing herself to be a killer, but he escapes. As Chloe exits the car she runs into Ray, who slaughters her with a hook. Mandy is forced into a car by her attacker, revealed to be Jack who survived the explosion and was the one that killed Harriet and Ward years previously. Michael saves Mandy, and as a fight breaks out, Tom and Penny arrive and shoot Jack before Mandy eventually kills him with a hook. The next day at lovers lane, Mandy and Michael are medically checked, before they leave Tom and Penny and enter a police car, that is revealed to be driven by Ray.
