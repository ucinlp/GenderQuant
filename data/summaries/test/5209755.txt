Sivakasi alias Muthappa  is a do-gooder in Chennai who works as a welder there. He enjoys life with his friends and forgets the past he left behind. He falls in love with a rich girl Hema  and her family accepts him as an honest and good man at heart. One day, he lashes out at his lover's brothers and Hema yells at him. Sivakasi gives her one slap and tells her that he was not the way he currently is. He tells her about his past. Muthappa was a good boy who lived in a village named Nattarasan Kottai and who followed his parents orders. His elder brother Udayappa  who was a crook even as a child, tells him to get some fireworks for the village Deepavali festival. Muthappa obeys and Udayappa lights the firework. A woman stands on top of the bursting firecracker and begins to burn. She begs for life because of the pain she feels. His father  interrogates his two sons. Udayappa tells Muthappa to not tell that it was him. Muthappa is left in awkward silence. Udayappa screams to the village that it was Muthappa. Their father thrashes Muthappa and disowns him. Muthappa is thrown out of the village and leaves for Chennai. Ashamed and no longer knowing who he is, Muthappa decides to make friends with locals in Chennai and gains their respect. After hearing all this, Hema is shocked as she never knew Muthappa's horrific past. She tells him to go back home and then only she will marry him. Sivakasi leaves for his village and realizes how much has changed over the years. His father is now dead. His brother, now a MLA, has gained notoriety, and treats his mother  and younger sister  very badly. After finding out the pitiable condition of his mother and sister, he decides to teach a lesson to Udayappa. He does not reveal his true identity to them. Udayappa also does not know that Sivakasi is his brother. With the support of Sivakasi and his mother, his sister decides to contest against Udayappa. After several humiliations to Udayappa, the latter fights Sivakasi and throws him out of the village. Sivakasi returns to the village the next day and continues to support his sister in the election by exposing the misdeeds of Udayappa. In the election, his sister wins by a huge margin, Udayappa losing his deposit. His mother-in-law, who was his mentor, takes away his wife  in rage for losing the election and Udayappa is ruthlessly beaten up by her goons. Udayappa, having terrorised the village people for so long, now begs for someone to help him. Sivakasi goes to his rescue and kills all the goons except for the mother-in-law. He reveals who he is to the whole village. Udayappa begs for Sivakasi's forgiveness and they both embrace and reconcile. Hema comes and informs everybody that she and Sivakasi will marry. Udayappa and the rest of the village humorously beat Sivakasi and the marriage between Sivakasi and Hema takes place. Everyone is proud of Sivakasi and the village embrace him as their hero.
