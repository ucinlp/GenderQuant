The people of the town of Hamelin are celebrating the high rat population being driven from the town. The cats hearing the news, do not bode well for them as it means their main food source is gone. In panic, they decide to go to the Supreem Cat for a solution to the problem. Supreem tells to the crowd of cats that his plan is to get the rats back by sabotaging the Piper's reward collecting with a full-body rat suit. While wearing the rat disguise, Supreem sneaks into the town hall. Supreem arrives at the town hall just at the time that Porky is going to get his reward money from the mayor. Supreem walks straight into the mayor's office and does a Last of the Mohicans impression and the mayor tells Porky he won't be getting the money until that rat is gone. Around the town, Supreem bothers Porky by running around in the rat costume and momentarily removes it to trip and insult Porky in various ways. Porky eventually grabs the "rat" by its rubber tail and Supreem deliberately doffs it. Porky takes the empty costume back to the town hall to get the reward money. Just when the mayor gets the reward money from the vault, Supreem pops out and steals it. Porky chases after him to get it back, which he does by tricking the cat to come out of hiding by pretending to bring the rats back  Finally Porky gets the reward money and insults the cat back before he leaves playing his clarinet and walks into the distance.
