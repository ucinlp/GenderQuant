One of a pair of giant bioengineered pythons with acidic venom and armor-like skin, created by a Russian and American joint military operation led by U.S. Army Colonel Robin Evans Jefferson, Jr. , escapes into Russia's Ural Mountains. Jefferson and his team go to retrieve it, and find disaster in a clandestine Russian military base where the creature slaughters soldiers and scientists alike. American Dwight Stoddard  and his Russian wife Nadia  hires them to move some mysterious container, and they reach the isolated and deserted Russian military base. Larson's primary concern is retrieving the snakes' DNA, and he begins to kill his own men in the attempt before being eaten himself by one snake. Nadia leads one snake through a land mine field while the other one is blown up by an explosive hurled into the snake's mouth by Dwight. Only Dwight and Nadia survive, and are rescued by Russian soldiers.
