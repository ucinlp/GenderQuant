Express Engineering Corp is building a highway in the forest near Mt. Fuji. Challenged by local villagers, foreman Shiro Tsutsumi and his crew are plagued with protests and sabotage. Nearby, a survey team from the UN is killed when their helicopter is destroyed by a sonic beam emitted from a cave in the mountains. A small boy, Eiichi Kanamura, grandson of the village elder Tatsuemon Kanamura, finds reporter Okabe snooping around. Okabe and Eiichi check out a strange light which leads them to the cave where Gyaos, a giant flying monster, is currently residing. Running for his life, Okabe ditches Eiichi at the cave, but runs into Gyaos who devours him. Shiro and his crew arrive just in time to see a battle between Gamera and Gyaos . During the battle, it is realised that Gyaos can't withstand fire. Realising this, Gamera grabs the young boy and gets him to safety. After alerting the public about Gyaos and his abilities, zoologist Dr. Aoki investigates Gyaos' prehistoric origins. The public is put on alert. But after another battle with Gamera, Gyaos seems to be the victor . Even after using light flares to annoy Gyaos, he still annihilates the Japanese Self-Defense Force and heads for Nagoya. Gyaos wreaks havoc in the city until Gamera shows up, fighting the flying beast. After another battle, Gamera holds Gyaos in the water while the sun rises. But Gyaos, sensing his mortal danger, chooses to sever his own foot in lieu of death and flies off. A plan is put into effect that would draw Gyaos into the sunlight after experiments reveal that the sun causes the severed foot to shrink. The Defense Force constructs a rotating platform with a giant bowl of artificial blood on it. Gyaos, landing on the platform and drinking the artificial blood, will be held in place by the centrifugal force and not be able to get off before the sun rises. The plan ultimately fails. It all comes down to a final showdown between Gamera and Gyaos which ends when the sun rises, and the weakened Gyaos is killed when Gamera drags his archenemy into the crater of Mt. Fuji. Afterwards, Gamera is then seen flying off of Mt. Fuji and heads home.
