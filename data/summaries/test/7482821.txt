Bravo, My Life! opens in October '79 with the news of President Park's assassination. But for 14-year-old Gwang-ho, it more importantly is his first day at junior high, where the kids are interested in football and brawling. Gwang-ho's mom, Mal-sun, whose husband is working in Saudi Arabia, devotes everything to her children, despite a nagging illness; Gwang-ho, meanwhile, has his first stirrings for a pretty neighbor, nurse Eun-suk.
