Heinrich Schmidt  an engineer badly contaminated in the accident, knows that the leak will poison the groundwater for hundreds of miles around and wants to warn the public. His boss, however, is only interested in protecting himself and believes that the accident should be covered up, when in fact the contamination risks thousand of lives. Heinrich escapes from the facility but is badly injured. Lost in the woods and suffering from amnesia, he is rescued by Larry Stilson , a car mechanic on vacation, and his wife Carmel . As Heinrich tries to piece together his memories of what happened, his boss' thugs are quickly closing in on the trio.
