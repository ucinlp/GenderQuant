Slug McSlug, a notorious criminal , is chased by police after successfully robbing the Last National Bank. He reaches his country hideout, where he is promptly visited by an uninvited Daffy Duck, who is a door-to-door salesman of a variety of items. McSlug slams the door in Daffy's face, but Daffy doggedly persists in his efforts to sell something to McSlug, raising the ire of the wanted criminal. McSlug hammers a fake foot by Daffy, who zaps McSlug with a joy buzzer. McSlug threatens to shoot Daffy but Daffy uses a tonic that makes the gun limp. Daffy is evicted, but brings McSlug more confusion when he gets back inside via helicopter . Daffy saws a hole and uses an elevator to gain entry and tells McSlug that he's not leaving until he sells something. McSlug asks for brass knuckles and when he gets them, the bank robber prepares to punch Daffy, only to shatter them and hit his fist on an iron. McSlug opens fire on Daffy with a machine gun, who conveniently is wearing a sample of his company's bullet-proof vests. "Guaranteed to get your money back if it fails to work!" says Daffy. When Daffy turns on the gas of McSlug's stove to demonstrate the igniting power of his sample lighter, McSlug literally throws Daffy out and tries the lighter himself, which blows the hideout and McSlug sky-high. The victorious Daffy yells toward the sky: "Hey, bub! You need a house to go with this doorknob!"
