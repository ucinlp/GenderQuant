Munna , Babu Kalyanam aka Bob Galy ([[Bharath , Juju ([[Nakul , Krishna  and Kumar  are five friends. They come from different backgrounds- Munna from a middle-class family, Bob Galy from a Telugu-speaking family, Juju from an academic-achieving family, Krishna from a rich family and Kumar from a poor family. But all of them have common interests- spending their time downing alcohol, ogling at girls, watching porn and complaining about their parents. Much to the chagrin of their parents, they have no interest in studies. They even go as far as hiring a prostitute  but all of them back down at the last moment. They meet a depressed middle-aged man, Mangalam ([[Vivek  in a bar one day and help him home after he passes out. Although they first use him as a source to get alcohol, Mangalam enjoys their company and becomes a mentor of sorts for the boys. One day, the boys see a teenage girl, Harini  and all of them decide to ask her out. Everyone’s try ends in disaster, but they all become friends. However, Munna is still in love with Harini and cannot forget her. He conveys his feelings to her while on a day-out in a resort, but she rejects him. Later, Harini's friend tells Munna that Harini would accept him only if he streaks on Mount Road, which was not true. But Munna believes her, does it and gets arrested. When Harini finds out what Munna had done, she gets him out on bail and accepts Munna's love. Eventually, both Munna's and Harini's parents find out about their relationship and are furious, as they want them to focus on their studies first. At a meeting at Harini's house, her parents decide that both Munna and Harini will not contact each other till their studies are over and after that, if they are still in love, the parents would not stand in their way. Although the kids agree to this, they continue to long for each other. Meanwhile, Harini's mother, determined to end her daughter's relationship with Munna, arranges a wedding alliance between Harini and her younger brother, who lives in the USA, despite Harini's protests. Harini and Munna run away from their homes and go to Tirupati, where they get married. On hearing this news, both Munna's and Harini's parents disown them. To show solidarity to Munna, his friends walk out of their homes too. Mangalam helps them find a modest residence and the teenagers take up part-time jobs to support themselves. This does not prove successful however, so Mangalam encourages them to explore their natural musical talents. The teenagers form a band named "Boys", making modern versions of popular Tamil devotional songs, and eventually gain recognition. Soon, they are approached by a Naxalite group to make songs against the government. They do it for the money however, and soon get arrested under POTA. After they are released from prison, the teenagers show more resolve to succeed. After a few unsuccessful attempts, they are finally signed by Sony Music and record their first album. While celebrating their success, Krishna, in a drunken state, accidentally tells Harini about their earlier encounter with a prostitute. A deeply-hurt Harini leaves Munna and returns to her parents, despite his protests that they did not meet before the encounter and that he did not have sex with the prostitute. As the prostitute is the only one who could prove that Munna did not have sex with her, the friends begin searching for her. Kumar spots the prostitute travelling in a bus and tries to get into the running bus, but in the process he falls under the wheels of the bus and dies. Munna decides that his words were more than enough proof for Harini and accepts Harini’s decision. Meanwhile, Harini agrees to marry her maternal uncle. Their album releases and becomes a huge hit. But without Harini, the lead female vocal for the group, the record labels are unwilling to sign the group. When the boys request Harini’s presence for a live show on MTV, her parents accept, but on the condition that Munna sign the divorce papers. Munna agrees, realising that their career is more important than their love. The group has a very successful live debut. They dedicate their first live success in memory of Kumar. On the day of the divorce hearings, Mangalam, now the pop group’s manager, fields many calls to replace Harini with another girl. When she looks at the pictures of all the pretty girls vying to be the group’s new lead female vocal, a bout of jealousy strikes her. She gets angry and starts hitting Munna. As they fight, they finally share a kiss. The judge  sees this as a sign that she still cares for him and does not agree to the divorce. It is implied that Munna and Harini get back together.
