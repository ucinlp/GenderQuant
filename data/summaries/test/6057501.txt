A fashion photographer, Ben Morris, goes to a remote South America location to take pictures of model Alison Duquesne for a lipstick ad. An adventurer they encounter, Sammy Ryderbelt, steals their helicopter and leaves them stranded in the jungle. When the three are reunited, they discover a treasure map on the corpse of the late Captain Stopes and the three team up to find it. They are joined by Crowley, a clever Australian who claims to be Stopes' former partner. Crowley steals everyone's supplies and mules and takes off, but he is hunted down by Ryderbelt and killed. The remaining three make it to the diamond mine, only to find that a South American bandit leader, Raul Ortega, has beaten them to it. A battle leads to Ortega being seized and his men killed. Ryderbelt makes off with the helicopter and diamonds before anyone can stop him. Local law officials are satisfied to have the long-wanted Ortega in custody at last. In an unexpected twist, Ben reveals he is not just a photographer but a U.S. government agent. He sets out after Ryderbelt and the loot.
