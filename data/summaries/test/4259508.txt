Set against the backdrop of rural Bengal during feudal times, Devdas is the story of a doomed love affair between Devdas , son of the local zamindar , a high-caste Brahmin, and Parvati , the daughter of their neighbour, also a Brahmin, but belonging to a slightly lower status in terms of caste, affluence and status. They grow up as childhood sweethearts. When they decide to marry, Devdas' father puts his foot down, packing his younger son off to Calcutta for higher studies. Parvati's marriage is finalized with a wealthy zamindar, a widower with children older than his young second wife. Learning about Parvati's marriage, Devdas rushes back to his village and tries to stop it, in vain. Parvati is prepared to elope with him: Devdas refuses and Parvati leaves his room in the middle of the night, castigating him for his cowardice.  In Calcutta, Chunilal  introduces him to an attractive and strong-willed courtesan, Chandramukhi , and initiates Devdas into the darker corridors of the city. Devdas finds an easy escape in drink and though he insists that he hates Chandramukhi, he keeps coming back to her for moral support. Chandramukhi falls in love with him. He meets Parvati once more, when he returns to the village to perform the last rites of his father. He bequeaths his share of the family wealth to his older brother, ear-marking a part of it for his mother during her lifetime. Parvati pleads with him to give up drinking. He evades a direct reply and instead promises to see her at least one last time before he dies. Back to the city, he drowns himself in drink. Chandramukhi gives up the life of a professional courtesan and concentrates on nursing Devdas back to health. He gives up drinking for some time and is advised to go on a holiday. He embarks on a train journey across the country, destination unknown. He stealthily runs away one night, leaving his faithful family retinue Dharamdas in the train when he chances upon a junction station that will take him to Manikpur where Parvati lives. He treks along in a bullock cart to see Parvati one last time. He dies a tragic and painful death under a tree outside her house before Parvati can see him.
