An enormous and angry 35-foot Great White Shark begins attacking humans when they build a beach just for swimmers by Port Harbor, a coastal town. Despite repeated attacks, the mayor does nothing to stop it as he doesn't want tourists to hear about it and stop coming. Enter the heroes: Peter Benton , a novelist who wrote a book about sharks, and Ron Hamer , an old seadog who has a personal grudge against this shark and wants it dead. They sail into the middle of the ocean to save stranded people and stop the monster. Eventually, Ron drowns, but Peter, remembering the explosives inside his wetsuit, feeds Ron's corpse to the shark and ignites it, blowing the shark to pieces. Peter swims to Port Harbor and returns home.
