However, when he gets there, Coolidge is no longer the fun loving school of his dad's time, but a military-based institution run by Dean Reardon . Reardon, a military man who hates the senior Wilder, wants to make the younger Wilder's life miserable. He can not force him out because his dad is rich and has ties to the school, so he tries to make Van's life a living hell. Van turns a one bedroom dorm into a two bedroom . His roommate is Farley , a pothead from Jamaica. The boys decide to throw a party on campus, which is not allowed, along with kissing, drugs, alcohol, sex, or anything else that is 'fun'. The only person to show up to the party is Yu Dum Fok . The boys try to find the girls, but they just find some religious, prudish girls led by Eve . After she throws sacramental wine on them, Van pulls a prank on them during church. Reardon knows Van is behind the prank, so he commands his ROTC students, Dirk  and his closeted sidekick Corporal Benedict , on Van, trying to make him crack. Van falls for Dirk's girlfriend, Kaitlin , causing Dirk to get even more upset. Kaitlin thinks, lives, and breathes the military, and believes in chastity before marriage. Of course, Van has to shake things up. After playing a military game with Reardon that results in him stepping down as dean and being tasered, Van and Kaitlin end up together and Van decides to finish college. The film ends as Van leaves Dirk and Benedict tied to each other in their underwear.
