The film centres around a barn that is used by a group of children as a meeting place for singing practice. When the owner of the property comes into financial difficulty and considers selling the barn, one of the children comes up with an idea to raise money. The children dye sheep on his property and market the coloured wool as a naturally occurring phenomenon. The coloured wool soon becomes sought by buyers all over the world. However, when the coloured wool runs thin, the owner is still in danger of losing his barn. Two station hands sympathetic to the plight of the children decide to help by winning the remaining money in a sheep shearing contest.
