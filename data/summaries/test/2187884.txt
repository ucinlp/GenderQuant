Maindrian Pace  is an intelligent, respectable insurance investigator who runs a quality auto chop shop in Long Beach, California. What very few know is that he is the leader of a group of professional car thieves which steal cars around the town and sell it remodeled for a good price. One day, a South American drug lord arrives at Pace's office and offers him $400,000 to steal 48 specific cars to be delivered to his place within five days. The cars are all very high-end, ranging from Mustangs and Cadillacs to limousines and race vehicles, making the order quite difficult to fill it under the time limit, but Pace still wants to get the money. Mapping out a basic strategy, the gang begins to scout out their targets which have all been given female names. One example is a yellow 1973 Ford Mustang Mach 1, receiving the code name"Eleanor". Being part of the insurance industry, Pace does have one small idiosyncrasy when it comes to stealing: All of the cars stolen by the gang must be insured, because Pace wants to make sure the owners get the insurance for the cars. The thieves carry out their plan easily at first but run into a couple of obstacles. First, a white Cadillac that the gang steals is revealed to have several kilos of heroin stashed in the trunk. Against his brother-in-law Eugene's suggestion to sell the heroin on the side, Pace has the Cadillac and its contents burned at a remote location. Then they discover that the "Eleanor" they stole is not insured after its owner posts a notice on the local newspaper. After pleas from his fianc√©e Pumpkin Chace he decides, much to the chagrin of his buddies, to return it. After that, they manage to get 47 cars stolen and delivered. On the day before the deadline, a disguised Pace spots another "Eleanor" at a radio station in Long Beach and prepares to steal it, but is unaware the police have been alerted after his brother-in-law sells him out anonymously following a fight over the stolen Cadillac. As a result of the tip-off, two detectives  confront a disguised Pace as he is about to drive out of the carpark. This results in a lengthy 34-minute car chase  that spans from Long Beach to Carson. During the chase, Pace drives a battered "Eleanor", which belongs to the radio DJ of Constant Country K-Fox who is giving updates on the chase but doesn't know it's his car, into a 30-foot jump over a prior car crash, losing the police in the process. Pace is now desperate because the car is almost destroyed. Minutes later, Pace spots another yellow "Eleanor" Mustang pulling into a car wash. He asks for his car to be washed and then dupes the owner of the other Mustang into reporting to the manager's office. He subsequently leaves the car wash with the other Mustang, switching the license plates and removing his disguise. The Mustang owner faints at the sight of the wrecked "Eleanor" exiting the car wash machine while the manager is arrested by the police, who mistake him for Pace.
