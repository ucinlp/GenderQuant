Sathyanathan, Punyakodi and their partners are an atrocious lot. They keep suppressing the villagers and do not even allow them to get proper education due to fear of losing control over the village. On the other hand Ranga  and Tyagu  are honest factory workers who lead the fight against the Factory owner for the laborers rights. The clash between the two sections of society reaches a level where Sathyanathan and gang plot to eliminate Ranga and Tyagu. They manage to do away with Tyagu; however Ranga is too smart for them. How Ranga manages to punish the wrong doers is what the second half of the film is all about.
