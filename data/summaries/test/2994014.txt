The Mountain of Destiny looms before us as we overhear the Old Man of Wandering Mountain  reading from a large book. Using a writing stylus he begins to record a prophecy of a day when 'The Nasty' will arrive in Fantasia. He goes on to describe the savior of "Extraordinary Courage". Bastian Balthazar Bux  has begun a new chapter in his life. His father Barney ([[Kevin McNulty  has re-married, and now Bastian has a new step mother named Jane  whose daughter Nicole  is displeased at having a new family. Bastian has also started high school, where he has become victim to the Nasties, a quintet of bullies led by Slip . He manages to get them expelled by the janitor  after they trap him in the boiler room. He flees to the library where he is surprised to find Mr. Koreander  and The Neverending Story. The Nasties locate him, but he uses the book to escape to Fantasia. Bastian arrives in Fantasia, where he is reunited with old friends Falkor  and the gnomes Engywook and Urgl . However, the Nasties find the Neverending Story and use their cruelty to bombard the land with fireballs and a storm. Meeting a walking tree troll named Bark Troll , Bastian and the group of his friends head for the Wandering Mountains to speak with the Childlike Empress . She asks Bastian to find the Neverending Story with AURYN. Falkor, Barky, the gnomes and the Rock Biter's son, Junior, help him; a "wish overload" causes the group to scatter across Earth. Barky ends up in a conifer forest somewhere; Falkor saves Junior from falling to his death near Mount Rushmore; and the gnomes end up in Nome, Alaska. Bastian locates Falkor and Junior. Falkor flies off to find the others while Junior stays at Bastian's house. Rock Biter sadly informs his wife that Junior is gone and the effects of the Nasties cause them to fall out. Nicole takes AURYN from Bastian's room, discovers its wishing abilities, and takes it for a shopping trip to the local mall. Bark Troll arrives at Bastian's house disguised as a garden plant, while the Gnomes are mailed in a box. The reunited group go to the mall to find Nicole so they can get AURYN back. The Nasties find it first, whereupon giant crustacean creatures appear in Fantasia to kill the Empress and her advisors. Everyone in the mall begins to turn to evil, including Mr. Koreander and Bastian's parents. Nicole runs away and reveals to Bastian outside that her father was abusive and eventually divorced Jane. Bastian is struck by lightning, and begins to succumb to the cruel effects of the Nasties, but Nicole saves him. The two rush back to the mall where all the Fantasians are being held captive by the Nasties. Bastian manages to retrieve both AURYN and the book and defeats the Nasties with a range of fighting moves he wished for. The Fantasians are sent back to Fantasia, which is restored to its former magnificence. Bastian and Nicole manage to keep their parents from divorcing, while Junior is reunited with his parents. Nicole and Bastian return to school the next day and find that Bastian turned Slip and the Nasties into friendly school students. Bastian returns the Neverending Story to Mr. Koreander, who tells him that the story is not over yet.
