Clay Easton  is a college freshman who returns home to Los Angeles, California, for Christmas to find things very different from the way he left them. His high school girlfriend, Blair , has become addicted to drugs and has been having sex with his high school best friend, Julian Wells . Julian has become a drug addict and has been cut off by his family for stealing to support his habit. Julian is also being hassled by his dealer, Rip , for a debt of $50,000 that he owes to him. Clay's relationship with Blair rekindles and Julian's behaviour becomes more volatile. His addiction is worsening and since he does not have the money to pay off his debt, Rip forces him to become a prostitute to work off the debt. After suffering through a night of being sick from not being able to score drugs and hiding from Rip, Julian decides to quit and begs his father  to help him. He then tells Rip the next day his plans for sobriety, which Rip does not believe and lures Julian back into doing drugs and hooking. Clay finds Julian and rescues him and after a violent confrontation with Rip and his henchman. They escape and begin the long drive back home. The next morning, Julian dies in the car. After Julian's funeral, Clay and Blair are sitting on a cemetery bench reminiscing about him. Clay then tells Blair he is going back east and wants her to go with him, to which she agrees.
