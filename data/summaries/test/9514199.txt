Many years ago, a small, isolated tribe were cursed by spirits for their sins. One of the tribesmen crafts a pi単ata, to which the tribe put their evil into and set afloat in the ocean. The curse was lifted from the tribe, however if the pi単ata was to be disturbed, an evil would be unleashed. Present day, a group of sorority girls and fraternity boys, consisting of Kyle , Tina , Doug , Jake , Lisa , Carmen , Larry , Julie , Bob  and Connie , sail to a remote island for an annual Cinco de Mayo treasure hunt. There, every fraternity boy is handcuffed to a random sorority girl. Each couple is instructed to collect as many pairs of strewn underwear on the island as possible. The couple that collects the most underwear and presents them to Monica  and Paul , the judges, will receive $20,000. The groups consist of Jake and Julie, Doug and Carmen, Bob and Lisa, Larry and Connie, and Kyle and Tina. As the hunt starts, the pairs eagerly retrieve underwear, apart from Kyle and Tina who have just broken up with each other. Bob and Lisa find a clay pi単ata, which they think has tequila or wine, but instead it was made by a tribe and they accidentally bring it to life, where it proceeds to beat Bob to death with a branch, while Lisa runs away.  Kyle and Tina decide to forget about the break up and join in the game. Meanwhile, Lisa attempts to warn Larry and Connie of the pi単ata, but nethier of them believe her and continue on their search. As they do so, they pick up a shovel, and get a bunch of underwear from a secret stash.The pinata picks up the shovel, and crushes Connie's head before turning on Larry. Lisa goes to the camp, and tells Paul and Monica about what she saw. The judges, unsure about whether they should believe her or not, go to look for Bob. While they do so, Jake and Julie see the pinata, and Jake goes to open it. right before he smashes it, the pinata grabs him and rips out his testicles while it beats Julie to death. Paul is later killed and Kyle and Tina reconcile. A new group of Kyle, Tina, Doug, Carmen, and Lisa now leave when they see Bob ripped in half on a tree. Doug is hanged by the pinata. As Carmen and Lisa go back, Lisa takes a bathroom break right before Carmen gets her head chopped off. Monica finds Kyle and Tina. Lisa makes it to the camp and thinks Larry and Connie are in there just before she is killed by the pinata. Kyle, Tina, and Monica kill the pinata by blowing it up by a molotov cocktail.
