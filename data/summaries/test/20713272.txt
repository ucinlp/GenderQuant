Maïté  is the devoted young wife of Vincent , who is serving 7 years in prison for an unspecified crime. She brings Vincent clean clothes, and puts money in his canteen account. She and Vincent obviously still need each other sexually, and it is difficult for both of them to be separated. One day Maïté is approached by a young man named Jean , who says his brother is also incarcerated for 7 years. They quickly embark on a sexual relationship, but Maïté is cold and unresponsive. She has a good relationship with her neighbour, Djamila, who has a small son, Julien. Maïté looks after him frequently whilst Djamila is at work, and the two are close. Eventually Maïté discovers that Jean is in fact a guard at her husband's prison. The affair takes a turn when Vincent finds out; instead of stopping them, he insists Jean tape their meetings. He advises Jean how to move Maïté emotionally and sexually, however, Jean tells him "she is empty". As Jean falls in love with Maïté, she tries to distance herself from both of them. However as Jean leaves to take up a post in Lille, Vincent attempts suicide and in final scene she is seen walking confidently into the prison to visit him once again.
