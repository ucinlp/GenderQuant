With Soumitra Chatterjee as a narrator, the documentary begins by showcasing some of the drawings by Sukumar Ray, drawn for the children books Abol Tabol, HaJaBaRaLa and a short story, Heshoram Hushiarer Diary . Explaining the lineage of Ray family starting from Hari Krishna Roy Chowdhury and Upendrakishore Ray, the documentary describes initial days of Sukumar Ray, his formation of the "Nonsense Group" in the college and publication of handwritten humorous magazine, "Thirty Two and a Half Fries". Utpal Dutt enacts as a teacher from Ray's first published poetical "nonsense"-play Jhala Pala  and provides humorous explanation/translation of the sentence "I go up, we go down" in Bengali. Soumitra Chatterjee appears as Rama, the avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu, in a spoof based on an Indian epic Ramayana, Lakshmaner Shaktishel . The spoof is based on Rama's dream about the central antagonist of the Ramayana, the demon-king Ravana and the spy  providing further information about it. The documentary also focusses on Ray's college days in London while studying photography, lithography and his meeting with Nobel Prize winning litt√©rateur, Rabindranath Tagore. While narrating his first poem Khichudi  published in children's magazine, Sandesh, launched by his father, the documentary explains how entire Ray family worked together for the growth of the magazine after Upendrakishore Ray passed away. Mentioning his association with Brahmo Samaj, the documentary ends with Sukumar Ray's terminal disease and his death on September 10, 1923.
