The Pink Panther encounters a coin-operated talking weight and fortune machine which suggests that he bring it home with him on the basis of it being a valuable asset, able to provide weather forecasts and sports scores and predict the future whenever the panther so-desires. The Pink Panther assents to the machine's proposal, but whenever the machine is on the verge of disclosing expected important information, it goes silent, requiring the panther to insert a dime in the machine's coin slot. Besides, the information is not helpful in improving the panther's condition as a safe falls on top of the Pink Panther after the machine foresees a fortune "com way", "back payment from a rear" is really a painful impact onto him from behind by a speeding car, and the panther refuses to believe the machine's statement that his future is "in the bag", the result being instant wealth for a man who picks up from a street a sack of money that the Pink Panther would have owned had he heeded the machine's prescience. A woman who gets insulted be the machine when she uses it tries to sic her dog on the machine, but the dog's basic instincts cause it to attack the Pink Panther instead. The rope with which the Pink Panther pulls the machine up a hill breaks, and the machine rolls down the hill and off of a city pier. The Pink Panther, knowing no good will come of this, declines to save it from drowning, instead dropping an anvil onto it to hasten its submergence into the water.
