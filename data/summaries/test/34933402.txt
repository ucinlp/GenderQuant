Omar is a young and lively, rather macho Algerian who holds a good job in the Department of Frauds and lives in a crowded apartment with his sisters, his mother and grandparents. He loves to listen to Arabian and Indian music, to party with his friends, and to dream about women. A friend of his gives him a tape; when he listens to it, he is fascinated by the womanâ€™s voice. That same friend arranges for him to meet the woman, who is totally different from what he had imagined on hearing her voice.
