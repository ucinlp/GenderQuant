Amply-contoured mortuary cosmetician, Grace Hart , rides the subway everyday. Her somewhat unhappy existence is noted as she shops in a department store with her best friend, Keri , and is rudely asked to please look at their "Large Ladies Department". That same night she and Keri are at a local skating ring when a young, attractive, amateur ice skater, Rob , catches Grace's eye; she claims that he is the most beautiful man she has ever laid eyes on. The following morning, Grace is wrapping a wedding present  for her father, Al's , supermarket wedding. Grace's new stepmother, Wanda , claims to care but her sweet-talking attitude somehow always ends up insulting Grace instead of helping. When Grace is caught overindulging at the wedding, Wanda and Al express their concerns with "Grace, you have such a pretty face, but, if you don't lose weight, you never will find a boyfriend". To shut Wanda up, Grace lies and states that she already has a boyfriend. A surprised Wanda stares as she claims that she and Al would love to meet him. On her way home, Grace is riding the subway when she notices that Rob is a New York City subway conductor. After following him around town a bit, she discovers that he is in a relationship with a woman named Olivia . Grace observes the relationship as being rocky, with Olivia behaving in a very overbearing manner toward non-confrontational Rob. She decides to win Rob over, and eventually manages a meeting with him after his girlfriend leaves town to visit her family for the Christmas holidays. This meeting blossoms into a full-fledged romance, one that is lamented by Grace's overly pessimistic best friend Keri . After Rob leaves for a New Year's party with Grace, Olivia arrives home to an empty house. She asks around at the ice rink where Rob likes to practice skating, where Keri reveals his secret relationship, along with their location that evening. Olivia in a fit of rage, confronts Rob and Grace at the club where he is partying, and beats Grace to the ground. The story concludes with Rob realizing that Olivia refuses to accept him as he is and that he truly loves Grace.
