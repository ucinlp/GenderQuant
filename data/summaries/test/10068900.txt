 A German commander, Von Vulture, is fuming and spluttering furiously about how many American commandos have managed to slip into Germany undetected, and he gets a telegram from the "Gestinko Gestapo", threatening him with his 'ka-rear' if he lets 'vun' more 'kommando' through. Hearing an American warplane overhead, he calls in a soldier, Schultz, whom he abuses by knocking him regularly over his helmet with a mallet. Schultz and Von Vulture go outside and use a searchlight to look for Daffy, who is floating down on a parachute, whilst singing in a Cockney accent. After a quick shout of "Put out those lights!" gets the searchlight turned off temporarily and allows him to land unseen, Daffy uses his fingers on the searchlight's lens to make shadows of animated puppets and dancing chorus girls on the clouds to distract the Germans. When Von Vulture chases Daffy behind a curtain that says "asbestos", Daffy makes a face similar to the stereotypical Japanese faces used in cartoons at the time , causing Von Vulture to run off frightened. Back at his bunker, Von Vulture is presented with a bomb from Daffy, ticking down. Von Vulture hands the bomb off to Schultz, who is literally blown through the roof. When Schultz falls back, Daffy stops Von Vulture from hitting Schultz over the head with a mallet, and instead hits him. Von Vulture  chases Daffy to a telephone booth, where Daffy continues to make fun of Von Vulture, such as nicknaming him "Von Limburger" after the infamously foul-smelling cheese. Daffy then jumps in a plane, narrowly avoiding being shot by "a whole mess of Messerschmitts", when he's shot down by Von Vulture . Daffy then runs into what he believes is a tunnel where he can hide, but it turns out to be the barrel of a huge howitzer cannon, and Daffy is then shot out by Von Vulture. However, Daffy flies unharmed  into Berlin, where Adolf Hitler is making a speech to his people. Daffy jumps up and whacks Hitler on the head with a mallet, causing the FÃ¼hrer to scream "SCHULTZ!!!" in pain.
