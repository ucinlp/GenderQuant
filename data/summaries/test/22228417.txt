Set in today's São Paulo, the film tells the story of Nina, a poor young girl, disorderly seeking a means of survival in today's cruel society and only comes across adversity. She lives in a rented room. Her landlady Eulália, an old and decrepit reincarnation of the old miser killed by Raskólnikov on Crime and Punishment, humiliates her the entire time, violates her correspondence, confiscates the money her mother sends, locks up the refrigerator to prevent her access the food stored there, each one of them with the label "Eulália" on it, a symbol of the purchasing power, the right to consume and of the humiliation of the fellow man.
