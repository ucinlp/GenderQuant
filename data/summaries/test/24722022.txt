In the contemporary era , two Cuban tourists make a stop at the provincial town of Perales . They are curious when they see two small memorials surrounded by rocks on the corner of a street. Meanwhile, two elderly veterans of the Mexican Revolution, Chelelo  and Cornelio , come out to receive them. They explain to the tourists about the memorials and to whom are they in memory of. Chelelo then recounts the story of two revolutionary friends, Sub-lieutenant Valente Quintero  and Major Atanacio Pizarro , who are fighting a battle in one of Perales' residential streets. Valente is shot in front of the late General Gumercindo Carrillo's home where his widow do침a Elvira Pe침a, daughter Leonor, and housemaid Carmen currently reside. Leonor witnesses Valente's casualty and is decided to go out and help him, against do침a Elvira's will. Leonor then explains to her mother that she is returning a favor that could have been done to her father who died while bleeding helplessly in a forest. After, Leonor runs across the street to get the never-sober Doctor Pl치cido. Then Elvira, Carmen, and Leonor take a hand to bring Valente into the house. Valente stays ill in bed for several days, when his friend Atanacio later receives word about his survival. Atanacio is captivated by the elegant, sophisticated Leonor and admires the conservative sharp-tongued matron Elvira. Antonio and Leonor also start a romantic relationship, which leads them to marriage. Atanacio, who is now a rich, alcoholic landowner duels Antonio for the love of Leonor on the night of his honeymoon. The conflict ends in both Valente and Atanacio being killed by one another.
