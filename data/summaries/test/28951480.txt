Alex is an aspiring actress, working as a waiter to make ends meet while she prepares to audition for a TV soap opera. To earn some extra money, she agrees to house-sit the home of friends for the weekend. The friends feel obligated to let Alex know that a robbery and murder has recently taken place at the house next door. Although she pretends to be unconcerned, Alex is understandably on edge when a stranger, Mickey, turns up at the house. He is a thief who holds her captive, but has a way about him that attracts Alex as well.
