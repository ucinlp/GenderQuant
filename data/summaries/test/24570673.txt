After a long night of partying, Bobby Moore and four of his friends drive over a bridge and, not paying attention, crash into a truck, killing them instantly. His father, Shaw Moore , the reverend of the church of the small Southern United States town of Bomont, Georgia, persuades the city council to pass several paternalistic laws, including a ban on all unsupervised dancing within the city limits as well as a by-law curfew. Three years later, Ren McCormack , a teenager raised in Boston, moves to Bomont to live with his uncle, aunt, and cousins after his mother's painful death from leukemia. Soon after arriving, Ren makes friends with Willard Hewitt , a fellow senior at Bomont High School, and from him learns about the ban on dancing. He soon begins to be attracted to Moore's rebellious daughter Ariel , who is dating dirt-track driver Chuck Cranston, whose father owns the local race-track . After an insult from Chuck, Ren ends up in a game involving buses, and despite his inability to drive a bus, he wins. Reverend Moore mistrusts Ren, forbidding Ariel to see him ever again. Ren and his classmates want to do away with the law and have a senior prom. After a while, Ariel begins to fall for Ren and breaks up with Chuck, telling him she's sick of him treating her like dirt. In result, he beats her up, bruising her face. After hearing of Ariel's beaten condition, Moore meets up with Ariel and his wife, Vi, at the church and instantly thinks Ren was the one who had beaten his daughter. When he declares he wants Ren arrested, Ariel tells him that he can't blame everything on Ren just like he did with Bobby, who died in the car crash. She goes on to say how Bobby spent his entire life trying to make him proud but he was never good enough for him; and now no one remembers the good things about Bobby, only the bad. After she bitterly reveals to having lost her virginity, Moore slaps her across the face, prompting Ariel to flee from the church, her mother going after her who tells Moore he's "done enough". Vi is supportive of the movement to allow dancing. She explains to Moore he cannot be everyone's father, and that he is hardly being a good father to Ariel. She also says that dancing and music are not the problem. Ren goes before the city council and reads several Bible verses, given to him by Ariel, that describe how in ancient times people would dance to rejoice, exercise, celebrate, and/or worship, hoping to lift the dancing ban. Meanwhile, Ren also teaches Willard how to dance. The city council votes against him. Undaunted, Ren convinces the owner of the cotton mill where he works to let them have a prom there; the mill is just outside the Bomont city limits. Ren goes to see Moore, knowing that Moore still has enough influence to pressure the parents not to let their teenagers come. Ren tells Moore that even though they denied the motion to dismiss the law, they cannot stop the teenagers from having the first senior prom, which has always been denied. He then asks him respectfully if he can take Ariel. Moore, after some thought, allows Ariel to go and makes amends with his wife and daughter, better understanding things. On Sunday, Shaw asks his congregation to pray for the high school students putting on the prom. Not long after Ren and Ariel arrive at the prom, Chuck and several of his friends ride up, intent on beating up Ren and Willard for an earlier fight in the movie. However, Ren and Willard fend them off along with Rusty and Ariel's help. Ren then flings some confetti into a shredding machine and yells, "Let's dance!" The movie ends with everyone dancing in the barn to the song from the opening credits, "Footloose".
