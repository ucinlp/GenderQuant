On a quiet, suburban street in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, and in the middle of the afternoon on a summer's day in 1982, Clive Holden witnessed the murder of a teenaged girl as she was killed by a sniper's bullet. A year later, Holden returned to the scene of the senseless slaying to lie with his camera on the spot where she died, in order to film and capture the effect of her tragic and sudden death. The film is so titled in reference to the statistic that the average sixteen-year-old has already witnessed 18,000 murders, on television and at the movies. The locale of Gordon Head is the Canadian suburb where the murder happened, and where the film thus takes place.
