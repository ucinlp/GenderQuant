Linda  wakes up one morning to her ringing phone. Her friend, Gale  wants to know how her party went last night. To her dismay, Linda tells her that no one showed up. "Not a one." Thus begins Denise Calls Up, the story of seven friends living in New York City who no longer find it necessary to actually meet face to face due to the new age of the internet and wireless phones. But Gale is less upset about the absolute absenteeism, than about the fact that her friend Barbara  never got to meet Jerry . Gale has been trying to set them up. So she calls Barbara, chastising her for not making it to Linda's and goading her into meeting Jerry. After protesting that she's just been too busy, Barbara eventually acquieces. Meanwhile, Denise , who has gotten pregnant by an anonymous sperm insemination, locates the donor, Martin  and decides to call him. And so it goes, as the characters, via phone and fax, duck and miss each other time after time, using one excuse after the other to avoid meetings, births, and even a funeral until, finally, Frank  determined to finally get everyone together, plans a New Year's Eve party. All swear that they will be there.
