However, when the Japanese attack Singapore, the hotel where she is waiting for him is bombed; Gordon searches frantically in the wreckage, but cannot find her. He is forced to sail away on his schooner. With the end of the war, Gordon returns after five years and is met by Deputy Commissioner Hewitt , who is convinced he has returned for a hidden cache of pearls. So are Gordon's old criminal associates, Mr. Mauribus  and his underling Sascha Barda ([[George Lloyd . Mauribus offers to buy the pearls, but Gordon denies he has any. Then, to his shock, Gordon sees Linda. However, she denies knowing him. She cannot remember anything prior to waking up in a hospital during the war. After spending years together in a prison camp with plantation owner Michael Van Leyden , she married him. Gordon tries to help her remember her past, but to no avail. She does, however, go to see Linda's pre-war servant, Ming Ling . Ming Ling recognizes her, but her memories are still blocked. Giving up, Gordon retrieves the pearls from his old hotel room and hides them in the luggage of the current occupants, American tourists Mr. and Mrs. Bellows . Hewitt questions and searches him after seeing him exit the room, but discovers nothing. However, he informs Gordon that Ann Van Leyden is missing. Gordon goes to Mauribus. He deceives Mauribus and Sascha into believing that Linda double crossed him and has the pearls. They take him, at gunpoint, to her. He pulls out a gun taped to his ankle and dispatches the two crooks. In the excitement, Ann is knocked unconscious. Gordon takes her back to her husband. The blow restores Ann's memories. She is willing to resume her life with Michael, but he confesses he knew all about her past. With her happiness in mind, he drives her to airport. At the airport, not only is Gordon's luggage thoroughly searched, but so are the bags of the Bellows. Giving up, he tells Hewitt where the pearls are. Hewitt lets him board the plane, which takes off just before Linda arrives. Spotting her, Hewitt has the aircraft return.
