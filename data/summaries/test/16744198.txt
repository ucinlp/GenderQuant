Paul Porterfield  is an 18-year-old music student who is offered the chance to be the page turner for the acclaimed pianist Richard Kennington . Kennington, and his agent and lover Joseph Mansourian , is instantly attracted to Paul's youth and attractiveness, but Kennington's attempts to get to know Paul better are thwarted by Paul's possessive, neurotic mother, Pamela  who is initially unaware of the attraction. She dotes on her son but is faced with the revelation that her husband is cheating on her and the exasperation of her son, who feels suffocated by her love. Paul is keen to escape his mother and meets Kennington in a hotel; After talking Kennington offers Paul a massage which leads on to other things. After meeting up again in Barcelona, the two begin an affair behind the back of Pamela and Mansourian who consistently attempts to contact Kennington after his dog dies to no avail. On the last day before Kennington returns to New York, and Pamela and Paul head on to Grenada, Pamela makes excuses and goes to Kennington's hotel to seduce him, but he is clearly not interested. While consoling herself in the bathroom, she finds a pair of her son's boxer shorts hanging up. After Kennington returns to New York, and Pamela and Paul head on to Grenada, the affair seems over. Six months later Paul, now at Music College and in a relationship with another older man, meets Mansourian again who invites him to page turn at a private event, where he later seduces Paul unaware of his previous connection with Kennington. Again his mother is unaware, but while cleaning Paul's room after he returns for Christmas, she finds a photo of Kennington, with a love note written on the back, in his suitcase. She attempts to confront Paul and later Kennington as the revelations are faced by Paul, Pamela, Kennington and Mansourian.
