Mark Furness , once a successful architect, finds it increasingly difficult to control his "bad habits", such as climbing stairs in a strange sequence, swearing involuntarily and washing himself compulsively. His wife, Stevie  asks him to leave their home, so he seeks solace with his best friends Nathan  and Kathy  to take him under their wing. His life gets even worse when, at a meeting with his employers, he finds himself swearing uncontrollably and loses his job. Accepting he is unwell, Mark visits a doctor already convinced he is suffering from a brain tumour or meningitis. In the doctor's waiting room another patient, Charlotte , recognises Mark's "habits" as symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and Tourette syndrome, and invites him to a local self-help group she runs. Mark finds it comforting that others share his disorder and with Charlotte's help, hopes to face his problems and win his wife back. Mark tries to beat his disease and is making some progress despite learning his wife is petitioning him for divorce. While meeting her to discuss terms - after covering himself in chocolate powder to combat his obsessive cleanliness - Mark and Stevie have sex. Mark interprets this as a sign that they will be reunited, but Charlotte warns it is nothing but "sympathy sex", leading to an argument between the friends. Mark storms off but realises Charlotte may be right when he sees Stevie with another man in their marital house. This plunges Mark into depression. His disorders deteriorate and, cutting contact with his friends completely, he moves into a rundown bedsit. His situation gets worse still when  he begins to stalk Stevie, convinced she has begun a relationship with another man. Almost unrecognisable, he even attacks his friend Nathan on the street because he thinks Stevie is having an affair with him. At his lowest point, Mark learns the truth about Stevie and her new relationship. The story ends with Mark still suffering from his symptoms, but Charlotte re-enters his life and they begin a romantic relationship themselves. Charlotte, able to accept Mark as he is, provides the support for Mark to continue his battle.
