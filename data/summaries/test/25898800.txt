He starts performing the “icepick lobotomy” on alcoholics, veterans, and other troubled outsiders. Billy is concerned with his wife’s obsession. He directs his wife to a fake clinic fronted by Tom, a Korean War veteran on Billy’s payroll who masquerades as a neurologist. Tom convinces Anna to delay the procedure and visit him that night. Tom and Anna share their traumas with one another and grow closer. Billy finds them together and sets off a final conflict that draws the film to a close.
