Wilde, whose character is never named, plays a professional guide leading a white man  and his troupe on an elephant hunt through the African veldt during the colonial era. When the group intrudes on a local tribe's territory, some natives politely accost them, expecting to be bought off with gifts. Although the guide advises his client to be courteous, warning "they could give us a bad time," the client refuses to offer anything and insults the natives, sending them away empty-handed. Later, the tribe returns en masse, captures the entire party, and puts the captives to death, using various cruel and unusual methods. One man is covered in clay and roasted alive on a spit; another is tarred, feathered, and trussed, then chased and killed by all the women. The man who insulted the tribesmen is trapped in a ring of fire with a poisonous snake. Wilde's character is spared until the last. He is stripped naked and given a brief head start, then chased by some of the tribesmen. With a combination of luck, cunning, and desperation, he eludes the warriors, killing several; finds food and water; and, after many days, returns to a colonial fort just seconds ahead of his pursuers. As he reaches safety, the man turns and exchanges a salute with their leader . Although the story is violent, there are a few scenes of tenderness and humor after the man is rescued from drowning by an African girl, who travels with him for a day or two. As they walk along, he sings a nineteenth-century drinking song, "Little Brown Jug", and the child sings a song in her own language; they then attempt to sing each other's songs. The soundtrack consists of African tribal chants, natural sounds, and occasional dialog, in English and otherwise. There are no subtitles; incidental music is also mostly absent. Five of the ten actors playing the tribal hunters were cast together in the 1965 South African film Diamond Walkers.
