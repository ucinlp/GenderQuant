The film is based on the letters Giuseppe Conlon wrote from prison to his wife Sarah after he was convicted in 1976 along with six members of the Maguire family of running an IRA bomb factory in North London. Conlon received twelve years imprisonment, but died in custody in 1980. Sarah Conlon spent many years campaigning to clear the names of her husband, and son Gerry . The others jailed along with Giuseppe Conlon were later released after serving their sentences, and the convictions were quashed on appeal in 1991. The Guildford Four had their convictions overturned in 1989.
