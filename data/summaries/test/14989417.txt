In German-occupied Paris, an announcer reports during a blackout that the Second Front has begun, with British forces invading the Continent, and that five Royal Air Force fighters have been shot down. The downed pilots split up and make their way to Paris to try to arrange their escape back to England. On the way, they break into a tavern in search of civilian clothes. When a German soldier shows up for a drink, Squadron Leader Paul Lavallier , a member of the Free French, knocks him out and takes his money. In Paris, Paul contacts an old teacher of his, Father Antoine , who agrees to hide the reunited men in the sewers underneath his cathedral. "Baby" , one of the others, has been shot in the shoulder along the way. When he slumps over in the church, it attracts the attention of a Gestapo agent . Paul manages to distract him, allowing Baby to slip away, but then the German starts following Paul. Paul tries to hide in a caf√©, where he is served by Joan , but the agent finds him. In his haste to get away, the airman tears the sleeve of Joan's dress. He then enters the first unlocked room he can find in a nearby building. By chance, it is Joan's. She discovers him hiding in her closet when she goes to change. To allay her fears, he tells her that Father Antoine sent him to give her enough money to buy a new dress. He persuades her to deliver a message to Father Antoine, describing his predicament. As they begin working together, they fall in love. Later, Paul gets Father Antoine to visit a British spy  who has been caught and is to be executed. The priest is able to overcome the doomed man's suspicions and obtains the name of a contact, schoolteacher Mademoiselle Rosay . Because the church is being watched by the persistent Gestapo agent, Father Antoine asks the unsuspected Joan to meet Rosay. However, on the way there, she passes the shop where she bought her new garment. A second Gestapo man  has traced the bank note she used as payment to the robbed soldier and follows her. She and Mademoiselle Rosay barely escape capture. Rosay arranges for a seaplane to land at night on the Seine River to pick up the men. Gestapo head Herr Funk  plays a cat and mouse game with Joan and Paul. When Paul is picked up for not having any identification papers, Funk apologizes for the inconvenience and releases him so he can lead the Germans to the others. That night, Paul finally tells Joan his real identity. He promises to marry her when the war is over. However, he is unable to shake the Gestapo agent, so Joan takes the map of the rendezvous point to the others. While they wait for the appointed time, Baby dies of his wound. Meanwhile, Paul finally manages to kill the Gestapo man in a Turkish bath, but too late to reach the rendezvous in time. Funk then offers Joan a devil's bargain: Paul's life if she leads him to the hiding place of the other men. She agrees. Finding Paul praying in the cathedral, she tells him that the others are still waiting for him. She then leads Funk on a wild goose chase, giving the airmen time to make good their escape. Later, she faces the firing squad bravely.
