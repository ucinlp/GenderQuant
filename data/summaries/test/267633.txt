The film documents how Ry Cooder, long-time friend of Wenders, brought together legendary Cuban musicians to record an album (also called [[Buena Vista Social Club , and to perform a concert in the United States. Although they are geographically close, travel between Cuba and the United States is restricted due to the political tension between the two countries, so many of the artists were travelling there for the first time. The film shows their reactions to this experience, as well as including footage of the resultant sell-out concert. It also includes interviews with each of the main performers.
