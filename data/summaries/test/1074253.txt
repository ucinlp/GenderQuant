The Rocket Power gang  accompany paterfamilias Raymundo Rocket and his business partner Tito Makani to O'ahu for a well-deserved vacation, the occasion being a reunion of Tito's extended family . Otto becomes fixated on the prospect of surfing the North Shore's Banzai Pipeline. The kids hook up with young Makani cousins Keoni and Leilani  who take them on a cross-country bicycle race where they discover one of the menehunes' heiau, from which Sam in a crucial shot greedily and covertly pilfers a small statue. Once the gang has settled in, Ray is smitten by Tito's cousin Noelani , who was best friends with his late wife Danielle  who died when Otto and Reggie were very little. Spending lots of quality time together, the two suddenly become over protective: a planned horseback riding outing becomes a pony ride; the kids already wearing helmets and gloves for an ATV excursion are issued jackets and pads and told to go slow; a planned helicopter tour is foregone due to wind. It is revealed that Noelani some years ago had been tandem-surfing Pipe with her partner, who disappeared in the ocean after their surfboard broke in a bad wipeout; hence her cautious nature.  In a canoe race, Ray elects to remain ashore with Noelani, leaving Tito and the "foursome" to crew a six-person boat. Complicating matters further, Sam is frightened by the appearance of a jellyfish. Strangely, this results in the wooden  boat eventually sinking out from under them. In other instances, Otto has two close calls. The first was in a surfing wipeout. Then he is dragged into deep water while hanging onto a turtle when free-diving but is rescued by Reggie. While at their treehouse accommodations at the Makani ranch, Twister's precious camcorder and favorite swim trunks go missing, forcing him to employ some humorous and drastic counter-measures. Sam begins to think, at first privately, that the menehune are responsible for what's going on, and that his taking the statue was the proximate cause of all these untoward occurrences.  The entourage eventually visits the Pipeline when it's in a particularly rough mood. Raymundo declares a well-informed no-go. Otto &mdash; and then Reggie &mdash; begin to act out, and on another day decide to surf the Pipeline on their own, the sibs getting washed into a shoreside cave in a scenario eerily reminiscent of a well-publicised January 1993 incident. Raymundo goes in after them, and the three are eventually rescued due to Twister's vigilance . The film is notable in the Rocket Power canon for revealing  the appearance and given name of Otto and Reggie's late mother, which for a long time remained a subject of curiosity among the show's fans . A character stating in the context of an episode that someone important had died also appears to have lifted a long-standing Nickelodeon taboo on the use of the word "death". The film ends as Raymundo reveals to Tito his plans to ask Noelani for her hand in marriage, leading into Rocket Power: The Big Day.
