Rick Jarmin  helped convict a drug dealing FBI agent named Eugene Sorenson  and was placed in the witness protection program. 15 years later his former fianc√© Marianne Graves  crosses paths with him at a gas station in Detroit, Michigan. Rick refuses to recognize Marianne as the witness protection program does not allow contact with people from the witness' previous life. If she recognizes him it may lead to Sorenson finding and killing him. Sorenson has been let out of jail after serving his sentence and with his partner Albert Diggs  they are out to kill Rick in order to smooth the passage of their latest deal with some Columbian drug dealers. Marianne has blown Rick's cover and he makes a frantic call to his relocation officer for a new identity only to discover that his old contact has retired. His new contact, Joe Weyburn , is in league with Diggs and Sorenson. Just as Marianne prepares to confront Rick they are surprised by Sorenson and Diggs who show up at the gas station with guns blazing. They kill Rick's kindly old boss at the gas station pinning the murder on Rick and Marianne who are forced to go on the run. The climax of the film takes place at a zoo, where Sorenson and his men get killed by different animals. Meanwhile, Rick, who suffered a gunshot wound, makes a promise to Marianne that he wants to marry her. In the end, he does and the two of them enjoy a vacation in the Caribbean.
