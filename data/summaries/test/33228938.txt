Krazy Kat and his spaniel girlfriend are singing and dancing at the beach. As they do their rhythmic leisure, they also roast some sausages for lunch above a bonfire. But because the fire was too close to the shore, waves came by, putting out the flames and washing away their food. To startover, Krazy picks up some driftwood in the vicinity and lights them. The cat and the dog resume what they were doing. Following their trip to the beach, Krazy and the spaniel head to a carnival. The two then decided to start with the roller coaster which the spaniel was quick to take seat. But while Krazy was still outside trying to pay for the ride, the coaster operator suddenly sneezes, therefore blowing the coaster away, much to the girl mutt's panic. Krazy scales up the elevated the tracks to rescue his sweetheart. After chasing the coaster for a number of yards, the cat was able to get on board but wondered how he could stop it. The coaster eventually came off the tracks and onto the fairgrounds where it ran through some tents and a tunnel of mirrors. Upon reaching the tunnel's exit, the runaway railway vehicle finally drops into a shallow pond, thus spilling out its passengers. Down on their bottoms, Krazy and the spaniel were daze but also relieved from their nightmarish ride.
