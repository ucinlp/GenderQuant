In order to own an entire slum area of Los Angeles so he can tear it down, a callous, rich businessman, Goddard Bolt , CEO of Bolt Enterprises, makes a bet with his biggest rival, Vance Crasswell  At no time can he reveal to any of the slum area residents that he is Goddard Bolt. If he succeeds, Bolt will gain the neighborhood for almost nothing. Crasswell schemes to make Bolt's stay on the streets as bad as can be. Bolt, homeless, hungry and filthy, is befriended by skid-row inhabitants like Sailor  and Fumes  and given the nickname "Pepto" after falling asleep in a crate with a Pepto-Bismol logo on its side. In the process, he also falls in love with Molly , a homeless woman who used to be a dancer on Broadway. During a scuffle with two muggers, Bolt is pushed out of bounds. To prevent his anklet from activating, he charges back in towards the thugs, which impresses Molly with his supposed bravery. Bolt learns important life lessons during his 'adventure,' unaware that the unscrupulous Crasswell has no intention of honoring their bet, the latter having bribed Bolt's lawyers into fabricating the story that Bolt had lost his mind.
