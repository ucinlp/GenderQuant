When they return to school, Lola discovers that Chad has cheated on her over the summer. Lola lies about meeting someone else and the two break up.

When Kyle and Lola realize the feelings they have for each other they pursue a relationship. To make matters more complicated with Chad and Kyle being friends and the high school 'post it note' Ashley wants to be with Kyle. When Lola looks for Kyle she is told he is in the bathroom but when she overhears two people in the toilets together she assumes it is Kyle and Ashley from seeing a purse on the floor the same as Ashley's. Lola confronts Ashley who does not deny it. A huge fight breaks out where Lola accuses Kyle of cheating like Chad did. Kyle is astonished that she thinks that this would happen, causing them to break up.
