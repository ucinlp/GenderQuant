In a small Czech town named Jilemnice lives an unfortunate but brave and jovial woman Štěpa Kiliánová, whose only desire was to fill the void in her virgin life. Out of despair and excessive trust, she marries a sardonic, reclusive man, former lieutenant and gambler Pavel Malina, whose only wish is to find peace and forget the past. They live through unrequited love, dislike and disappointment. But no one knows that her groom is showing signs of cerebral disease, which engulfs his sanity.
