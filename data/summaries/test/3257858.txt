{{Plot}} The film opens with Francie "Gidget" Lawrence  and Jeff "Moondoggie" Matthews  on their surfboards in the water, Gidget is overjoyed that Jeff is on vacation from college. This leads to the opening credits and shows a montage of the two together. While at breakfast one morning, Gidget's father Russ  announces that they are going to vacation in Hawaii. Gidget, unlike most girls, hates surprises and wishes he had told her sooner, so they could have delayed the trip. Gidget refuses to go, and runs out the door. Gidget's mother Dorothy , explains to her husband that Jeff is all that matters to Gidget. Russ and Dorothy decide to cancel Gidget's room reservation and keep one just for the two of them, so they can have a second honeymoon and Gidget can stay home with Jeff. Meanwhile Gidget goes to the beach, and tells Moondoggie about going to Hawaii. Jeff thinks it's great and says she should go. Gidget is surprised by this response and thinks that their relationship means nothing to Jeff. She returns his pin and runs off, leaving an upset, confused and frustrated Moondoggie on the beach. She also decides to go to Hawaii to forget about Jeff. So the Lawrence family packs up and flies to Hawaii. While on the plane Gidget meets Abby Stewart  whose family is staying at the same hotel. Gidget's parents and Abby's parents Monty  and Mitzi  are talking at the front of the plane. They both learn that Eddie Horner  a popular dancer is performing at a theaterâ€“restaurant next to their hotel. They also meet three more men named Judge , Larry , and Wally . Abby enjoys the fact that they will all be at the same hotel but Gidget barely reacts. Abby figures out that Gidget has just broken up and asks her to tell the story. Gidget does, but in an overly dramatic way. She says it was love at first sight . She then goes on to say that she went overboard and "surrendered herself completely," which Abby interprets to mean that she went all the way. Gidget then tells Abby that she used to call him "Moondoggie" which Abby finds very strange as well. When they reach Hawaii, Gidget's parents have to get a separate room for Gidget instead of a connecting one, because they canceled the previous reservation. While everyone else is enjoying Hawaii and having fun, Gidget stays in her room and mopes all day. Abby is toying with all the boys' emotions, but especially Eddie Horner's, as he is the one she likes best. He seems to like Abby too, but has also found an interest in Gidget. Gidget's father feels bad and decides to send a message to Jeff, telling him that Gidget is miserable, and it would make her feel better if he  flew down there. Once Jeff learns this he immediately accepts. That night Abby visits Gidget, and invites her to dine with Eddie, Judge, Larry and Wally and Herself. Abby decided to go with all of them, because she didn't want to choose. Gidget declines and says she'd be happier if she stayed in her room. Once Abby leaves, Gidget's mom enters and says she feels bad but Gidget should enjoy her time there and have fun with Abby and the boys . Gidget agrees and says she'll be there soon. While at the restaurant, Abby is annoyed that she can't be alone with Eddie, so she finds two other girls named Barbara Jo and DeeDee to accompany them. Once they are there Abby gets to talk to Eddie alone while Wally, Judge and Larry argue over Barbara Jo and DeeDee. Meanwhile Gidget's and Abby's parents are also at the restaurant  and are talking when Russ receives a telegram that Jeff is taking the first plane out. Back at the other table Eddie asks Abby why her friend couldn't join them. Abby replies that she just wasn't interested. While she says this we see Gidget appear all dressed up to join them, much to the surprise of Abby, the boys, and Gidget's father. All the guys including Eddie are now completely drawn to her much to the anger of Abby. Finally they announce the time to dance where Eddie automatically grabs Gidget's hand, leaving an angry Abby and an overjoyed Judge to dance. Gidget and Eddie seem to hit it off. Later that night in Gidget's hotel room, Abby comes back in and explains to Gidget how she was annoyed that Gidget just came in like that and didn't even mention Abby inviting her. Gidget is unaware of how annoyed Abby is and replies that she was only doing her mom a favor. The next day we see Gidget surfing, and again a very annoyed Abby looks on because Abby hates the water and refuses to go in . Gidget also neglected to tell Abby that she surfs. The guys watch in amazement as Gidget shows off her surfing moves. They then join Gidget, and Eddie asks her for surfing lessons. On his first attempt he wipes out. After that, Eddie and Gidget run back on shore, where they are alone and Eddie kisses her. Gidget pulls away at first, but goes back to kissing him. Right at that very moment, Jeff appears but then claims he mistook her for another girl. After he leaves, Eddie tries to go back and kiss Gidget, but she pushes him away and runs after Moondoggie. Gidget and Moondoggie get into a fight and decide to go their separate ways. That night they're all at dinner when Abby arrives with Jeff . Gidget tries to make Jeff jealous by flirting with Eddie. They also begin a conversation about things being tame and Judge tells Gidget that she should try water skiing  and Gidget says she will. The next day everyone is at the ski jump but only Gidget dares to attempt it. She seems to do well, but once she gets to the jump she lets go of the handle, and goes crashing into the water. Jeff and Judge get in a boat and save her. While in the boat going back to join the others, Gidget flirts with Judge and agrees to go with him that night to watch Eddie perform, all in the presence of Jeff. The next day they are all on a boat and Gidget acts offended by a comment Abby makes about the water. So Gidget goes off to another part of the boat and Jeff follows her. He goes and tells her to cut it out, although Abby thinks Jeff now likes her. Abby decides to start a rumor about Gidget saying how she's slept with Eddie and other people, rationalizing that it is half true because Gidget had said that she gave herself "completely" to "that Moondoggie person". Abby tells her mom Mitzi who then goes and tells Gidget's mother Dorothy. Dorothy refuses to believe it and says that she thinks Abby started the rumor, and they get into an argument. Dorothy tells Russ and they both question Gidget; she denies even the thought of it. This leaves both her parents, especially her father, angry and frustrated. Dorothy and Russ get into a fight. Russ leaves and goes to the bar. Meanwhile Monty and Mitzi also get into a fight because Monty thinks Mitzi should have kept her mouth shut which results in Mitzi going down to the bar. While at the bar, Mitzi and Russ talk and realize they see eye to eye on things and have a drink. Meanwhile Monty and Dorothy talk in the hotel room and go downstairs to another bar in the hotel. After talking Russ and Mitzi decide to go to the Mauhana Room. Just as they leave, Dorothy and Monty also go to the Mauhana room, but by another route. This is all witnessed by the clerk at the desk. Meanwhile at the Luau, Abby is the center of attention, and is happy, primarily because Gidget isn't there. Eddie goes off to take a walk and bumps into Gidget who tells him of the rumor that is going around and says she doesn't want to go because she doesn't know if anyone else has heard. Eddie then pulls her aside and tells Gidget he's fallen in love with her. Gidget tells him that she doesn't like him, and that she's sorry. They agree to be friends. Gidget goes for a walk on the beach. While on the beach, Gidget pictures herself promiscuous and pregnant. Back at the Luau, Abby and Jeff are talking and Abby tells him about the rumor that Gidget sleeps around. Jeff can't believe it. Abby then admits it's a lie and she  only had one affair. Jeff asks when Gidget told her that, and Abby replies that Gidget told her on the plane, but why any girl would fall for a guy called "Moondoggie" is beyond her. Jeff then realizes how much he cares about Gidget. He tells Abby that he likes her and to call him what everyone at home calls him, "Moondoggie." Jeff runs off leaving an upset Abby at the Luau. On the beach Moondoggie and Gidget reconnect and talk about what happened on their way back to the hotel. Gidget asks the clerk if her parents were in and the clerk says Abby's Dad and Gidget's Mom went one way while Gidget's Dad and Abby's Mom went the other way. This leaves Gidget very worried and she decides to wait for them in their suite and Moondoggie accompanies her. We then see Monty, Mitzi, Russ, and Dorothy talking all together at a table. They discuss the situation, and Mitzi says she will punish Abby when they get back. Dorothy decides to call to see if Gidget is in her room, but gets no answer. When they get back to the hotel, they decide to wait for Gidget in her suite. Meanwhile Gidget is in her parents suite and is worried because she thinks her parents are cheating on each other. So she and Jeff make up a plan. In Gidget's suite, Dorothy calls all Gidget's friends asking if they saw her. The news then gets to Abby who feels horrible thinking that she caused all this. Eventually DeeDee, Abby, Abby's Parents, Eddie, Judge, Wally and Larry are all in Gidget's suite worrying about where she is. Finally Gidget's dad goes back to his suite to get something. Russ comes in to find Gidget and Moondoggie kissing on the couch. He cries out in relief, but Gidget tells him, that her Mom is asleep, but she fixed it so his bed looks slept in. But to get out of here and come back in the morning, so she won't suspect anything. Russ plays along and he and Jeff both go to Gidget's suite where Jeff sees that everyone is waiting. Russ tells Dorothy to go in and "get your half of what I got". She goes in and Gidget tells her the same thing but Dorothy goes into the bedroom and Gidget thinks her dad is not there and fears problems will arise. But to her surprise, her father is asleep in the bed. She taps him and he jumps up and yells "Boo!" Then everyone else comes in and is laughing at Gidget. Gidget laughs and kisses Jeff and tells Eddie sorry but he had no chance up against Jeff and explains to everyone what happened. All is well until Gidget realizes she has some unfinished business. The following day the gang drags Abby into the water. We see a wave come and a screaming Abby on Gidget's surfboard. Gidget just looks over to Jeff and laughs.
