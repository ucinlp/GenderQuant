The film begins with a flashforward in which Dagny Taggart crashes an airplane while following another plane. Dagny says to herself "Who is John Galt?" before crashing into the mountainside. The film returns to eight months earlier. Dagny is trying to discover how the abandoned prototype of an advanced motor she and Hank Rearden found works. Quentin Daniels, the only capable scientist who has not disappeared yet, agrees to help her from his abandoned university laboratory in Utah. Dagny's brother James Taggart, president of the family railroad, meets store clerk Cherryl Brooks and brings her to see the performance of a pianist, who disappears during his performance, leaving a note asking "Who is John Galt?" Later, during the wedding of James and Cherryl, Dagny's friend Francisco d'Anconia argues with other guests about whether money is evil, and secretly informs Rearden that his copper mine will suffer a devastating explosion the next day. Rearden spends that night with his paramour Dagny. Later he is confronted about the affair by his wife Lillian, who refuses to grant him a divorce in order to maintain her position in society. Rearden sells his advanced-material steel to Ken Danagger's coal mining company, and refuses to sell it to the government in defiance of the newly enacted "Fair Share" law that forces businesses to sell to all buyers. The two are charged under the law but Danagger disappears before trial. Rearden makes a statement at trial about the benefits of the pursuit of profit, and is given only a token penalty by the court when it is seen that the crowd supports him. However, the government announces a new law that freezes all employment and productions, and requires all patent rights to be transferred to the federal government. Government bureaucrat Wesley Mouch blackmails Rearden into giving up his Rearden Steel patents, using photos of Rearden and Dagny that would damage Dagny's reputation. Dagny leaves her COO post at the railroad when her prized John Galt line is dissembled due to lack of business. During her absence, a Taggart Transcontinental train collides with a military train in a tunnel in South Colorado, due in large part to human error by Dagny's poorly-trained replacement. Francisco tries to dissuade Dagny from returning to the railroad to supervise repairs, as he had earlier tried to talk Rearden into leaving his business, but she does nonetheless. Dagny takes a train to Colorado to show her faith in the railway. The train stops due to an engine failure. The technician who comes to fix it used to work for 20th Century Motor, which produced the motor Dagny found. The technician tells Dagny how the need-based reward system in his company failed, and his coworker John Galt left the company to "stop the motor of the world". Dagny calls Daniels, who tells her that he is quitting. Dagny buys a small airplane nearby, and flies to Utah to try to convince him not to do so. While landing, she sees the scientist get into a plane on the airstrip. After a pursuit in the air—the opening scene of the film—Dagny's plane crashes in a valley hidden by stealth technology. Dagny crawls to the edge of her crashed plane, where she is greeted by John Galt. As the screen fades, a quote from the Atlas Shrugged novel is displayed.
