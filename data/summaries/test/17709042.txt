Matthew Putnam  is summoned back to his small hometown of Rockridge by his aged, bedridden aunt Nettie  after seven years of enjoying himself in Europe. She is tired and wants him to take charge of Putnam Dairies, the family business and the town's major employer. Every mother with a marriageable daughter is excited by the return of the wealthy young man, including Mathilda Sherman . However, Matthew shows no interest in Mathilda's daughter Irene . When Matthew visits his good friend Will Oliver , he is pleasantly surprised to see how grown up and beautiful Will's daughter Marge  has become. His reluctance to remain in town evaporates as he spends more and more time with her. This does not sit well with Roy Daniels ([[Robert . When Roy makes his bid for her affections, she turns him down, so he decides to leave for New York City the next day. Marge is up all night trying to balance the church's finances, for which she and Roy are responsible. Finally, an irate Will calls over the shared telephone line and leaves an angry message for Roy to come over to straighten out the mess before he leaves town. However, eavesdroppers misinterpret the message and assume that Roy has gotten Marge pregnant and is trying to leave town without marrying her. Mathilda is delighted and bullies her husband Tom , the president of the Sherman Bank, into firing Marge. She also disqualifies Marge's winning entry in the prestigious annual flower show. Marge and Matthew are oblivious to the rumors. He asks her to marry him; she accepts, provided they elope the next day. Then they separately find out about the ugly stories being circulated about Marge. Matthew decides to teach the town a sharp lesson. He first transfers all his money out of the Sherman Bank, which would lead to its collapse, and orders the replacement of all 300 local workers with out-of-towners. Faced with the destruction of their community, the workers organize a meeting that Matthew attends. Before things get totally out of hand, Matthew's aunt Nettie shows up and gives the townsfolk a tongue-lashing for their malicious gossip by bringing up their own past misdeeds. Meanwhile, when Matthew was late for their elopement, Marge assumed he believed the stories. Will, having discovered it was his call that started the whole mess, shoots himself. Fortunately, he botches his suicide and survives with only a minor wound. Everything is eventually straightened out and the couple sneak off to a nearby town to get married. However, the chastened townspeople have not changed their ways too much it seems. A mock disagreement between the newlyweds about where they should spend their honeymoon is seen and misreported as a full-blown argument.
