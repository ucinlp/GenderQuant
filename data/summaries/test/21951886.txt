The film takes place in the United States in what is presumably the present day. A large, colossal meteorite is heading towards the Earth, and threatens to wipe out the human race in a manner similar to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Whilst the Earth begins a series of efforts to divert and later destroy the meteorite, two parents - Jason  and Ashley  - search for their missing child, who is in Los Angeles, whilst attempting to overcome various catastrophes somehow triggered by the arrival of the meteorite. As the film moves on, both Jason and Ashley soon realise that it is not advanced technology that is required to find their child or divert the meteorite, but faith in religion. The daughter is eventually reunited with her father, just at the time the meteorite is about to hit. They tell each other that they will see each other soon, and the film ends with the meteorite colliding with the earth, destroying all life.
