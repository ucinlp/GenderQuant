After her father's ship 'Hoptoad' is carried off by a sudden storm, the spunky Pippi Longstocking  is stranded with her horse, Alfonso, and her pet monkey, Mr. Nilsson, and takes up residence in the old family home, Villa Villekulla, which is thought by neighborhood children to be haunted. Soon, two children, Tommy  and his sister Annika , venture into the house only to meet up with Pippi. The three soon become friends and get into various adventures together, including cleaning the floor with scrubbing shoes, dodging the "splunks", going down a river in barrels, running away in a homemade autogyro, keeping the house from being demolished by crooks, and helping Pippi with the problem of having to go to an orphanage. Pippi eventually chooses to go after she and Tommy and Annika almost fall down a waterfall, and their parents refuse to let her play with them anymore. Pippi does not fit in with the other children and misses her parents. That night, however, she saves the orphanage from a fire and becomes the town heroine. Pippi decides that the orphanage is not for her and is allowed to return back to Villa Villekulla and befriend Tommy and Annika once more. She is reunited with her father on Christmas Day and he offers her the chance to become a cannibal princess, since he was washed ashore of an uncharted island where he was crowned king. At the last minute Pippi decides to stay because she cannot leave Tommy and Annika.
