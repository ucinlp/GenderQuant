{{Plot|dateAlternate ending Becky Sharp arrives at her brother-in-law's house . As Becky nears the house a servant questions her and tells her that the funeral of Sir Pitt Crawley is being held there. While talking to the servant, Becky spots a young man and asks the servant who it is. He replies: the new baronet, Sir Rawdon Crawley , Becky's son. Sir Rawdon notices her and asks if there is any way he may help. Thinking that he doesn't know who she is, Becky replies that she isn't sure he would want to help her if he knew who she was. Rawdon reveals that he knows who she is, and when Becky tries to reach out for her son, he steps back. Becky then tries to convince him that she still loves him, even though she abandoned him. Lady Jane appears, in mourning, and Rawdon exclaims that "she is here to claim me as her own." Lady Jane replies that he is. Rawdon says that it is too late for her to play the mother now, before he turns and leaves. Lady Jane explains to Becky what has happened and leads her to her late husband's grave, where she makes a speech about "love is vanity's conqueror." During the speech, Becky's son stands behind her and takes her hand in his. The scene ends with Becky repeating Lady Jane's words.
