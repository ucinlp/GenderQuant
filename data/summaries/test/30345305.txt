Danielle , a psychology student, rents a Victorian house but the house is haunted by the spirit of a long-dead child killer, who takes control of her. Influenced by the spirit, Danielle rebuilds a chair with straps that will tighten around someone until they die. The child killer originally built the device and left parts of it around the house. Danielle first straps her sister Anna  in, but she escapes when Danielle goes out to speak to a local boy, Jacob. Anna goes back to find the body of the child killer. She then meets a man claiming to be centuries old. The man helps Anna find the child killer's body. The elderly man instructs Anna to cap him after he summons the child killer into his own body. The old man instructs Anna to kill him, the host body, and the original body of the killer. The old states "Shoot me no matter what I say". Upon summoning the spirit the man immediately tells her not to shoot him. After a brief struggle Anna smashes the man with a shovel. Anna then returns to save Jacob from Danielle's chair. After freeing Jacob Danielle informs Anna that she can still "feel" the child killer. The killer, having transposed his spirit into Jacob, delivers a triple combo via crowbar to Anna's face. The next scene is Jacob turning on the gas stove in the kitchen.
