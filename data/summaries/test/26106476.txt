Chloe Severin, a student of archaeology in the first semester, is participating in an excavation under the direction of Professor Vernet. According to legend, the heavily wooded location, Brocéliande, is the burial sight of King Arthur and the wizard Merlin. Soon after their arrival, a series of mysterious murders begins to thin the ranks of the participants, all victims brandishing wounds from Druids sickles. Upon pursuing the mystery and the excavation, Chloe encounters a very lively pagan cult and its horned priest.Brocéliande - Film de Doug Headline avec Cédric Chevalme
