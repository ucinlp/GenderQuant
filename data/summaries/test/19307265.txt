Yosemite Sam and his black-haired twin are starving in a snowbound cabin. In a scene reminiscent of 1943's Wackiki Wabbit, the two hungry men start to hallucinate and see each other as food due to extreme starvation. Daffy Duck turns up as a door-to-door salesman. Upon realizing he is a duck, the two Sams chase Daffy all over the cabin, to try to turn him into a duck dinner. Eventually Daffy is able to explain that he is selling cookbooks, and happens to have a complimentary turkey dinner in his sample case. He lays out the spread and makes a quick exit as the famished Sams sit down to eat. Before the two Sams can take a bite, a hoard of hungry mice dash from out of the woodwork and strip the turkey clean in a few seconds. At the point of despair, they hear another knock on the door. Daffy is there again, offering some after-dinner mints. The two Sams grab him and pull him inside. Daffy is able to stick his head out the door for a moment and tell the audience, "Well, here we go again!" He then gets yanked back inside and the door closes to a black-out that ends the cartoon.
