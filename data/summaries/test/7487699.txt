It's Hallowe'en, and Jack Frost  covers the fields with frost. A chilly scarecrow plucks a wind-blown piece of paper out of the air; it's an invitation to Betty's Hallowe'en party . Betty is mass-producing jack o'lanterns with the help of her animal friends. The partygoers arrive, and join with Betty in song. Meanwhile, a hulking gorilla gatecrashes the party, and threatens to ruin the evening. Betty and friends turn the table on the beast, and scare him out the party.
