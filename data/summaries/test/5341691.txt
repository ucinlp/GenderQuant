Gouichi Takata  is an aged Japanese father who has not been in good terms with his son Kenichi  ever since his wife died many years ago. When he learns that his son has been hospitalised, Gouichi travels to Tokyo but Kenichi, still angry that his father left him for a remote fishing town in Japan's northern Akita province to escape the reality of his mother's death, refuses to see Gouichi. Kenichi's wife Rie  then gives her father-in-law a video tape made by Kenichi so that Gouichi may learn more about his son. The tape contains a footage of Li Jiamin, a Nuo opera artiste from a village in Yunnan province of China. In the recording, Li promised Kenichi to perform Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles for him if he returns the next year. Gouichi then decides to go to China in his sick son's place to film Li's performance. Gouichi arrives in Li Village , near the city of Lijiang, only to learn that Li has been imprisoned for assaulting someone who insulted his illegitimate son. His translator Jiang Wen  and the local guide Qiu Lin  suggest that he films someone else, but Gouichi insists on Li. After much trouble attaining clearances from the authorities, Gouichi gains entry to the prison facility. However, Li breaks down in tears on stage and is unable to perform as he misses his son badly. Gouichi decides to travel to Stone Village  to fetch Li's eight-year-old son, Yang Yang . While in the village, Gouichi receives a call from Rie, who tells him that Kenichi has been touched by his efforts in China and requests he comes home. Gouchi wonders if the message ultimately comes from Rie or Kenichi but continues with his plan to unite Li and Yang Yang. On the way back from Stone Village, the vehicle breaks down. Yang Yang takes the chance to run away as he does not want to meet a father he has never seen. As Gouichi chases after the boy, both become lost in the limestone hills. They have no choice but to spend the night in a cave awaiting rescue. Yang Yang, initially hostile towards Gouichi, gradually warms up to him. The next morning, they are found by a combined effort of villagers and the police. Gouichi feels that Yang Yang's opinion should be respected and decides not to force him to meet with his father. At this time, Gouichi receives another call from Rie, who informs him that Kenichi has died, leaving behind a letter announcing the long-awaited forgiveness. Gouichi returns to the prison with many photographs of Yang Yang. The much moved Li promises to put up his best performance. Supported by a band of musicians and co-performers, all inmates of the prison as well, Li performs Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles. With his own solo journey in a foreign country to seek forgiveness from his son finally concluded, Gouichi returns to his fishing town.
