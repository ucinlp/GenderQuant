{{Plot|dateThe breakoutThe manhuntThe aftermath One after another, the fugitives are found. Most are shot, but many of the prisoners freeze or starve to death in the harsh winter. Spring is coming, and the hasenjagd is nearly forgotten. Michail and Nikolai even work at the farm. Then the war ends. Nobody cares that Berghammer has discovered in the end that the two Russians were hiding at the Karnerâ€™s place. They are much more concerned about destroying incriminating files and uniforms. Lehmberger is found hanging in his store. It is explained in the closing credits that just nine of the 500 Russian soldiers are known to have survived . Michail and Nikolai go home. Today, they live in the former Soviet Union. After the credits, a final scene shows a courtroom. The judge renders judgment upon the mayor of the village in which the Hasenjagd has taken place. He has been indicted for inciting the villagers to hunt the prisoners down. Due to many conflicting testimonies, the mayor is acquitted, though the court remains unconvinced of his innocence.
