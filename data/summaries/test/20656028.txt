A bittersweet love story that takes place in the vision of their futures of two children, one American and one Soviet. The Soviet dreams of coming here, while the American dreams of dancing with the Bolshoi Ballet. As both try to pursue their goals, symbolically both countries still have a long way to go. The film is not political. The focus is on the cultures and people of our two dynamic countries.
