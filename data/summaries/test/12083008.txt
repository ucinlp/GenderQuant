 Set in the wake of the long Chadian civil war, 16-year-old Atim  is sent by his grandfather to the city to kill Nassara , the man who murdered his father before Atim's birth. Atim, carrying his father's gun, finds Nassara running a bakery. Unexpectedly, the taciturn Nassara takes Atim under his wing as the son he never had and begins teaching him how to run the bakery. The emotionally conflicted Atim is drawn into the life of Nassara and his pregnant wife , before a finale that Variety described as "sharp, fast and unexpected."Dry Season by Deborah Young, Variety, September 1, 2006
