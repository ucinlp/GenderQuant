Tony Benson is a psychopathic, deeply confused, socially inept man. He lives alone in a flat on a London council estate tower block. He obsessively collects 1980s violent action movies, and he aimlessly wanders the streets of London looking to connect with anybody, his life is dull, empty, odd, and is made up of deeply bad habits. He has been unemployed and living on state benefits for 20 years. Early on in the film he is revealed to be a secret serial killer. He kills men he encounters by chance, including two drug addicts whom he uncomfortably tries to engage with after inviting them to his home to smoke heroin. The encounter ends with Tony suffocating one of them with a plastic bag while locking the other in a cupboard before letting him go believing the terrified addict wouldn't go to the police. The rare visitors Tony does get usually complain of the rotting smell from his house which he blames on clogged drains, when in truth its the decaying bodies of Tonys victims. Others he meets at gay bars before bringing them back to his flat and usually end with him rejecting their advances and killing them too. He also gets dismissed after visiting a prostitute with only Â£5, asking the price of a cuddle and striking up a warped conversation with her. Tony is shown to be very confused about his sexuality. In other scenes he is seen disposing of the bodies of his victims by butchering their torsos and human organs in his kitchen sink before bagging them and dumping them in the River Thames and canals in London. In other scenes of dark comedy he is seen sharing a bed with a rotting corpse obviously one of his victims from another murder, and dragging bodies which are stashed around the house out to put on the couch to sit and watch TV with him. Tony also comes under fire from a vicious lager lout  when his son goes missing. Grover bullies Tony whenever they cross paths, he attacks Tony with volleys of verbal and physical abuse, including spitting on him in the street during the search of his son and coming across Tony. Grover accuses Tony of being a paedophile and wrongly blames him for his son's disappearance. Tony becomes suspect number one because of his oddball appearance and his withdrawn nature towards other people. Tony's dark past could finally be revealed when a police detective pays him a visit to question him on the missing boy's whereabouts, only time tells if Tony is responsible and if his murdering ways will be sussed. Tony is a disturbing, sparse film. Some of the scenes are very mundane as in real life which makes it a realistic portrayal of something the underbelly of London could throw up.
