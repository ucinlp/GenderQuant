Mr. Watkins narrates throughout the cartoon. Dorlock Holmes live on Beeker St. in London. Inside of their apartment, Holmes is busily engaged in "deduction" â€” tax deduction, that is, hoping to write off such costs as "taxi fares, to and from murders". Following a knock on the door, a mailman falls into their flat. While Holmes attributes it to curare, a type of poison, the mailman chides him for not fixing the step. The letter identifies that there is a criminal on the loose named The Shropshire Slasher. Holmes and Watkins go to a pub where the Slasher is known to hang out. Holmes' attempts to gather clues land darts in his bill. When the Shropshire Slasher is finally revealed, Holmes repeatedly tries to deal with the man and cajoles and threatens him, but he proves much stronger and always injures Holmes; meanwhile, Watkins speaks reasonably to the suspect and he not only willing divulges his identity but is peacefully persuaded to turn himself in to the police. Just then, a woman arrives selling flowers. Holmes accuses her of selling them without a license and threatens to arrest her. The Shropshire Slasher moans "Mother!" Before Holmes has time to consider what has happened, the Shropshire Slasher grabs him by the neck and starts shaking him violently, causing all of Holmes' possessions to fall out of his pockets. The Shropshire Slasher and his mother then leave. Watkins asks a beat-up looking Holmes what school he learned to be a detective. Holmes answers: "Elementary, my dear Watkins. Elementary".
