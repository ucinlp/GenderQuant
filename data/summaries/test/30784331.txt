In 1993, after Pablo Escobar is gunned down by the police, his then sixteen-year-old son Juan Pablo flees to Argentina together with his mother and sister. To avoid being identified and in fear of his life he changes his name to Sebastián Marroquín. "My life was worth $4 million ... That’s the price they put on my head", he said. After a decade of silence, he and his mother publicly speak about the life of their family member for the first time. In an attempt to end the cycle of violence and to ask for forgiveness Marroquín travels to Colombia to meet the sons of two of his father's two most prominent murder victims: presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galán and Minister of Justice Rodrigo Lara Bonilla as well as the son of the former Colombian president César Gaviria. In connection to telling the story of Pablo Escobar, the film also explores the recent violent history of Colombia as a "narco-state" and the country's illegal drug trade.
