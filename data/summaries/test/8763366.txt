Brilliant surgeon Daniel Jekyll  dedicates himself to medical research, hoping to unlock man's animal nature and increase his capacity for self-healing. Jekyll accidentally creates a white powder which, when inhaled through the nose, temporarily turns him into a completely uninhibited sex maniac who calls himself Mister Hyde. Jekyll can't bring himself to throw away the drug or to stop taking it, and Hyde's escapades play havoc with Jekyll's life. At the very end, we see Robert Louis Stevenson literally spinning in his grave.
