It's SpongeBob's laundry day, and SpongeBob is drying a whole load of his signature "square pants". But while his pants are in the dryer, SpongeBob gets a call from Patrick who wants to show him how long he can make a funny whistling sound. Patrick does this for several hours, and when he finally stops, SpongeBob goes to check on his pants which apparently all shrunk in the dryer . Upon hearing that there will not be another shipping of "square pants" for months, SpongeBob tries out several different styles of pants at the mall. He finally chooses a pair of "round pants". When he sees Patrick, the dim-witted starfish fails to recognize SpongeBob without his square pants. He later meets Sandy, who although knows it's SpongeBob, makes a comment on his new look, which SpongeBob takes literally as if she really does not recognize him when she calls him "SpongeBob FancyPants". He then goes to see Squidward, who sarcastically pretends he does not know SpongeBob in order to get him to walk away. Feeling discouraged by the idea that nobody knows who he is, SpongeBob decides to start a new life as "SpongeBob RoundPants", to which he decides to re-apply to his job at the Krusty Krab. When he meets Squidward at the restaurant, SpongeBob acts as if this is his first time applying at the Krusty Krab and has never met Squidward before. Squidward decides to take advantage of this by training SpongeBob to act like him , in hopes that SpongeBob will later get fired. After a series of complaints from customers, Mr. Krabs confronts SpongeBob for his lousy work, to which SpongeBob explains that since he has new pants, he is no longer "SpongeBob SquarePants". Mr. Krabs then convinces SpongeBob that he should take the pants off. SpongeBob, no longer wearing pants, then continues to be himself and go back to being a good employee. However, when Sandy comes in seeing SpongeBob in his underwear, SpongeBob freaks out again after Sandy calls him "SpongeBob UnderPants".
