Raghavan Master , a scion of a high Adiga Brahmin family and an ardent communist, is now in crisis as his Tharavadu is devoid of the fame and fortune it once had. Balachandran Adiga is his only son, who has the burden of looking after his family and his four nubile daughters. He is aware of the difficulties involved in bringing the family back from the brink of nothingness and in marrying off his sisters. Balachandran's eldest sister Shobha does some tailoring and manges a low earning with which the family is kept out of hunger. Balachandran is engaged to Sumithra, his cousin and childhood pal, but in the turn of events, one Thripran Namboodhiri  comes with an offer to marry his niece to Balachandran, thereby agreeing to make him a secretariat staff and thereby save their sinking family. Sumithra forces Balchandran to risk their dreams for the sake of his family. He is forced to forget his murappennu and childhood playmate Sumitra and is compelled to marry Surabhi, a girl from a rich family, to tackle the serious economic adversities that his family faces. Notwithstanding the family chaos, Balachandran's younger sister Shubha walks out with Adivasi leader Sreedharan on the day of Balachandranâ€™s marriage, causing irreparable damage to the family reputation, following which his mother dies. Sumithra finally marries a cruel and corrupt police officer who is always doubtful on the character of his wife. At this juncture, Balachandran joins the job at the Secretariat. He lives with seventy-year-old Unnithan Asan who acts as his guide all through the corruption-filled secretariate. His financial needs also force him to become another corrupt officer who is always in the lookout for money and power. He deliberately pretends himself to be a bachelor, which gives space for Vimala, a divorcee, to make a try in his life. He has sex with her and manages the situation well, and with the help of Vimala who happens to be the relative of revenue minister Pattam Raveendran, climbs the ladder of bureaucracy in a rather speedy way. What follows next is a series of events that turns Balachandran's mind so as to tear off his new life and go back to his native to lead a simple, peaceful life with his wife and family.
