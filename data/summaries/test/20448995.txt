The first of three stories told in Mid-Afternoon Barks, "The Village and the Stranger", follows a herdsman  who has abandoned his flock for a village in the Beijing municipality. Taking residence with his roommate , he is asked by his landlord  to install an electric metal pole in the courtyard outside their apartment. It becomes increasingly difficult to determine, however, whether the request was part of a dream or not, or indeed if the herdsman is even in Beijing. In the second tale, entitled "City, Wood, Repairman", three workmen  in the city are installing poles but to no apparent purpose. A seemingly unrelated but parallel story between a repairman  and a young man (the film's composer [[Xiao He  rounds out this part of the film. In the final tale, "Watermelon and Farmer", a farmer , is constantly bothered by rude customers, children, and workmen, who make him move his cart in order to attach electrical wires to the film's ubiquitous poles.
