Eric Idle and Robert Wuhl star as a mismatched couple, Wendel and Lou in this mystery-comedy caper. Characters include a one-handed kingpin,a lawyer who suffers from dwarfism, and twin brothers, one a crazed photographer and the other a mild-mannered antique dealer. One of Wendel's many former foster parents, Mr Hu, dies, and his lawyer  gives Wendel his inheritance. A riddle. Wendel and Lou  soon realise the riddle isn't Hu's heirloom, just the key to finding Wendel's inheritance. But they are pursued by several unfavourable characters, almost all of whom want them dead.
