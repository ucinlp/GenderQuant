Casim Khan  is a Glaswegian DJ of Pakistani origin. His devout Muslim parents, Tariq and Sadia, have arranged for him to marry his first cousin, Jasmine, and Casim is more or less happy with the arrangement. Casim then meets and falls in love with Roisin , an Irish Catholic working as a part-time music teacher at his sister's Catholic school. Roisin books a short holiday break for them both on seeing an advert in a travel agent's shop window, and while on holiday Casim tells her about the arranged marriage his family are planning for him. They then have to decide whether their love is strong enough to endure without the support of their respective communities. At the same time, Casim's younger sister, Tahara, struggles to find herself between the bullying of some Scottish schoolmates and her Pakistani relatives. Rukhsana, Casim's older sister, loses her fianc√© because Casim's new relationship brings dishonour to the family. Roisin loses her job because the Catholic school's direction does not accept her relationship since she is a married &ndash; though separated &ndash; woman and because she and Casim are living together. Roisin is finally moved by her hierarchy to a non-denominational school, Casim confronts his family, begging them to respect his choice before returning to her, while Tahara leaves to study journalism at the University of Edinburgh against her parents' will.
