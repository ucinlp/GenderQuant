Todd and Terry are twins. They are blonde, cute, bright and identical in every respect, with one exception. One of them is a murderer. This starts one night at a drive-in theater when a teenager was slaughtered in the back seat of his car while his girlfriend watched. Todd is found guilty for the heinous crime and is locked away in an asylum. Years passed and Terry lives happily with his mother , who smothers him with enough love for two sons. All is fine until one Thanksgiving when they receive news that Todd escaped. Terry goes on a killing spree to ensure that Todd goes back to the asylum. His first kill is his mother's fiancée, when he chops off his arm with a machete, before stabbing him to death. Meanwhile, Dr. Berman and her assistant, Jackie, go out in search for Todd. Jackie meets a sticky end, when he is stabbed by Terry. Dr. Berman also suffers the same fate. Whilst in the woods looking for Todd, she comes across Terry, who cuts her in half with the machete, leaving her to die. After the killings, Terry changes from his bloody T-shirt in to a vest. He then proceeds to the place where his new neighbour, Andrea, is babysitting a young newborn baby. They then begin a mini relationship, until the parents come home. Whilst that was happening, a friend of Terry's, Karen , bumps into Todd thinking he is Terry. So when Todd announces himself to her, she panics and runs away, telling her friends. Karen later tells Terry about seeing his brother. He then disappears into the night in search for him, whilst Karen, Gregg, Brad go back to Andrea's house for a party. Terry tells Maddie that Todd has escaped. She starts to panic. Meanwhile Todd comes across Dr. Berman's split body and breakdown over it, trying to move the body back together. Back at the young born baby's house, the parents are looking forward to a night together - until Terry knocks on the door. The father answers the doors and is decapitated. The mother goes to check where the father is and discovers his head hanging from a rope. Suddenly, Terry jumps out of nowhere and kills her. Later on, Andrea and Gregg leave the party to play tennis. They are unaware that Terry is watching them. They both leave soon after and have sex on the diving board by the swimming pool. Terry surprises them and kills them. He later meets up with Brad and Karen. Brad goes off to find the now dead Gregg and Andrea. When getting in the car, he meets Todd, who asks him to help him get Terry as he is killing people. Brad doesn't believe him, that is until Todd holds a gun up at his head. Karen and Terry meanwhile are have a sexual moment together. Brad knocks at the door and Terry answers it and sees Todd holding a gun at him. Todd later disappears. Brad and Terry go running off to find Todd, but Brad meets his maker when Terry stabs him in the neck with a carving fork. Karen finds Terry and discovers his secret, when he attempts to kill her. He chases her all over the place, and in the process, she discovers Brad's body. She runs to the young baby's house and discovers the mother's corpse. She takes the baby and runs for her live when Terry enters the house. Whilst all that is happening, Maddie finally discovers Terry's secret when she finds his bloodied T-shirt in the bin. She goes in search of her fiancée, only to discover him dead. The final showdown between brothers comes at the swimming pool and they both battle for survival. They both tumble into the water, Todd becomes weak and almost drowns. Maddie then appears and shoots Terry - killing him. Maddie and Todd embrace.
