The film is based on manuscripts of the interrogations of Adolf Eichmann  before he was tried and hanged in a prison in Israel. Eichmann recounts events from his past to a young Israeli officer, Captain Avner Less , who is faced with the immense task of tricking the skilled manipulator into self-incrimination. While the world waits, Less' countrymen call for immediate execution, forcing him and Eichmann to confront each other in a battle of wills.
