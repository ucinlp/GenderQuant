Now in her late thirties, she finally decides to have a child of her own but her plans are dampened when she discovers she has a minuscule chance of becoming pregnant due to her uterus being T-shaped. Also denied the chance to adopt, Kate hires an immature, obnoxious South Philly woman named Angie Ostrowiski  to become a surrogate mother for her. When Angie becomes pregnant, Kate begins preparing for motherhood in her own typically driven fashion â€” until her surrogate shows up at her door with no place to live. Their conflicting personalities put them at odds as Kate learns first-hand about balancing motherhood and career and also dates the owner of a local blended juice cafe, Rob . Unknown to Kate, the in-vitro fertilization procedure Angie had did not succeed and she is feigning the pregnancy. Hoping to ultimately run off with her payment, Angie begins to regret lying about her not being pregnant but continually puts off confessing. When she gets an ultrasound, she discovers she is actually pregnant. Realizing the baby is her own (with her common-law husband, Carl , Angie is forced to confess at Kate's baby shower. When Kate explains to Angie that the pregnancy test was supposed to be taken two weeks after the procedure, and that the baby could still belong to her, it drives a wedge between the two women. At a court hearing to determine the maternity of the child, the baby turns out to be Angie's and Angie makes an impassioned apology to Kate. As the two women meet face to face after the proceedings, Angie's water breaks and Kate rushes her to the hospital. During Angie's delivery, Kate passes out. As she wakes up, the doctor supervising Angie's pregnancy tells Kate that she's two months pregnant . After receiving the news, she goes to visit Angie, who is holding her new baby girl Stefani, named for Gwen Stefani, aka "Stef". Kate forgives Angie and the two become best friends, ultimately changing each other for the better. Angie and Kate raise their children and are in a sister-like relationship one year later at Stefani's first birthday party. It is revealed that Kate and Rob are very proud parents of a baby girl and are engaged. Although he does not get back together with Angie, Carl stays close to his daughter and begins taking parenting classes.
