The film is an inside look at the world of co-ed Roller Derby, then a popular league sport. The story focuses on K.C. Carr  who has just left her former team in Kansas City, Missouri to start her life as a single mother over again in Portland, Oregon with a team called the Portland Loggers. Loggers' owner Burt Henry  is clearly interested in her, and K.C. and Burt date. But Burt has a rather ruthless side to him: he trades away K.C.'s best friend on the team, and when he sees that star male skater "Horrible" Hank Hopkins is interested in her, he manipulates the audience into booing Hopkins, causing him to go crazy and lose his job. Henry's endgame is to set up a match race between K.C. and her teammate and rival Jackie Burdette , with K.C. deliberately losing so that she can join Henry at a new team he's setting up in Chicago. But K.C. doesn't trust Henry anymore  and wins the match race.
