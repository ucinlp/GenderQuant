In early 19th century Styria, a beautiful blonde  in a diaphanous gown materialises from a misty graveyard. Encountering the Baron Hartog , a vampire hunter out to avenge the death of his sister, the girl is revealed as a vampire when her breast is seared by his crucifix. Baring her fangs to attack the Baron, she is swiftly decapitated. Many years later, a sultry dark-haired lady leaves her daughter Marcilla  in the care of General von Spielsdorf  and his family at their Styrian mansion. Marcilla quickly befriends the General's daughter, Laura . Laura suffers nightmares that she is being attacked, and her health deteriorates until she dies. Marcilla vanishes from the General's home. Faking a carriage break-down, Marcilla's mother leaves her  at the residence of a Mr Morton. Here, Carmilla befriends and seduces Morton's daughter Emma  but her need to feed overcomes her emotional attachment and Emma too begins to fade. Emma has nightmares of being pierced over the heart, and her breast shows tiny wounds. Emma's governess, Mme. Perrodot  also falls victim to Carmilla's erotic blandishments and becomes her willing tool. Some in the household, the butler and a doctor, suspect what might be happening, especially in the wake of several local girls suddenly dying, but Carmilla kills each one. All the while, a mysterious man in black  watches events from a distance, smiling . After Carmilla kills the butler, having convinced him that Mme. Perrodot is a vampire then persuaded him  to remove the garlic protecting Emma, Carmilla goes to Emma's bedroom. She says she must go away, but is taking Emma with her. A desperate and sick Madame begs Carmilla to take her with her. Carmilla kills her, in front of a horrified Emma. Emma is barely rescued by a young man named Carl  who fashions a makeshift cross from his dagger. Carmilla flees to her nearby ancestral castle, now a ruin. All this coincides with the arrival of the General, who brings with him a now-aged Baron Hartog. They find Carmilla's grave, where she sleeps. Her eyes open, and interestingly enough she makes no move to defend herself. The General lifts a stake—and back in her bedchamber Emma screams "No!"—then drives it into Carmilla's heart. He then cuts off her head. Carmilla's portrait on the wall decays, showing now a fanged skeleton instead of a beautiful young woman.
