Paris Pitman has pulled off a $500,000 robbery and is the only one who knows where the money is hidden. In a bordello, he is captured by Sheriff Woodward Lopeman, tried, convicted and sentenced to an Arizona penitentiary. A corrupt warden, LeGoff, is willing to cut the prisoner a deal. He will let Pitman break out of jail for an even split of the half-million dollars. Pitman agrees, but the plan goes awry when LeGoff is murdered by a Chinese convict, Ah-Ping. Lopeman becomes the new warden. Although they are enemies, he and Pitman work together to improve conditions at the prison. On a day the governor visits, Pitman makes his move. He manages to escape, but not before three inmates are killed, whereupon Pitman himself does away with two more, Ah-Ping being one of them. The money has been buried near a nest of rattlesnakes. Pitman heads for it, with Lopeman in hot pursuit. The money is his again when Pitman is suddenly bitten by a snake. He is left there to die while Lopeman, rather than ride back with the money, keeps it for himself and rides off into the sunset.
