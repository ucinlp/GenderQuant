The short starts out with a title card that says "Inbred Jed's Homemade Cartoons," with the character of Inbred Jed staring at the camera giving a somewhat evil hillbilly cackle. Beavis and Butt-head are then shown switching channels on their TV, watching various TV commercials and laughing at a Suzanne Somers Thighmaster commercial. While messing around in a field, Beavis and Butt-head spot a frog and proceed to play baseball with it. When they kill the frog, they see a poodle and charge after it with a baseball bat. The credits roll as you hear the duo hit the poodle with a bat and the poodle yelping in pain . The screen then reads "To be continued...", the credits roll, and a disclaimer reads that no animals were harmed in the making of this film, except for Beavis.
