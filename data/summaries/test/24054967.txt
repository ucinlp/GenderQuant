Born with Kavasam and Kundalam , and bequeathed as a gift from the Sun God to an unwed Kunti , Karnan is abandoned so as to prevent embarrassment for her. He is set afloat in the Ganga, rescued and adopted by a charioteer, who is employed with Dhritarashtra, the blind king. Years later, the now-grown up Karnan  realizes that the charioteer is his foster father only, therefore heartbroken. He does not want to become a charioteer like his foster father, and chooses to become a warrior instead. He masters archery and challenges the Pandava prince Arjuna  at a contest. When Karnan is insulted on account of his birth, the Kaurava prince Duryodhana  defends him and accepts him as his partner. Karnan is eventually crowned the king of Anga. Shortly after, a young orphan Meghanathan , who was accused of setting a school on fire, runs to Karnan seeking justice. The latter, knowing he is equally an orphan, willingly supports Meghanathan. At one time, Lord Indra, the rain god and king of heavens, disguised as an old Brahmin, goes to Karnan and asks for his Kavasam and Kundalam in daanam . Indra was apprehensive that Karnan, by virtue of his phenomenal skills as a warrior, may be able to overwhelm Arjun. He therefore asked for this gift so as to reduce his strength. Karnan had been cautioned by the Sun God that Lord Indra was going to make some such move. But Karna is so large hearted that he cannot refuse anyone. Knowing fully well, that Indra was playing a trick on him disguised as a Brahmin, he yet parts with his Kavasam and Kundalam, which were parts of his body since birth and which made him invincible. Lord Indra is taken aback at Karnan's capacity to give away anything asked for. He tells that what Karnan has done today, no ordinary mortal could have done. Immensely pleased with Karnan's generosity, Indra lets him ask for any varam . Karnan asks Indra to kindly give him the weapon Shakti which has the potential to destroy any enemy. Lord Indra gives Shakti to Karnan with the proviso however that he could use it only once and that thereafter the weapon shall return to Lord Indra. Karnan is keen to acquire the Brahmastra Mantra from the great teacher Parasurama. However, he knows that Parasurama gives instructions to Brahmins  only. So he disguises as a Brahmin and beseeches Parasurama to accept him as a sishya . Parsurama accepts him as such and starts giving him instructions. One day when Parasurama is resting in Karnan's lap, it so happens that a giant bee stings Karnan on the lower portion of his thigh. It was very painful and he starts bleeding. However, fearing that if he moved his legs, he would awaken Parasurama, he does not move at all and continues to suffer. When Parasurama wakes up, he sees Karnan bleeding, He asks Karnan about his true identity, and states that a Brahmin cannot suffer so much physical pain. Only a kshattriya  can endure so much discomfort. Karnan is obliged to disclose his identity. Parasurama is greatly enraged, because he is a sworn enemy of kshattriyas. He therefore curses Karnan that as he had learnt through deceit, he shall forget the vidya  which Parasuram had taught him at the crucial juncture. Meanwhile, Karnan saves Subhangi  from an out-of-control chariot, and they fall for each other. However, Subhangi's parents disapprove of this because they don't want their daughter to marry someone who doesn't know about his own parents. But after some time they accept, so Karnan and Subhangi are happily married. She gives birth to a son Vrishasena. Shortly before the Kurukshetra war, Lord Krishna , a supporter of the Pandavas, finds out about Karnan's true background. He tells Kunti that Karnan is her first born son who she abandoned, she realizes it soon, and so does Karnan. He reconciles with his mother. Kunti gets two wishes from Karnan, one that he will not attack the other four sons of Kunti other than Arjuna, and he will attack Arjuna with the Nagastra only once. However, Krishna goes against Karnan after this. Parasurama's curse was to prove Karnan's undoing. At the Kurukshetra war, while having a sword fight with an enemy soldier, Karnan's son Vrishasena gets killed by Arjuna's arrow upon Krishna's commands. This results in Subhangi and Karnan's dismay, making Karnan more determined to kill Arjuna. The next day during war, Karnan uses the Nagastra to kill Arjuna, but Krishna saves Arjuna by preventing the arrow from hurting him. Since he cannot use the Nagastra more than once, he is unable to kill Arjuna. A wheel of his chariot gets stuck in a big hole, and he gets down to take it out. At that time, Arjuna shoots many arrows at the helpless Karnan, severely wounding him, but is curiously unable to kill him. Krishna tells him that the great Dharma of noble charity that Karnan had performed during his lifetime was protecting him. Krishna disguises as a Brahmin, goes to Karnan and asks him his virtues as donation. Karnan who cannot say no to anyone gives his virtues to the brahmin, then dies after Arjuna shoots a few more arrows at him. The other Pandavas, who realize that Karnan was their eldest brother, arrive and are saddened by his death, so is Kunti. Arjuna, struck by guilt, curses himself for killing Karnan. But Krishna reminds him that before the final battle, the curses that inflicted Karnan  were also responsible for his death, and that there was no need for Arjuna to blame just himself. The film however ends on a positive note, as Karnan is blessed when entering heaven.
