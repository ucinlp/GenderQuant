Muhammad Arief , the son of poor family in Sumenep, Madura Island, greatly enjoys science, especially physics. His father, Muslat , is a former salt farmer who became a driver after an economic downturn. His mother, Salmah , has gone abroad in search of work; the family have not heard from her, and Arief misses her. Although it is difficult due to his economic situation, Arief studies physics diligently. Arief's physics teacher Tari Hayat , seeing potential in him after Arief retrieves a ball from a tree with a rocket, suggests that he participate in the International Physics Olympiad in Singapore. Arief agrees, but his main goal is to find his mother. After the selection process in Jakarta, Arief goes to the Olympiad with fellow would-be-physicists Muhammad Thamrin  and Clara Annabela . After arriving in Singapore, the Indonesian team wins several matches. However, just before the finals Arief discovers that his mother is to leave for Malaysia. Although at first he decides to rush to the port to stop her, he is convinced to stay with the Olympiad team, who win the competition. Arief then stops his mother from going to Malaysia, and the two return to Madura.
