Small town, the American dream. A blue-collar family living the idyllic rural lifestyle. Nothing is out of place except for the lack of white picket fences and the old jail that occupies the second floor of their century old home. Seth Delray  knew the possibilities before he moved his wife and two kids into the old jailhouse, but the Sheriff assured him that it would be an act of God to put that place back in to service. Times are tight, and it was just too good of a deal to refuse. That is, until the county jail caught fire. The Sheriff hands were tied and he had to put the displaced inmates anywhere he could find iron bars with a locking door. The Delray's were his only option. For Seth the worst wasn't the locked up criminals above his living room, it was the mortal fear in his children's eyes, the piercing cold looks from his wife. The deep, dark creeping recognition that something had happened there, something terrible, something that would rip his soul with a hundred year old hands.
