Six young people wake up in an abandoned building, with no idea of what is going on or how they got there. A mysterious figure appears to them over a PA system, telling them that they are on a gameshow called "Are You Scared?", and that they will have to face their deepest fears in order to win the contest. However, their challenges are real, and deadly, and one by one the group must face their worst fears, facing the highest stakes imaginable. The film involves several 'contests', all resulting in the death of the participant. Death by acid, by explosion, by shotgun, by hungry rats, by strangulation, power drill and decapitation by axe all feature.
