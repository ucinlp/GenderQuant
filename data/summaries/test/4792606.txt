Set in Auckland, New Zealand the film centres around four Samoan boys: ladies' man Michael, party boy Sefa, good boy Albert, and weird Stanley, who although they are in their mid 20s to early 30s have a reputation for behaving immaturely at special occasions such as family weddings. After four particular incidents , the local minister of their Samoan church rules that the four are to be banned from the wedding of Michael's brother, Sione. This is hard news for the boys, especially since Michael was supposed to be the best man, however Albert comes up with a solution - bring a date to the wedding. He proposes to the minister that being with a girl at the wedding would force the men to be on their best behaviour. The minister allows them to go but requires that the boys must have a serious relationship with their dates or Eugene  will forcibly block them. While the boys think it's an easy plan, they soon realise that finding a girlfriend isn't as easy as it looks, especially since the wedding is just one month away.
