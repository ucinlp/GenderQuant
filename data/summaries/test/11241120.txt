Broadway stars Gwen Marlow  and Ernest Lane  are appearing in a 6-year run of Victor Herbert's operetta Sweethearts . They are also very much in love after six years of marriage. Norman Trumpett  is a successful Hollywood talent scout under pressure to recruit Marlow and Lane for his studio, which their Broadway producer Felix Lehman  is equally determined to prevent. The couple's attempts to rest and be together are repeatedly thwarted by professional and personal demands made on their time, talents and money by Lehman and their own theatrical families - who also live with them. Frustrated beyond endurance and seduced by Trumpett's idyllic  description of working conditions in Hollywood, they decide to quit the show and take the Hollywood offer.  This spells “the end” for the Broadway production, news so devastating that constantly feuding playwright Leo Kronk  and composer Oscar Engel  stop fighting long enough for Lehman, Kronk and company to hatch a counter-plot. By convincing Marlow that Lane is having an affair with his pretty secretary Kay Jordan  they split-up the happy couple, putting an end to the Hollywood deal and allowing Lehman to mount two separate touring companies of the show, each with one star and one understudy. Delighted with the outcome, Engel produces Kronk's new play - which closes in a week. From a Variety review of the play Marlow and Lane realize they were tricked and join forces to confront Lehman.... but nonetheless resume the Broadway run of “Sweethearts” together.
