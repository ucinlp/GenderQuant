The film is about a projection-equipment repair mechanic named Bruno Winter  and a depressed hitchhiker Robert Lander  who has just been through a break-up with his wife and a half-hearted suicide attempt. They travel along the Western side of the East-German border in a repair truck, visiting worn-out movie theaters. The movie contains many long shots without dialogue, and it was filmed in black and white by long-time Wenders collaborator Robby MÃ¼ller.{{cite news}}
