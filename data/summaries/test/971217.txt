Having solved a high profile case involving a serial killer, Jessica Shepard  is a rising officer in the San Francisco Police Department. She is transferred to the Homicide division and promoted to the rank of Inspector. Her deceased father's former partner, John Mills , serves as her proud mentor. The recently promoted Jessica finds that she might once again have to prove herself in a department that takes no prisoners. When one of her former one night stands is murdered, she and her new partner, Mike Delmarco , are assigned to the case. Shepard, who also has a drinking problem, soon falls under suspicion. Three more murders follow, all of whom have had relationships with her. Shepard begins to experience a mental breakdown, blacking out for increasingly long periods of time. Her father, a police patrolman, had gone on a killing spree back in the 1970s and then murdered her mother. She begins to fear that she has the same violent tendencies and that she has been committing murder in her disorganized state. With only her mentor's support she must find the perpetrator and clear her name, before she becomes the murderer's next victim. Finally Shepard finds out that Mills is the killer. He killed all of her lovers, as well as her parents, because he considered it his mission to prevent her growing up to be a dissolute woman like her mother. As her father's partner, he had felt the responsibility to inform him that his wife was a nymphomaniac, which drove him insane. As he had an illicit affair with Shepard's mother, and took offense to her behavior, he felt the need to kill her and her lovers. Also ashamed that he destroyed his partner's marriage and drove him insane, he decided to put him out of his misery by killing him. During his confession, Shepard secretly transmits Mills' confession on a mobile phone, allowing her old partner to track them down. When Mills tries to shoot her partner, Shepard shoots him in the chest and he falls off the dock. The film closes on him drifting on the ocean surface surrounded by sea lions as the cops look on.
