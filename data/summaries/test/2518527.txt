Ramkishen  is a wealthy and respected industrialist. His family is a model of happiness and togetherness, rare in modern times. He has three sons-- Vivek , Prem  and Vinod -- as well as a daughter, Sangeeta . Vivek is the son of Ramkishen's dead first wife. Mamta , Ramkishen's second wife, has brought up Vivek and he is very close to her. Prem, Vinod and Sangeeta are Mamta's own children. Vivek is disabled in one arm because of a childhood accident in which he saved Prem and Vinod. The three brothers stay in a palatial house with their parents. Sangeeta is married to Anand  and has a little daughter, Radhika. The three of them stay with Anand's elder brother Anurag , sister-in-law Jyoti  and two young nephews. On Ramkishen and Mamta's twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, there is a large get-together of family members and friends. The guests include Vivek's friend Anwar , Ramkishen's friend Preetam , family friend Dharamraj  and many others. At the anniversary party, Vivek is introduced to Sadhna ([[Tabu , the daughter of another industrialist. The next day, Sadhna's father Adarsh  calls on Ramkishen and proposes marriage between his daughter and Vivek. Everyone is overjoyed at the proposal. Vivek hesitates, feeling that he might be a burden on Sadhna with his disability. However, she sticks by her decision. Vivek is touched by this and gets married to her. Preetam's daughter Dr. Preeti  and Prem have loved each other since they were children, but have never spoken of their feelings. They are unsure about each other, but their mutual love is obvious to everyone else. Their engagement is finalized after a comic scene in which Dharamraj's daughter Sapna  and Vinod pretend to be Preeti and Prem, acting as though they like each other. Later, Vivek makes the introverted Prem realize the importance of expressing his love for Preeti. From then on, Prem and Preeti start enjoying romantic moments together. Vinod and Sapna are very fun-loving and flirtatious with each other. They, too, get engaged. Ramkishen feels that he can now retire from the business and let his sons take over. He decides to appoint Vivek, the most experienced of his sons, the Managing Director  of his companies. The twist to the story comes when Anurag throws Anand, Sangeeta and Radhika out of his house without any share in the family assets. Dharamraj and three snobbish socialite friends of Mamta convince her that she must compel Ramkishen to divide the house and business equally among his sons. They convince Mamta that fights and complications will occur in future, if the three brothers live in the same house with their wives and children. They especially warn her against Vivek because he is not her biological son. This leads to a tangled web of problems and sadness. Vivek decides to go on a self-imposed exile. He moves to Rampur  with Sadhna. Vinod insists on accompanying them. Prem is appointed the MD of the companies. However, he makes it clear that he considers Vivek the real MD and himself just a deputy. Preeti and Prem also cancel their wedding, disappointing Mamta. Preeti and Sapna take care of Sadhna, who is expecting a child. Anurag faces professional and domestic problems. Realizing the importance of Anand, Sangeeta and Radhika in his life, he welcomes them back. Sangeeta talks to Mamta and describes how Vivek had helped her during this crisis. Mamta realizes her fault and goes to Rampur to bring Vivek and Sadhna home. The family is re-united. Sadhna gives birth to a child. Some time later, Prem and Preeti get married to each other, as do Vinod and Sapna. Dharamraj accepts his mistakes. Vivek takes charge as MD of Ramkishen's companies. At the end, there is a hint that Vivek's disabled hand is beginning to get healed.
