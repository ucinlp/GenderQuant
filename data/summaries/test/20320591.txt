The Odom family lives in a large, white, Southern house in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, just off Pitt Street, looking out onto Charleston Harbor. Lucille Odom  is nearing the end of her last year of high school when her mother, Helen Odom , leaves the family, breaking all ties. Lucille is left to care for her recently retired father, Warren Odom . The family then spends the summer trying to get their lives together, which is complicated when the older daughter of the family, Rae , moves back home with a new husband  and a new baby on the way, about which Rae has mixed feelings. While reminiscing about their mother Rae tells Lucille that their mother tried to abort Lucille when she was pregnant. Warren notices his daughters in a new and different way now that his wife is gone and he is no longer working. Everything changes for Lucille as she comes-of-age and learns about her family in new ways.
