The film is episodic, depicting the two detectives teaming on several different cases, with varying degrees of success. The main focus of the movie centers on them trying to bust one main criminal, an LA crime king-pin named "Rizzo" . The film is extremely cynical, strongly implying that crime does pay ... and that the biggest criminals in society are corrupt politicians and businessmen who will never be punished for their crimes. The film ends with an unusual soundtrack flash-forward. While we see Gould attempting to arrest a powerful figure who will ultimately walk free, we also hear something which hasn't happened yet: Gould's character quitting the police force and applying for a civilian job.
