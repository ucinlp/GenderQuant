The film begins with a fight between German tourist Jasmin Münchgstettner  from Rosenheim and her husband whilst they are driving across the desert. She storms out of the car and happens upon the truck stop run by the tough-as-nails and short tempered Brenda , whose own husband, after an argument out front, is soon to leave as well. Jasmin takes a room at the adjacent motel. Initially suspicious of the foreigner, Brenda eventually befriends Jasmin and allows her to work at the café. The café is visited by an assortment of colorful characters, including a strange ex-Hollywood set-painter  and a glamorous tattoo artist . The film has a melodious backdrop in the form of J. S. Bach preludes played on piano by Brenda's son . With an ability to quietly empathize with everyone she meets at the café, helped by a passion for cleaning and performing magic tricks, Jasmin gradually transforms the café and all the people in it.
