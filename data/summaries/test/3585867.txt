 Britney Allen is living a 'dream life' as cheerleading captain and girlfriend of the quarterback of Pacific Vista High. Her best friend and rival is the highly ambitious Winnie Harper. Her life changes dramatically when her father loses his job, and the family must relocate to the fictional city, Crenshaw Heights, which Britney being the "White Girl" takes quite a while to adjust to. She meets Camille, head cheerleader of the Crenshaw Heights 'Warriors' and her friends and fellow cheerleaders, Kirresha and Leti. She also meets Jesse, a male cheerleader, the only person who is nice to her on her first day. Britney, at the urging of Winnie, has already vowed to never cheer for another team , but after being dared by Camille and Jesse to show up at cheerleading tryouts, Britney impresses everyone with her cheer experience and skills and Camille, after being persuaded by her friends to "do it for the squad", reluctantly invites her into the squad. Britney and Jesse become close and eventually kiss. While in the gym, Tyson gropes Britney, and she grabs his testicles and squeezes them. She tells him she will "pluck his grapes or in your case, raisins" if he does it again. Around this time, singer Rihanna announces a TV special where all high school cheerleading squads can compete, with the winners appearing in a music video with her and winning new computers for their school. Winnie finds out that Britney is cheering with the Warriors and reveals this to her friends. A week later, Britney lies to Camille, telling her that she cannot cheer at the next game as she is holding a memorial service for her dead dog; she is actually Brad's date for Pacific Vista's Homecoming dance. Camille and Jesse arrive at Britney's to offer their condolences and when they see Britney and Brad dressed up, Camille kicks her off the squad. At the dance, Winnie reveals to everyone that she has been sleeping with Brad behind Britney's back and Britney dumps Brad on the spot, telling Winnie that she is "too much of a backstabber to have any real friends". The next day, the day of the auditions, Britney arrives at the Warrior's bus and comes to wish them good luck. When Winnie, with the rest of her team, makes fun of the Warriors, Britney stands up to Winnie and defends them. Camille, impressed by this, lets Britney cheer with them again. Jesse, however, is still mad at her for not admitting that she had a boyfriend, not even when they kissed. Both of the rivaling teams show their performances. At the auditions, the two finalists are Pacific Vista and Crenshaw Heights. PV wows the audience with their routine and Camille begins to get worried. Then Britney points out that all their steps are repetitive and that they have their secret weapon: krumping. CH, now dressed in cargos, steps on stage during PV's performance and begins mirroring their steps. Finally, they begin krumping, wiping PV off the stage and impressing Rihanna with their own demonstration. After CH's performance ends, Winnie approaches Rihanna and insists that the Crenshaw Heights squad should be disqualified  for interrupting PV's routine. This leads to an argument between Winnie and the rest of the Pacific Vista squad, during which Britney notes that the squad can choose to replace Winnie as Captain of the PV squad effective immediately; everyone present  votes in favor of replacing Winnie as Captain. Winnie protests, dismissing CH's style as "ghetto", and Rihanna responds that she will judge the squad by what they bring to the table and not by where they come from. Rihanna ultimately selects Crenshaw Heights as the winners, and the Pacific Vista squad  come forward to congratulate them. At the credits, CH team performs in Rihanna's video. Britney and Jesse make up, kissing backstage after their first performance. The movie ends with a made-for-movie music video of Rihanna's Pon De Replay with the Crenshaw Heights squad dancing in the background.
