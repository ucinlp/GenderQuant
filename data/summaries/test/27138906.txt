Adam , a former central African swimming champion, is the security guard at the swimming pool of an expensive hotel. As conflict looms, he is demoted to the post of gate security guard, his son Abdel taking his former job at the pool. The local chief pressures Adam into supporting Chad's fight against rebel forces, chastising him for not attending a cause meeting. The chief tells Adam of how he sent his 17 year old son to fight in the war. He also tells Adam he has three days to pay money to support the cause. In desperation, Adam volunteers Abdel for the army. Troops come to the family's home to forcibly collect Abdel, informing his mother he has been drafted. Adam resumes his job as pool attendant. A young woman presents herself at Adam and his wife's home, telling them she is Abdel's girlfriend and is expecting his child. They take her in as their daughter. The conflict worsens and the townspeople begin to flee. Adam travels to liberate Abdel from the army. He finds Abdel badly wounded and smuggles him out under the cover of night. On the journey home Abdel says he wishes to swim in the river. Adam takes him to the river to discover he has died upon arrival. Adam floats Abdel's body off down the river.
