An aircraft carrying young military school cadets returning home crash lands into the sea near a remote, uninhabited, jungle island. Among the survivors is the pilot, Captain Benson , who is seriously injured and delirious. On the island, an overweight cadet, whose real name is not revealed, but gets nicknamed “Piggy” , finds a conch seashell and takes it to the group of cadets, who adopt it to signal the right to speak and be heard by the group. Ralph , the most senior cadet , and one of the oldest boys, calls a meeting to discuss surviving their predicament. Ralph and Jack  emerge dominant, with Ralph's seniority in rank making him the one in charge. Tensions begin to grow between Ralph, focused on rescue, and Jack, focused on hunting and survivng, however, and the group eventually becomes divided between the two leaders when Jack, tired of listening to Ralph and Piggy, leaves and forms his own camp, taking a majority of the boys with him. One night, as they sleep, the delusional Capt. Benson wanders into the jungle, eventually making his way to a cave deep inland. Later, one of the boys, Larry , in the darkness of the cave, mistakes Capt. Benson for a wild animal and kills him. Expecting to be rescued, Ralph's civilized leadership maintains a permanent signal-fire to alert passing ships of their presence on the island. Not expecting to be rescued, Jack's savage leadership adapts to circumstance; he establishes his camp as spear-bearing hunters. They kill a wild pig and leave its head as an offering to "the beast" that they believe is in the cave. One night, using a glow stick, Simon  explores the cave where the “beast” was killed, and discovers the cadaver of Capt. Benson. He runs to alert the boys of his discovery, interrupting a tense meeting of the two groups. Before he can do so, however, Simon's waving of the light leads him to be mistaken for the beast and Jack's group stabs him to death with their spears as Ralph and Piggy watch in horror. Later, Piggy's glasses are stolen by Jack's group. Piggy and Ralph travel to Jack's camp, attempting to call a meeting using the conch. Piggy insists that everyone be sensible and work together, but Jack's savage followers refuse to listen. As they jeer him, Roger  pushes a boulder off a cliff and smashes Piggy's head, causing his death. A distraught Ralph swears that Jack will not get away with this, but Jack declares that Ralph is now on his own as Simon and Piggy are dead and all the other cadets have defected and joined Jack. Jack and his savages throw stones at Ralph to drive him away. The next day, Jack and his hunters begin setting the jungle on fire to force Ralph out of hiding so they can kill him. Just barely dodging the spreading fire and Jack's hunters, Ralph makes a desperate run to the sea, where he encounters a United States Marine Corps officer  who has just landed on the island with other Marines. He is surprised to see them there, and asks what they are doing. Ralph begins to sob while a shocked, guilty, and horrified Jack and his stunned hunters look on in silence.
