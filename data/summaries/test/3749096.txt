Living in Manhattan, Tom  is a cook who has a hard time holding down his job. His wife, Sofia , is an attorney. When their first child is born, they agree that she will be a full-time mom and he will work to get a promotion. When Tom gets fired over defending his friend Paco , he takes a job in Ohio working at the ad agency where his father-in-law is the assistant director. Tom is assigned to report to Chip . Chip is a competitive and hard-driving wheelchair-using man who is coincidentally Sofia's ex-boyfriend from high school. Chip still carries a desire for her, so he conspires to make Tom's work life miserable. As Tom's frustrations mount, Chip begins to sway Sofia to his side. Tom begins to suspect that Chip isn't handicapped at all and goes through his desk. He finds a photo of Chip playing tennis and rushes to his in-laws' house to see his wife and show her the picture. He finds Chip having dinner with Sofia and her parents and holding Tom's child. Tom angrily tries to prove that Chip is not actually paralyzed and pulls him up a flight of stairs and drops him, expecting him to stand up to prevent falling. Chip doesn't stand up and Tom is humiliated in front of his family. Later, he apprehends Chip outside and fights him, where Chip reveals that he really can walk, but can't fight outside of his chair. After sitting back down, Chip beats him soundly and reveals that he plans to sleep with Sofia, much to Tom's already-increased anger. It's revealed that Paco, Tom's friend, had called Chip under the guise of being an ad agency boss in Barcelona, telling Chip that he got a job and convincing him to fly to Spain. Excited by the news, Chip goes to Sofia about the news and asks her to come with him. However, Tom confronts them both and convinces her not to go with Chip. Chip, not liking that Sofia chose Tom over him, callously insults Tom and reveals he "faked his orgasm" to Sofia before gets out of his chair and walks out. While mocking them from outside, Chip is hit by a bus and ends up breaking both his legs. Tom and Sofia have moved out of Ohio and Sofia's dad is helping Tom start his own ad company. Tom and Sofia are shown to have switched positions, Tom becoming a stay-at-home dad while Sofia becomes a full-time worker. During the credits Chip is shown being tossed out of the ad company in Spain, and later on Tom's friend sees Chip in the middle of the running of the bulls on TV.
