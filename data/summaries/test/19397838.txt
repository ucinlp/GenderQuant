 While sailing their toy tugboat in a puddle outside their house, Wally and Spanky notice a moving van with a child-sized fire engine riding into the neighborhood. They quickly round up the rest of the gang, and follow the moving van to its destination. The fire truck's owner, a snobbish rich kid named Jerry, comes out to find a dozen strange children playing with his fire engine and shoos them all away, refusing to trade any sorts of collateral  for even a ride. When Wally's girl Jane turns up, however, Jerry is quick to offer her a ride. Wally tries to dissuade Jane from riding with Jerry by telling her that the gang has a fire engine of its own, big enough to hold all of them. Jane agrees to a ride with Wally in his fire engine after she gets back from her ride with Jerry. Wally, Stymie, and the gang quickly begin building a makeshift fire engine of their own, "borrowing" wheels, hoses, plywood, and other raw materials from around the neighborhood. As the older kids work on the fire engine, little Spanky and Scotty find themselves forced out of the proceedings, and sit on the sidelines giving commentary on the building process. Unknown to the kids, Jerry sneaks over to the gang's barn with Jane, hoping to prove the gang does not have a fire engine. He quickly ends up running away, however, when a drill from the other side of the barn door relieves him of his pants. The unwieldy results of their labor fail to impress Jane, whom Jerry successfully coaxes into another ride with him. The gang follows them, and Jerry challenges them to a race to the bottom of a steep hill. Not long after the start of the race, the gang's fire engine loses its brake  and Jerry fears that the gang might very well run him over. Halfway down the hill, he leaps out of his fire engine into a lawn, leaving Jane alone to crash in the next yard over. While the gang cheers in victory, their fire engine suddenly veers onto the sidewalk, where they knock over several pedestrians and ride straight through a hedge, which tears their clothes and causes them to emerge from the other side in their underwear.
