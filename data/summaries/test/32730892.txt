The Plot is about a runaway rogue by the name of Harmony, after her village is attacked and plundered by the raiders, she escapes the inevitable torment to find safety in a nearby cave, where she finds a wounded survivor by the name of Anderson, whom she disregards and obviously despises. She eventually agrees to travel with Anderson to find food and shelter. Eventually, while they are traveling, they get caught by a raider named Dempster, a bounty hunter sent out by the commander Slater. He takes them to his motorcycle where he ties Anderson to a tree and tries to attack Harmony after she tries to escape. Harmony kills Dempster with a rock and goes hysterical and threatens to leave Anderson to die. He convinces her to let him go and help her in order to get to a rumored safe haven, the whereabouts of it is unknown by Anderson and Harmony. They take Dempster's motorcycle and ride until the gas tank gets empty. After they stop, they notice a traveling group of infected of the Plague. They begin to journey on foot until they come to a fortified ruins where a group of criminally insane, disease-infested cannibals who offer them what they call "deer meat". Harmony asks to use the outhouse, where she finds a bunch of dead bodies and almost gets attacked and raped by one of the cannibals. When she arrives back in the house, she warns Anderson about the meat, she then throws her bowl of food at the cannibal and ties him up. On the journey again, Harmony senses that the other two cannibals are following them, so Anderson and Harmony hide in some bushes. Harmony then sneaks away and gets found by one of the cannibals, where they have a brief scuffle ending in an unknown winner of the fight. Harmony sneaks back up behind Anderson and scares him as a gag, he becomes enraged and they begin to argue. They again journey onward until they talk again and then are ambushed by a group of unknown assailants wearing tattered clothing to conceal their identities. It is revealed that they have the Plague and Anderson and Harmony begin to argue after the fight is over. They continue their journey until Anderson claims that it is getting late and they should camp out soon, Harmony then notices creeps stalking around the rocky ruins. They then decide to find high ground to spend the night. During the night, Anderson rolls over onto Harmony while he is asleep, and Harmony becomes terrified, impulsively grabbing her knife, until he rolls back over to sleep, and she becomes restful. In the morning, a loud bang and a screeching rumbling noise awake Harmony and Anderson into a surprise. They sneak to the edge of the cliff to find out that raiders are attacking a nearby village. Anderson then recognizes Purvis, one of Slater's prime maniacs, standing on a hilltop with other officers. The villagers try to repel the murderous raiders at their gates on a catwalk where a gunfight is taking place. Many of the raiders and villagers die in battle, until the raiders break into the city by exploding the wooden fence, then the stampede of motorcycling raiders swarm the interior of the village. Anderson and Harmony attempt to sneak into the area and take their motorcycles to escape in a rush. While the raiders are on their rape quests, Anderson and Harmony attack an injured biker and steal his motorcycle after they bludgeon him. While they try to start the engine, a raider sees Harmony and goes after her, but she defeats him and they make their way out of the area, during their escape, a raider announces that some of the villagers are getting away, Purvis looks through a spyglass and notices that it is Anderson, and rallies up his crew to go after them. While Anderson and Harmony are riding away, they see that a group of the raiders have rendezvous with them and are on hot pursuit. Anderson attempts to escape from a mountain pass into a small downhill valley, with Purvis and his raiders following them. Anderson parks the bike and shoots one of the raiders, Purvis figures a plan and orders his other two men to capture the duo. Anderson and Harmony started to escape uphill until Harmony purposefully jumps of the bike in order to stall the raiders. The raiders decide to leave and as they are driving away, Harmony looks on and notices she is bing stalked by an obese raider. Anderson comes to a stop to check his gas fuelage, until he is captured by Purvis, who has a hand crossbow aimed at him. Anderson attempts to joke at Purvis and stall him while Harmony comes to rescue him. She sneaks behind him and holds him up with a twig and a small Luger pistol. They leave him in his frozen stance while a rattle snake climbs on hit boot. On their adventure once more, they notice a man stuck on a rock being stalked by simple canine dogs. Anderson shoots at the rock and scares the dogs off for the traveler to get down. The traveler, Orland, and his puppy then get accompanied by Anderson and Harmony for a certain distance. After the hill, Anderson and Harmony then leave Orland and his puppy on a hilltop. As they are riding away, Anderson and Harmony get captured by the raiders and Orland witnesses it. He follows the truck that they were taken in. Anderson and Harmony are taken to Slater, the lord of the raiders, which is in a cave used as the headquarters for the raiders. Slater examines Harmony as an interest to become a prostitute, he tries to coerce her with riches and sex at his cave, but she just spits in his face. She then escapes free and grabs a nearby lead pipe and fights with the raiders as Anderson, who is still held captive by burly raiders, and prostitutes look on. She tries to fend them off but they advance on her and rip some of her clothing off and bring her to Slater. Purvis comes back and threatens Anderson for leaving him with the snake. Slater pushed Purvis down and orders to take Anderson and Harmony to the prison cells, then he stares at Purvis, whilst on the ground. Meanwhile, Orland and his puppy are still traveling after the truck that took Anderson and Harmony away when they were captured. Orland abandons his bike and leaves his puppy at the base of a rock hill as he runs up to find the raiders. He comes to the top of a rock cliff and sees the raiders' outpost with a lookout tower and a gas tanker. Orland turns back to realize he can't find his puppy, while he is searching for her, he falls into a hole in the rock and lands in a small tomb. He finds his puppy and also a group of gathering strange-speaking midgets who attack him, unknowing of what his fate becomes. Returning to Anderson and Harmony, captured and chained to a rock wall over a campfire. After a conversation, Purvis and a group of raiders comes in to announce the time of Anderson's sacrifice. They unchain them both and bring them in front of Slater, at his throne, and an assembly of raiders. Harmony is then taken across a wood beam to be chained again over a roasting fire. Out of the sudden nowhere, Orland jumps into the cave and spreads fire and flames on anything with a flamethrower. In the midst of fear, Anderson escapes and attacks Slater, who eventually runs and hides behind his tapestry while Anderson steals a gun from one of the raiders and helps Orland kills the rest of the raiders. The three of them escape through a secret door while Purvis and a battalion of raiders follow behind them through the fire. The three of the survivors come to a secluded spot in the cave where the strange-speaking midgets hold all their weapons and Orland explains their understandings. The cloaked midgets lead Anderson, Harmony, and Orland to a secret escape above the raider camp, where they begin to shoot from above, an all out battle begins between the raiders and the trio of survivors. The three of them escape as Purvis looks for them in their secret hideaway, until Orland discovers their oil tank and begins to light it on fie until it explodes as they make an escape. The trio shoot all the raiders' fuel preserves and eventually escape on foot. Purvis and his raiders emerge from the smokey outpost, he leads them on the way to find the trio of survivors. Orland finds one of the raiders' abandoned trucks and hotwires it and lets the three of them escape in the truck. Purvis orders his men to follow them on the bikes. The bikers follow the trio of survivors as they drive down the road and shoot at their truck. The trio come to a stop at a bridge and notice the midgets helping them keep the raiders at bay. The trio makes it across the bridge and the truck explodes, preventing Purvis and his raiders from trekking across the bridge. Finally, Orland decides to depart from Anderson and Harmony and return to his midget friends and his puppy, until he hears a screaching noise, revealing to be Slater, back for revenge. Orland runs away in fear and Anderson and Harmony look back to see what is wrong, only to find out that Slater is after them again, his only reply, "Oh, shit! Here we go again!" as Orland catches up to them and they all start running away up the hill as the camera pans out into the credits...
