Henry Dewlip is the heir to his late father's prosperous automobile plant. He lets underlings run things while he indulges in wine, women and song, stringing women along. Julia Jelliwell is the latest woman to have the key to his apartment but there are problems, like her husband. Also the straight-laced Miss Smith, his latest secretary who secretly harbours a crush on him. She manages to spoil things with Julia and then to try to get him to take an interest in his car plant, spoiling a chance for Johnny to sell him a carburetor. Things fall flat when Henry finds that not only was Miss Smith previously married but she has a baby. This upsets Henry and the butler takes the chance to reinstate the old system that worked so well, as he calls Julia. At a mission for reforming souls, a fight ensues and both Henry and Julia end up in cells. Finally released, he now has a cold. Later he dictates to Miss Smith in a sharp voice and she says that her husband is dead. She shot him a year previously in Paris. Henry quickly falls out of love with her and goes back to Julia. Henry takes Johnny's carburetor business into his motor business and takes up with Julia. Meanwhile Johnny has been smitten by Miss Smith.
