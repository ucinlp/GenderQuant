Heavy fog wreaks havoc among air travelers throughout England. When outspoken Cynthia Beeston  insists on being taken from London Airport to Blackbushe Airport, where she might be able to fly to Dublin, harassed airline employees find emergency relief coach 13 and reserve driver Percy Lamb  to transport her, mild-mannered Henry Waterman , pulp-thriller addict Janie Grey  and Ernest Schroeder . To satisfy a regulation, stewardess "Nikki" Nicholls  is assigned to shepherd them. Rounding out the party is airline first officer Peter Jones , who hitches a ride. Unbeknownst to most of them, robbers have stolen Â£200,000 worth of gold bullion from the airport bonded store and hidden the proceeds in the boot of the coach. Two of the crooks are caught; under questioning by Inspector Henley ([[John Horsley , one breaks down and admits the gold was stowed on the coach and that the mysterious and notorious "Banker" is the mastermind. Henley informs Percy by radio, but the fog is so thick, Percy has no idea where he is. In mid-call, Peter pokes what feels like a gun into Percy's back and tells him to keep driving. They wind up at a deserted booby-trapped village used by the Army for training. When Schroeder finds a Sten gun, Peter grabs it. Schroeder then informs him that it does not work, and produces a pistol of his own. After a scuffle, it turns out that Peter is working for airport security, while Schroeder is a policeman. Miss Beeston - the Banker - ends up with the gun, and her henchman Henry tries to start the coach. Percy saves the day, having removed the rotor from the engine, and knocking the pistol out of Miss Beeston's hand with a stone.
