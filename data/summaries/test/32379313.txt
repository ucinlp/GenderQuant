Porky Pig is eating large amounts of food to the rhythm of an exercise radio broadcast. A mouse then proceeds to sneak up and makes a sandwich out of Porky's finger. Porky then tries to drive the mouse off, but then he is suddenly startled by a radio announcement that killer Bluebeard is at large and Porky frantically bars and locks up his house. The mouse then decides to bully Porky by disguising himself as Bluebeard and threatening Porky until he offers him some food. As Porky is busy getting the mouse a drink, he is alerted by a radio newsflash that gives Bluebeard's height away as 6' 11. Porky then measures the rodent as 3 inches. Porky pursues the mouse with a meat cleaver. Then Porky pulls out the real Bluebeard by accident from under the table. While Porky is strapped to a rocket, the mouse pretends to be Bluebeard's conscience in the middle of his meal. The harassment then continues and ends with Bluebeard getting hit five times by the mouse with pies to the face in various containers. Meanwhile, Porky manages to stop the fuse on the rocket and Bluebeard builds a gullotine to kill Porky instead. Just as Porky is about to be executed by Bluebeard, the mouse decides to help Porky by tricking Bluebeard into eating some bombs. Bluebeard desperately tries to get rid of them but fails and he is blown to pieces. Then Porky is happily eating but with the mouse eating as well. The mouse then shows and pats his fat tummy.
