Alou, a Senegalese man that has entered Spain illegally can only find occasional jobs due to his situation. Thanks to the letters he sends regularly to his parents, we hear of his experiences and feelings as he laboriously tries to be integrated into Spanish society. He starts out on the coast of Almeria, working in the greenhouses. Then he travels to Madrid where he first comes into contact with illegal sales. He then makes his way to Segria to work harvesting fruit and, finally, to Barcelona, where he works in the clothes shop of another African immigrant. His adventure comes to an abrupt end when heâ€™s arrested by the police. But he crosses the Straight again, closing the circle that leaves a door open to hope.
