One night, Mario was engrossed in his Famicom game. Suddenly, the picture goes out and Princess Peach appears on the TV screen crying for help from the enemies attacking her and jumps out of the TV. Mario vows to protect her. Soon after, Bowser appears on the TV screen and starts to come out of the TV. He grabs Princess Peach and takes her into the TV. Mario then discovers a small necklace that Peach left on the floor. The next day while the brothers are working as grocery store clerks, the necklace that Peach dropped becomes a matter of concern for Mario. Luigi immediately notices the broach and regards it as the "Visionary Jewel from the Country of Treasure". Soon, Kibidango, a small dog-like entity, wanders into the store and snatches the necklace from Mario. Mario and Luigi pursue after Kibidango into the Mushroom Kingdom. When the Mario brothers arrive at the kingdom, a large Mushroom Sennin tells them that Bowser has taken over the kingdom and is turning the helpless citizens into blocks and that on Friday the 13th, Bowser will marry Peach. By finding the three powers, the mushroom of strength, the flower of courage, and the yellow star of invincibility, the Mario Brothers will be able to defeat Bowser and save Princess Peach. Throughout the many perilous obstacles, Mario finally finds all the three powers by Friday the 13th. When night arises, the wedding of Bowser and Peach begins to take place. Mario arrives and beats up Bowser enlisting the help of the three powers, and Bowser's magic is destroyed, bringing back the Mushroom Kingdom that was before Bowser came along. Mario gives Peach's broach back to her, which reveals Kibidango's true identity, Prince Haru of the Flower Kingdom, who says that Koopa transformed him into an animal. He then tells Mario and Luigi that he and Peach are betrothed to each other and are fated to marry no matter what. Although heartbroken at first, Mario decides to leave the Mushroom Kingdom and allow Peach to marry Prince Haru as was previously planned. Following a tearful farewell from Princess Peach, the credits consist of Mario and Luigi leaving the Mushroom Kingdom and making their long journey home. After the credits, Mario and Luigi wave at the camera while they enter the pump. The final scene is Bowser and his minions have humorously reformed, now working in Mario and Luigi's grocery store. The screen fades to blue and a title pops up, stating "Game Over".
