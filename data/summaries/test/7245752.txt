The film takes place during the 1930s, when the Japanese were occupying China. During the occupation Chi Keung's  mother is killed. Chi himself is presumed dead, but is later saved by his friend Yip. They travel to Beijing where Yip can stay with his aunt. Unfortunately, a Japanese fighter, Shojiro, comes to town and wants to show off his martial arts expertise by brawling with Chi's master. The master wins the fight, but Shojiro's father has the master killed. An angry Chi punches and kicks his way to Shojiro, and finds that Shojiro did not want the master to die, and it was merely a way for his father to save face. Chi says that he will not kill Shojiro, but only if Shojiro never steps foot in China again. However, this doesn't last long, and Shojiro  and Chi  meet for one final confrontation on the Great Wall of China.
