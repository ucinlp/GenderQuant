Retired Russian Special Forces hit man Nikolai "Nick" Cherenko  is a simple man trying to live a simple life in his small Russian town. He has a pretty wife named Alina , a son named Vanya , and a successful profession as an automobile mechanic. But one day, Russian mob boss Sasha Popov  and his gang come to town. Caught in the crossfire is Nick's family. When the smoke clears, Alina and Vanya lie dead in the streets. Nick arms himself and tracks down Sasha and his gang, cornering them in a drug deal and laying waste. Years later, Nick emigrates to the U.S. and takes a job as a car mechanic in Los Angeles. And then wealthy Mary Abramoff  tracks him down. She pleads with him to go to Russia and retrieve her daughter Julia , who has been kidnapped and forced into the sex trade. Mary knows Nick's past and, though he is initially reluctant, when she shows him a picture of the kidnapper, he changes his mind: it is Sasha Popov, somehow alive after Nick shot him in the face years ago. Nick takes the next plane to St. Petersburg, Russia, and he joins up with a band of mercenaries led by British mercenary William Burton . Their mission is clear: free Julia from Sasha, and mow down anyone who stands in their way.
