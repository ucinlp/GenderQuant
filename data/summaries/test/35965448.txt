In 1958, the Catholic Church is investigating the case of a mysterious individual, Giacomo Nerone , who is said to have performed miracles in a remote village in southern Italy, before being executed by German troops in 1944. The process involves a "Devil's advocate", who is tasked with discovering any details about the subject's life that would indicate their canonisation would be inappropriate. Monsignor Blaise Meredith  is given this responsibility, shortly after he learns he has terminal cancer. Meredith discovers that Nerone was actually a British soldier named James Black, who had become detached from the British Army during WW2 and was hiding in this village, where he began a relationship with a local woman. The film touches on homosexuality in the priesthood, persecution of Jews and other topics.
