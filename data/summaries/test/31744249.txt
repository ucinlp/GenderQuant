Michelle films her boyfriend and asks questions about the first day they met. The narrative flashes back and forth from this 'present day' video log, to the nervous, and semi-awkward going-ons of the protagonist  getting ready for girls to come over to his house. Uncomfortable moments, embarrassing camp stories, and confrontations between drifting friends ensue...it feels like that first break back home from college.
