The plot features Sellers as a naive but caring prison chaplain accidentally assigned as vicar to a small and prosperous country town of Orbiston Parva, in place of Ian Carmichael's upper-class cleric, with whom he shares a name. His belief in charity and forgiveness sets him at odds with the locals, whose assertions that they are good, Christian people are in Smallwood's view belied by their behaviour and ideas. He creates social ructions by appointing a black dustman  as his churchwarden, taking in a gypsy family, and persuading local landowner Lady Despard  to provide free food for the church to distribute free to the people of the town. However, all his good works lead to trouble.
