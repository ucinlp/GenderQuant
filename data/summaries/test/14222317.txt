Ginger  is a driven real estate agent, eager to have the better things in life, and passionate about realizing a lifelong dream â€“ to revisit Doheny Beach in southern California, which she visited once as a teenager. Her family grudgingly forgoes its annual trip to Branson, Missouri, and grants Ginger her cherished California dream for her fortieth birthday. The RV trip to the West Coast turns into an odyssey with a dizzying array of psychological shipwrecks and unintended detours. When it appears that things can't get worse, a dog leads the entire ensemble into a maze of cataclysmic events that bring the family closer together, although the family ultimately abandons the trip to California, and just stays at home for "vacation".
