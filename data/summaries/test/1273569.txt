During the French Revolution, the Scarlet Pimpernel, , who is really Sir Percy Blakeney in disguise, risks his life to rescue French noblemen from the guillotine and take them across the English Channel to safety. As cover, Sir Percy poses as a fop at Court, and curries favor with the Prince of Wales  by providing advice about fashion, but secretly he leads The League, a group of noblemen with similar views. Chauvelin, French Ambassador of the Revolution to England  wants to find out who the Pimpernel is and bring him in to meet his fate under French justice. When evidence points to Sir Percy, Chauvelin blackmails Blakeney's wife, Marguerite  by threatening to expose her criminal brother Armand , but Marguerite doesn't believe her husband is capable of being the daring Pimpernel.
