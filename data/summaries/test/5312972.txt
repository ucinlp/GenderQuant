A psychological portrait of relationships and sexual desire. Diana and her husband Julian decide to try swinging with another couple for the first time. They invite Alex and Timo over to their house for a weekend-long experiment. Alex and Timo are confident swingers, especially gorgeous Alex, whose ravishing sexiness intimidates quiet Diana. And Timo seems strangely uninterested. But once night falls and their sexual exploration begins, we discover that all is not as it seems. Diana may have more quiet strength in her than she knows.
