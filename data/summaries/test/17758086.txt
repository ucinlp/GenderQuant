Thomas Zelda  has been paroled from prison for being involved in movie piracy. He is picked up by his eccentric sister Vicky  who is revealed to be a habitual liar . He arrives at Vicky's home where he plans to spend some time putting his life back together when it's revealed that his mother was told  that he went to France instead of prison. Due to her heart condition, Tommy keeps as the story leading to a euphemism where France means "prison" . During dinner, Gray , Tommy's old partner from the movie piracy business, shows up and his sister runs him off. The next day, Tommy meets with his parole officer, Angela Popadopolous , who requires him to work at a pirate-themed restaurant called "Pirate Burger" as part of his parole. He informs Angela that he wants to start up his father's painting business instead, but is told that he is required to work at the restaurant. While on the job, he sees Christy , his "dead" ex-girlfriend come up to the drive-through window. Realizing Vicky lied to him, he takes the delivery car to see Christy leading them to spend the night together. The next morning, it is revealed that Christy is engaged to Frank  and Tommy is forced to escape the apartment. Since he took the delivery car without permission, he is fired as from "Pirate Burger" and risks going back to jail for breaking the terms of his parole. He is given another chance and goes back to work at Pirate Burger. That night, he is "kidnapped" by Gray and Gray tries to get him to get back into the piracy business. Tommy refuses stating that he wants to "go straight". Tommy is called to make a delivery. He arrives at the apartment of Angela. Her son is trying to play matchmaker to get her to start dating again. While there, he notices that the apartment is in need of a paint job. Tommy decides to show Angela the kind of work he can do so, with the help of two ex-con coworkers  from Pirate Burger, he breaks into Angela's apartment while she's away and repaints the living room. Meanwhile, the fictional story about Tommy's "France" trip continues to evolve including a relationship with Simone, a French astronaut who was killed on the launchpad so that Tommy's mother would not fly everyone to France to meet Simone . Angela is furious at Tommy for breaking and entering but understands what he was trying to do and doesn't press charges. She sets him up to paint a judge's home. While doing the job, Angela shows up to check on Tommy's work and invite him to observe her son's little league team. The judge's wife, later, impressed by the work, invites Tommy to paint the upstairs as well. While getting tools together, Edgar and Rick prepare the upstairs for painting and knock the judge's wife's diamond ring off the dresser. Edgar, wanting to do something nice for Tommy, steals the ring and gives it to Christy as a "gift from Tommy". Tommy, who doesn't know that the theft occurred, joins Angela at the little league game and they begin to express feelings for each other. They set up a formal date. When Tommy arrives at Angela's apartment for the date, Angela is furious over the theft and demands the ring back. He goes to Pirate Burger to confront Edgar and Rick, but they have disappeared. He steals the delivery car  and calls Edgar and Rick. They inform him of the ring's location and he drives to Christy's house to get the ring back. After a short confrontation with Frank and Christy, he gets the ring and returns it to Angela. The manager of Pirate Burger presses charges on Tommy and he goes back to jail. Gray shows up at the prison to bail him out and, disillusioned with his attempts to "go straight", Tommy joins back up with Gray. While this happens, Angela's son shows up at Vicky's house wanting to see Tommy, but he is not there. Vicky finds Tommy with Gray at the airport and makes up a story about Angela's son going missing. Tommy chooses to abandon Gray at the airport  to find Angela's son. When he shows up at Angela's apartment, he finds out that Vicky has, again, lied to him. His concern for the well being Angela's son, however, softens Angela's animosity towards Tommy. He invites  Angela to join in a dinner at Vicky's house. Angela shows up for the dinner. A story Vicky told Tommy's mother about Angela being Tommy's "grief counselor" falls apart when Angela informs her that she is actually Tommy's parole officer, which also causes the France story to fall apart. The movie ends with Vicky trying to act surprised but no one is buying it.
