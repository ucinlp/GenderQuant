There are three main heroes in this movie: Vera, a waitress; Platon, a pianist; and... a train station where these two people met. The differences in the heroes’ characters and professions, the plight that Platon found himself in  trigger a host of both amusing and sad situations which serve as a backdrop for their unfolding love. Platon is innocent of the crime he is accused of. He simply took the blame for his wife’s driving over a pedestrian. But this is known only to Platon’s wife and Vera in whom he confided. However, after the verdict has been passed, Platon’s life is of no interest to his wife, although Vera is ready to wait for his release.
