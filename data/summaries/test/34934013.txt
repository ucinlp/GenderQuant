June, 1967, on the eve of the Six Day War. The Sparrow follows a young police officer stationed in a small village in Upper Egypt whose inhabitants suffer the harassment of a corrupt businessman. The police officer crosses paths with a journalist who is investigating what appears to be a scandal involving the theft of weapons and war machinery by high officials. Youssef Chahine offers us a portrait of the “sparrows”, the simple people of his country whom others use to get rich.
