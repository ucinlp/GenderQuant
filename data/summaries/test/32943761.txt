Richard Gannon discovers his wife Amy has been cheating on him with a man called Jim Williams and accidentally kills her in a fit of anger by pushing her over a cliff. He is arrested and sentenced to death but the judge recommends mercy and asks the Home Secretary for a reprieve. The Home Secretary at first refuses, but when he mistakenly comes to believe that his own wife is unfaithful, he releases how easy it would have been to kill her. After this, he grants a reprieve for Gannon and resolves to show his wife more affection.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900â€“1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, p45{{cite news}}
