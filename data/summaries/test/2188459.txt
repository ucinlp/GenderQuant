The film shows how a naive and trusting 16 year old Laurie Show  became entangled in the lives of Lisa Michelle Lambert  and her boyfriend, Lawrence Yunkin. Lambert initially befriended Show, but after Yunkin allegedly raped Show, Lambert became jealous and enraged, convinced Show was pursuing Yunkin. Lambert began a campaign of harassment, stalking Show, often with the assistance of friends. On December 20, 1991, Laurie Show was murdered in her home by Lambert and Lambert's friend, Tabitha Buck; Show's mother found her. Lambert, Yunkin, and Buck were quickly arrested. Yunkin pled guilty and testified against Lambert in exchange for a reduced sentence of 20 years, and Lambert and Buck were convicted and sentenced to life without parole. During Laurie Show's harassment and stalking, there were no anti-stalking laws in Pennsylvania.
