Two kids debate about if they should go to school or not. One of the kids, Stanley, decides to go to school because they might actually learn something this time which makes the other kid shrug and walk away. His teacher, Miss Given, hands out the answers to everything and the only problem is that he has to share his copy with a school bully named Garth.
