Italy, year 2061: After a terrible energy crisis due to the depletion of oil stocks, the Earth is plunged into a kind of new Middle Ages. Italy as a nation no longer exists, the peninsula has returned to being a divided country, almost pre-Risorgimento, where now reigns the political situation is similar to that before the reunification of 1861: * The secessionist of Lega Nord have occupied Milan, creating the Republic with the Lombard capital, Turin, defended by a high wall erected on the Po River to block the entrance to the "southerners"; * In Emilia-Romagna has been proclaimed "People's Republic of Sickle and Mortadella", which decimated the mortadella, the rubles and dance halls; * Tuscany is back to being a Grand Duchy, where factions of Della Valle and Cecchi Gori struggling for power; * At the Center is reborn the Papal State, a fundamentalist regime dominated by the Inquisition; * The South has been invaded instead by Africans, who have created the rich "Sultanate of the Two Sicilies", an Islamic state where Arabic is the official language. Just from the South, a group of adventurous patriots of the insurrectional movement "Young Italy", made up of volunteers Tony, Pride, Grosso, Salvim and Taned, and led by Ademaro Maroncelli  undertakes a difficult journey to the Piedmont, in order, two hundred years later, to remake Italy.
