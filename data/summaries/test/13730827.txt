The Stooges are used chariot salesmen in Ancient Egypt. They make the mistake of swindling Rhadames, the captain of the royal guard  and he has them promptly arrested. The Stooges are forced to appear before King Rootentootin , who is suffering from a painful toothache. Seeing an opportunity to redeem themselves, Moe informs the King that Shemp is an expert dentist known as Painless Papyrus. Shemp goes about trying to extract the troublesome tooth, resulting in the nearsighted Stooge squashing the King's nose with a pair of pliers. The tooth, however, is removed and the King rewards the Stooges by making them royal chamberlains.  As they assume their new roles, the trio uncover a plot where the King's tax collector Tutamon  is stealing the tax money. Once again, the King is indebted to the Stooges and offers his daughter Fatima's  hand in marriage.
