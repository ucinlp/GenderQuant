Kadhir  belongs to a lower middle class family, living with his parents and his younger sister in Rainbow Colony. He is perceived as a good for nothing person as he skips classes, fails in exams, and gets involved in fights. Kadhir believes that his father hates him and often quarrels with him, even threatening to leave the house, only to be persuaded not to do so by his mother. Kadhir's life changes when a Hindi speaking North Indian family moves into the same colony. Kadhir finds himself attracted to the daughter of that family, Anita . Although he tries to woo her, Anita treats him with disdain. Kadhir confesses to Anita that he loves her. He tells her that having always been ridiculed, he found respite in the fact that she at least cared to look at him. He promises to wipe her thoughts out of his mind, as he is not right for her. Despite himself, Kadhir continues pursuing her. Anita realizes that Kadhir is not such a useless fellow when his best friend tells her that he can dismantle and assemble a motorcycle within minutes. She takes Kadhir to a Hero Honda dealer and asks them to offer him a job. He is promised a job if he can assemble a bike. Initially, Kadhir is disinterested and gives up the task. She tells him that she loves him and asks how he would take care of her without a job. Kadhir then demonstrates his skill in motorcycle assembly, securing a job with the dealer. His father feels proud of his son for the first time, when Kadhir gives him his offer letter. Though he refuses to openly praise Kadhir, he does so secretly to Kadhir's mother that night. Overhearing the conversation, Kadhir realizes his father's love for him and weeps.
