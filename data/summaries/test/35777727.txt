The two best friends Karat and Sludge would like to grow, but they cannot do it unless someone or something saves Hera, the planet where they live. Juneau is another planet where it seems you can live, but to reach that place the two friends must leave Hera against the wishes of the elderly: Juneau is extremely dangerous and for this reason they impose a prohibition upon visiting it. However, Karat and Sludge decide to ignore any warning, and so escape to Juneau. The new planet seems to be a land of true life and adventure, but soon the desire for growth is distorted by lies and deceit. Sludge becomes a prisoner and Karat is almost forced to abandon the planet. Trying to save Sludge, Karat discovers all of Juneau's most terrible secrets: Juneau is precisely the reason why Hera is dying. When Sludge regains his freedom, he and his best friend fight together against the evil that is destroying their home and threatening their very existence. Hera's life force is restored and Sludge and Karat, forgiven by the elders, can finally grow.
