A year after becoming the toast of New York City's art scene, photographer Max Martin has lost his ability to take a decent picture. On the night before his make-or-break gallery opening, surrounded by the trappings of success but devoid of inspiration, Max embarks on a bizarre trek through the city in search of ten mysterious photographs that could save his career. Accompanied by an unlikely crew of strangers he meets along the way, Max trips through a modern-day Oz, and rediscovers the easily forgotten value of seeing magic reflected in everyday life.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240802/plotsummary
