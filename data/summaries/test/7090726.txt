In Norco, California, four men plot a bank robbery using heavy ammunition to intimidate clients and the police force expecting to have better life. However, one employee activates the silent alarm in the police station, and the criminals are chased by the police and LA SWAT. In despair, they fire about 20,000 shots, kill one policeman, hit eight others, and damage many cars and one helicopter. In the end, the two survivors are sentenced to life without parole.
