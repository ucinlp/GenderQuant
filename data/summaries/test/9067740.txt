Porky Pig begins ploughing his land and planting seeds, with some help from his dog Streamline. They plant many kinds of vegetables. But when the crops are ripe, a rooster sells tickets to other chickens who make a self-servicing cafe out of the field. Porky notices and tries to chase them off, but they persist. To protect the last of his crops, Porky makes a deal with the chickens to plant a separate vegetable garden for them.
