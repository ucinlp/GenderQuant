Agnes Hurley  is a frowsy and disillusioned housewife, married to Bronx cabdriver, Tom Hurley . She wants something better for her daughter, Jane . When Jane announces her engagement to Ralph Halloran , Aggie sees this as an opportunity to have an elaborate wedding, with caterers and all the trimmings, despite the fact that the family cannot afford it and the daughter does not want it. The film deals with the ensuing conflicts within the family, which also involve Uncle Jack Conlon  and most of the neighborhood. It is not until the end of the film that the vain mother realizes what a fool she has been in forcing her own fantasy onto her family.
