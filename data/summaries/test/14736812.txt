Moe and Larry read in the newspaper that the relatives of the late Professor Robert O. Link are searching for Curly Q. Link, the heir to his estate. When Curly informs Moe and Larry that Link was his uncle , the Stooges leave immediately for the reading of the will at the estate, which is a spooky, old masion. Unfortunately, the will gets stolen and all guests present for the reading are forced to spend the night. In addition, the butler informs the Stooges that there have been reports of murders and other strange happenings, including the revalation that Uncle Bob O. Link was actually murdered. In their room, the Stooges are witness to so many strange goings-on themselves that they flee in terror, knocking over the maid, who turns out to be a man in drag and the thief who stole the Link will. Curly grabs the document, anxious to know his inheritance, and learns that his uncle has bequeathed him a grand total of $0.67 net.<ref name Maurer| first  Joan Howard Maurer| coauthors  The Three Stooges Scrapbook| publisher  1982, rev. 2012| location  293| doi  | isbn  http://books.google.com/books?idfrontcover}}
