Sati, the daughter of Daksha, a descendant of Lord Brahma, marries Lord Shiva  against the wish of her father. This annoys the king  and he performs a yagna , where he invites all gods except his son-in-law . Sati attends this sacrifice against the wishes of Shiva and is insulted by her father. Unable to bear this, Sati kills herself by burning in the fire. Shiva destroys Daksha's sacrifice through Veerabhadra, cuts off Daksha's head and replaces it with that of a goat, and restores his life. Later he picks up the remain of Sati's body and performs "Rudra Thandavam", a dance that will lead to the destruction of Universe, but the other gods intervene, and the Disc of Vishnu  cuts through the Sati's corpse Her body parts, known as Shakthi Peetas, fall in several places on the Indian subcontinent.
