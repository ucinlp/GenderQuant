A group of college students head out to a cottage in the woods for a long weekend vacation. No sooner have they arrived that several of the teens wander off into the woods and disappear. More students arrive the next day. They find the mutilated remains of their friends buried in the snow. It seems someone in the woods is out to get them. The remaining teens try to escape, but one by one, the mysterious "figure" hunts them down and kills them.
