Jerry is running though a pool hall and runs into a can that Tom holds out. Tom begins shaking the can and laughs then he tips Jerry out against the wall. Jerry is then running along near one of the tables and runs up a pool cue placed by Tom and onto a cue ball on one of the tables. Tom breaks by shooting the cue ball into the rack and Jerry gets bopped on the head by the cue ball. Then, the 8-ball lands right next to the mouse and it follows Jerry off the table and into his hole, where it squishes Jerry flat. Jerry shrugs in misery until his fairy godmother visits him. Jerry acts out the situation with Tom and she gives Jerry a bottle of potion. Jerry thanks her and pokes his head out of his hole, where he sees cheese attached to a fishing line held by Tom. Jerry drinks the potion and turns invisible. He takes the cheese and gets Tom to twist his face in wonder. Jerry swipes the fishing line and pulls Tom's nose and ears backwards, ties Tom's tail, and generally keeps the cat prisoner while the invisible mouse gets some scissors. Seeing the scissors snipping in his direction Tom panics and runs up the steps at the speed of a race car, the scissors barely missing his tail. Tom hides behind a trunk, panting hard. He then pokes his head out and gets his whiskers cut off. Jerry then steps with the scissors and cuts off some of Tom's head hair. Tom flees down the steps at even greater speed and falls into a vase. Jerry then clips his tail giving it a fir tree impression. He then cuts off most of Tom's chest fur. The vase breaks and reveals Tom's horrid appearance - Tom has fur shorts and vest. Jerry laughs, holding the scissors, but soon reappears. Tom holds out a mirror, and Jerry slows his laughing. Then Tom cuts Jerry's fur to leave him with only a braw and underwear. Tom and Jerry both laugh at each other's appearance.
