As the credits roll, a visibly angry Siddharth Siddhu Addala  begins verbally abuseing all the fathers in the world. When queried about his disgust, he says that his father, Aravind , gives him more than what he asks for. He cites instances where his choices of dressing, hairstyle, and many others are overruled by his father's. However, he vows that his career and the woman he marries will be his own choice. Post-credits, Satti ([[Sunil , Addala household's dutiful servant wakes up Siddhu in the morning. In the background, Siddhu's mother, Lakshmi , is seen singing a devotional Telugu song while cooking.

When Siddhu deliberates, his father becomes impatient and plans for his marriage despite Siddhu's silent protest. The next week, Siddhu returns home to realize that he is going to get engaged to Subbulakshmi  against his wishes. He speaks with her only to realize that she is a daddy's girl  and does not take a liking to her. However, with Aravind's final say, they eventually get engaged. While contemplating on his options in a temple, Siddhu accidentally meets Hasini , an engineering student. Siddhu is attracted by her cheerful nature and energy, and the couple begin to meet on a regular basis. As the days go by, Siddhu grows to admire the ever-friendly Hasini as someone who does what she loves, and he discovers many small things which make him happy to be in her company; he realizes that he has fallen in love with her. Alongside this, Siddhu applies for a bank loan to start his construction company. When his love for Hasini deepens, he wishes to propose to her. He confesses to her that he is engaged to Subbulakshmi against his wishes, but who he really wants is her. On learning of his engagement, Hasini gets dejected, but comes back a few days later and asks him to do what he wishes for and accepts his proposal. At this juncture, the ecstatic Siddhu is seen by a furious Arvind. Siddhu is admonished back home and he expresses his disinterest in marrying Subbulakshmi.

He convinces Hasini to stay at his house after lying to her father, Kanaka Rao  that she is going on a college tour. When Hasini is introduced to Siddhu's family, she gets a lukewarm welcome. As she settles down in the house, the other family members begin to like her. Even though getting used to the living habits of the authoritarian Arvind's household is difficult, Hasini stays for Siddhu's sake. In the meanwhile, Arvind reprimands Siddhu when he finds out about his bank loan and his career plans, only to further enrage Siddhu.

Hasini realizes her father's presence and quickly exits to avoid his attention. After saving their face, Siddhu admonishes Hasini for her antics at the marriage. A sad and angry Hasini moves out of the house saying that she does not find Siddhu the same and that she cannot put on an act if she stays in their house. After getting back to her house, she rebuilds the trust her father has in her while Siddhu is left forlorn. Lakshmi confronts Arvind on Siddhu's choices and wants. In the process, Siddhu opens up his heart, leaving Arvind to repent on his over-protectiveness. Siddhu requests Subbulakshmi and her parents to call off the marriage.
