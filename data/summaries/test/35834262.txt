Bayu  is a sixth-year student who lives with his mother Wahyuni  and his grandfather Usman ; Bayu's father, an athlete turned taxi driver, died in a car accident several years before. Although Bayu wishes to be a football player like his father before him, Usman insists that he should be an artist; the grandfather enrols Bayu in numerous courses to improve his skills in the arts. Bayu sneaks in football practice with the help of his friend, the wheelchair-bound Heri , as well as Heri's driver Bang Dulloh . They find an old, empty cemetery to practise in and the guardian of the cemetery, Zahra  allows them to use it and supports Bayu's goal. Bayu is soon discovered by a coach at the local Arsenal School , which gives him a chance to play for Indonesia's National Under-13 Team. When Usman discovers that Bayu has been practising football, he pressures his grandson to quit. Bayu does not, and eventually Usman relents. Eventually Bayu is accepted as a member of the national squad, whom he helps win a tournament.
