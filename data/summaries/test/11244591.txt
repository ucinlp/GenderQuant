{{Plot}} Mammy Two Shoes  is sweeping the floor and Tom relaxing near Jerry's mouse hole. Tom raises his feet to let Mammy sweep under him, while Jerry is undisturbed as he comes out of his mouse hole and returns with a piece of cheese. As the mouse returns home, Mammy points him out to Tom, but the cat takes simply one glance before returning to sleep. The mailman rings the doorbell. She eagerly goes to answer the door, and receives a package. Mammy has been expecting this particular package, as she opens it to reveal Mechano, a talented robotic cat. Mammy calls Tom over to show him Mechano, using this as an official opportunity to downsize him after his laziness. In disbelief, both Tom and Jerry laugh out loud. To silence the cat, Mammy then turns on Mechano with the remote control, and it immediately darts to the mouse, hits him with a hammer, and slingshots him out through the window. Mammy then laughs, while, the sad, helpless and unwanted cat packs up and leaves the house. Mammy prides the "new-fangled" piece of machinery on its job and, as she flounces triumphantly out of the room. Jerry tries to get back into his hole in defiance, using various disguises to elude the computerized cat. First, the mouse sneaks through the mail slot with a letter for cover, but Mechano is still able to detect him. Jerry outruns him all the way to his hole, but Mechano hits him with a tennis racquet just in time. The machine hits Jerry again to bounce him into the air and then lobs him out through the window. Next, Jerry tries to sneak in through a garden hose, but Mechano chops the hose with an ax just in front of the mouse. Jerry tries to inconspicuously slip backwards through the hose and is cut off in that direction as well. Mechano continues to chop at the hose as Jerry turns around again, and Jerry is only left with a small section of hose such that he crawls like a worm. The mouse tries to crawl underneath the door slot and only does so in time to avoid getting chopped in half. To avoid being so conspicuous, Jerry slingshots himself from the front yard towards his mouse hole, but Mechano catches him with a baseball glove. The mechno-cat then loads Jerry into a cannon and uses the mouse's tail as a fuse, who is shot out of the window. Knowing he cannot win by himself, Jerry inserts a series of clockwork mice under the door slot to create a diversion army for Mechano. Everything quickly goes as planned: Mechano starts to attack the mice and the house as soon as it detects them. The machine chops up the piano with an axe, breaks the china with his cannon, saws a table with a buzzsaw, and launches dynamite into a mouse hole causing serious wreckage to the house. Mammy hears all of this, sees Mechano chopping into the floor after one of the mice, and yells at Mechano to stop. However, the computer will only respond to the controller, so nothing happens. Mammy runs around screaming for Tom's help and is quickly heard by him. Mammy runs away from the assault as Mechano tries to break through wardrobes and doors to chase the "mice" and ends up breaking himself to pieces. Mechano's computer hub, unfortunately, gets accidentally swallowed by Tom just before the maid reaches him. Mammy, with great relief, welcomes the cat back into the house, grateful to have him back on mouse-catching duties. However, Jerry gets the last laugh when he turns Mechano's remote control on, causing Tom to transform into Mechano! The terrified housemaid watches helplessly and starts screaming as the mechanixed Tom activates and goes on a path of destruction.
