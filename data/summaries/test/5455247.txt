Outnumbered but determined, Wyatt Earp , his brothers Virgil  and Morgan ([[Sam Melville  and ally Doc Holliday  confront and clearly get the best of the Ike Clanton gang in a violent shootout at the O.K. Corral in the Arizona town of Tombstone. Ike , a rustler, conspires to have the Earps charged with murder and tried in a court of law. When they are cleared, Virgil runs for U.S. marshal, but is ambushed by some of Clanton's hired guns. Morgan elects to take the job in his brother's place, but he, too, is killed. Doc Holliday, a gambler who has been on the wrong side of the law himself more than once, is terminally ill with tuberculosis and is admitted into a Colorado sanitarium. Earp intends to clear out of Tombstone with what's left of his family and move to California, but changes his mind upon being appointed a federal marshal for the territory. Guns blazing, Earp and his posse ruthlessly hunt and kill various members of Clanton's gang. He rides to Mexico for a final showdown with Ike, shooting him dead. He makes one last trip to Holliday's death bed to say goodbye to his unlikely friend, then hangs up his badge and guns for good.
