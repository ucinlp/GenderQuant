Chevy Chase once again plays the reporter Irwin M. "Fletch" Fletcher, who learns that he has inherited a plantation in Louisiana. Upon arriving, Fletch's aunt's lawyer is murdered, leaving Fletch to unravel the mystery. In order to catch the real killers and clear his name, Fletch dons a series of disguises and infiltrates the congregation of television evangelist Jimmy Lee Farnsworth , who the audience is led to believe wants to gain control of Fletch's land in order to build a Christian theme park. It is subsequently revealed that, in actuality, a chemical company wants the land so it can dump its toxic waste there. Fletch Lives was filmed in Louisiana.
