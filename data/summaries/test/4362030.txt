{{Plot}} The film begins when the Spice Girls are performing their song "Too Much" at the Top of the Pops, but they become dissatisfied with the burdens of it. The sinister newspaper owner, Kevin McMaxford , is attempting to ruin the girls' reputation and even dispatches a photographer, Damien , to take pictures and tape recordings of the girls. Less threatening but more annoying is a film director, Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth , who stalks the girls along with his crew, hoping to use them as documentary subjects. At the same time, the girls' manager, Clifford , is fending off with two overeager Hollywood writers, Martin Barnfield and Graydon , who relentlessly pitch absurd plot ideas for the girls' film. Amid this, the girls must prepare for their concert at the Albert Hall, their biggest performance throughout their career. At the heart of it, the constant practices, traveling, publicity appearances, and other burdens of celebrity affect the girls on a personal level, preventing them from spending much time with their pregnant best friend, Nicola , who is due to give birth soon. Throughout their busy schedule, the girls attempt to ask Clifford for a time off to spend with Nicola and relax, but Clifford refuses because the head of the girls' record label, the cryptic and eccentric "Chief" , would not recommend it. The stress and overwork compound, culminating in a huge argument between Clifford and the girls; the girls unexpectedly storms out on the evening before their gig at the Albert Hall the next day. Separately, the girls think back on their humble beginnings, and their struggle to the top. They reunite by chance outside the now-closed pub where they have practised during their childhood years, reconcile, and decide to take Nicola out dancing. However, Nicola goes into labour at the nightclub and is rushed to the hospital in the girls' bus. The girls decided to stay at the hospital to provide Nicola with support and refuse to perform at the Albert Hall until after Nicola has given birth. The next morning, the day of the girls' Albert Hall gig, Nicola finally gives birth to a girl. As the girls are preparing to leave the hospital for their Albert Hall gig, they bump into a doctor, but when Emma notices he has a camera, the girls realize the doctor is Damien, who runs off with the girls in hot pursuit, only to hit his head after accidentally colliding with an empty stretcher. When Damien sees the girls standing over him, he tells them that they have made him see the error of his ways, and he goes after McMaxford, who is subsequently fired in a "Jacuzzi Scandal". After noticing the girls' bus driver, Dennis  is missing, Victoria decides to drive herself. So, it becomes a race against time as Victoria drives like a maniac. While approaching to the Tower Bridge, it starts to go up to let a boat through. However, Victoria decides to drive up the bridge and over the gap, in a low-tech clip. The bus finally lands safely on the other side, but when Emma opens a trapdoor in the floor, she discovers a bomb, and the girls scream before Emma slams the trapdoor shut again. The girls finally arrive at the Albert Hall for their performance and run up the steps to the Rocky theme, but they have one more obstacle to overcome; a London policeman  charged the girls with: "dangerous driving, criminal damage, flying a bus without a license, and frightening the pigeons". Emma is pushed forward, and she tells the policeman that she and the other girls were late for their performance. Emma smiles at him, and the policeman lets the girls off. The film ends when the girls perform their song "Spice Up Your Life" at the centre stage of the Albert Hall. Footage airs during the closing credits of the supporting cast talking about the girls' film and interviewing with them. Mel C breaks the fourth wall and tells the other girls that the outgoing audience is watching them. The girls talk to the audience and discuss various things about their film, just minutes before the bomb in their bus explodes.
