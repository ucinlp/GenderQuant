Diego Simonney  is a lonely man living by the sea, once a famed film director, thence fallen into decadence and oblivion, having lost control of his movie and, subsequently, his life. Through flashbacks we're shown Simonney's crescent indifference towards the movie he is trying to make, with camera-shy, third-rate actors  and an even a worse script. He finds redemption in the love for Ana , an Uruguayan who used to be his student. But passion is extinguished, and obsession takes place as Simonney follows Ana around with his camera, stalking her and her newfound lover, a deputy. Simonney changes shapes, abandoning the film and being taken for dead . Solitude overtakes him, and he exiles himself to a bar by the sea, retconning with the beginning of the story. The final scene has Ana stepping into Simonney's bar, and after a lengthy tale of lovers lost and passion dead, they recognize each other. The ending finds Simonney abandoning his camera and being forgiven by Ana.
