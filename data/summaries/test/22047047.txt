The film takes place at an undetermined point in the future, when humanity has developed advanced robotic technology with enhanced artificial intelligence. This includes the use of cybernetic organisms  for general labor. For unknown reasons, the machines instigate a cybernetic revolt against humanity, bombing cities and sending thousands of armed, identical TR-4 cyborgs to eradicate all human life. A band of survivors, led by small-town Sheriff Reed , locates a functioning shuttle and flies to an orbiting space station in an effort to find a way to shut down the TRs remotely.
