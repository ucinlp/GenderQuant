Doug  and Robbie Smith  are a happily married couple about to retire and spend their days cruising around the world on their sailboat. But before they have the chance to leave, their good friend Judge David Roberts , asks them to care for two teenage boys he sentenced to juvenile hall. The facility is currently at capacity and instead of being sent to county jail, the judge tells the couple that the boys can help them prepare their boat for sailing day. The Smiths agree and soon take on two more boys with similar circumstances. The Smiths are soon faced with a variety of challenges from the boys ranging from their surly attitude, to a fire. Ultimately Doug and Robbie see positive changes in the four young men who are now reluctant to leave their new "family." Doug and Robbie also see changes in themselves as they rethink their sailing trip, their decision not to have children, and what their future now holds.
