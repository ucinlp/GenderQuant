It deals with Daffy the corrupt innkeeper requiring only a dime from Porky to stay at his motel initially. He then proceeds to send various animals up to disturb Porky's sleep and he makes Porky pay a certain amount of money to get rid of them, and he slowly tries to increase the fees as each new animal causes problems. It initially starts with a mouse eating celery and disrupting Porky's sleep. From there it slowly works its way up to a cat that refuses to leave the bed, a boxer dog that repeatedly punches Porky, a lion that tries to eat him, and finally to an elephant that engulfs the whole room. Eventually Porky gets tired of it and decides to leave without paying Daffy the initial fee. Daffy holds Porky's luggage, which has some explosive in it that Porky sets off shortly after Daffy walks inside the motel. Just as Porky departs, the motel explodes and has to be closed for renovation. The short ends with Daffy running out of the now-ruined motel and running away shouting in pain as his tail feathers are on fire.
