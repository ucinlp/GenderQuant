Bugs Bunny is singing "This Is My Lucky Day" when he comes on an ad in the newspaper wanted a rabbit for a show at the QTTV-TV studio. When he gets there, the producer makes Bugs climb a ladder wired to a 10,000 volt fuse box. Unbeknownst to Bugs, it is a hunting show starring Elmer Fudd called The Sportsman's Hour, sponsored by The French Fried Fresh Frozen Rabbit Company. He teaches the audience about how to hunt for a rabbit. He signals the cue for Bugs to come up out of the hole by pushing a button to activate the fuse box. When Bugs emerges, Elmer starts shooting. Bugs won't cooperate being shot at and Bugs takes this as professional jealousy, but on a scale he had never imagined. With the stage on intermission Elmer chases Bugs all over the studio. In the first room, Bugs does a Show called You Beat Your Wife  and Bugs as Groucho contests Elmer. As Bugs walks off, Elmer sees Bugs in disguise and Bugs kisses him. In the next room Elmer gets a cherry pie in his face for the show You're Asking For It . In the following room Bugs plays "Liver-ace" , and when Elmer comes in, he is playing the piano. When Bugs sees Elmer, he shows piano key like teeth, calls Elmer "his brother George", and tells Elmer to take the candelabra over to Mother. The candles are actually sticks of dynamite and blows up Elmer tattered. Next, Bugs as a studio usher sends Elmer into the show You Were There  depicting Custer's Last Stand. Elmer comes out having been attack by Native Americans. Bugs to directs Fudd to Studio C for The Medic. Finally Bugs as a producer, sends Elmer into a show called Fancy Dress Party , Elmer gets changed into a rabbit costume, and Bugs gets into Elmer's hunting outfit. Bugs goes back on The Sportsman's Hour and shoots Elmer in his rabbit suit. Bugs then comes in dressed as Ed Norton from The Honeymooners and gives Elmer a cigar with Groucho Marx's glasses and eyebrows.
