On his planet in the Otherworld, King Kai senses the destruction of an entire quadrant of the galaxy, and realises that the threat is coming for the Northern quadrant next. On Earth, Goku and Chi-Chi stand in a long queue to attend an interview at Gohan's potential new school, with Goku constantly complaining about his tight suit and his hunger. Elsewhere, Vegeta, Gohan, Krillin, Master Roshi, Bulma and Future Trunks have a picnic in a park while subjected to Krillin's awful singing. Just then, a spaceship lands and a Saiyan named Paragus steps out, greeting Vegeta as his king and requesting that he accompany him to New Vegeta to help him destroy the Legendary Super Saiyan who has been rampaging throughout the galaxy. Despite some suspicions, Vegeta goes with Paragus, along with Trunks, Master Roshi and Oolong. King Kai summons Goku to his planet, comically during the interview, and also explains about the Legendary Super Saiyan. After a huge meal, Goku uses his Instant Transmission to teleport himself to New Vegeta, where he finds Krillin and Gohan in a skirmish with some mine superintendents abusing the workers whose home planet had recently been destroyed by the Legendary Super Saiyan. Paragus offers Goku and the others shelter while Vegeta meets up with Paragus's son, Broly, and they go off together to search for the dangerous Saiyan. By night time, they have no luck and return to New Vegeta. Vegeta greets Goku with his usual rudeness, while Broly begins glaring uncontrollably at Goku, even powering up. Goku also powers up, but Paragus raises his hand and Broly immediately calms down. Paragus takes the mind-controlling device he used to calm Broly to his scientist, who claims that the device is working fine. It is revealed here that Broly is mentally unstable, having reduced more than one planet to smithereens during his teen years and even damaged one of Paragus's eyes. Paragus was only able to bring Broly under his control by having the mind-controlling device built and placed on Broly's head. Paragus even realises why Broly appears to dislike Goku, since they were born on the same day but Goku's constant crying kept Broly awake for days on end since they were in neighbouring pods. Indeed, later that night, Broly suddenly attacks Goku relentlessly in his sleep and the two fight brutally until Paragus shows up and manages to calm Broly down with some difficulty. But as Paragus leads his son back to the castle, Goku realizes that Broly's energy was the one he was following earlier, bringing him to a conclusion; Broly is the Legendary Super Saiyan. The next day, Vegeta prepares to leave New Vegeta with his friends when the workers see Broly and identify him as the one who destroyed their planet. As Broly sees Goku again, he begins to lose control of his rage and powers up to Super Saiyan. Resisting the mind control device, Broly finally explodes with power and transforms into a hulking behemoth, the Legendary Super Saiyan himself, and chooses Goku as his first victim. Goku and the others take on Broly at once, but have limited success, while Vegeta collapses with shock. Paragus snidely explains that it was all a ruse to get Vegeta killed by Broly, since years back, when Broly was an infant, King Vegeta discovered Broly to have a power level of 10,000 and saw him as a threat to his authority. Paragus pleaded with King Vegeta to spare the boy, but was beaten brutally and Broly was stabbed in the stomach, and both were left for dead. However, this was the same day Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta, and during the destruction, Broly regained consciousness and encased himself and Paragus in a ball of energy, which they used to escape Planet Vegeta's explosion. Since then, Paragus was fuelled with a desire for revenge on King Vegeta, who was dead, and so decided to take it out on his son. Furthermore, Paragus explains that a comet, Camori, is approaching New Vegeta and will destroy the planet and everyone on it while Paragus and Broly escape. Broly makes quick work of Goku and the others, but Goku staunchly refuses to give up. Piccolo shows up and joins the fray but is also beaten. Vegeta, however, still refuses to fight, but Piccolo forcibly takes him to the battlefield. Initially hesitant, Vegeta decides that he will not bow to anyone and joins the fight, but is quickly beaten. Noticing Broly's uncontrollable power, Paragus decides to leave New Vegeta without him, but Broly catches him in the act and crushes the Saiyan space pod with Paragus still in it, throwing it straight into Comet Camori. Now the only one left standing, Goku stands up to Broly, even as Broly pummels him constantly. Despite the others transferring their energy to him, Goku is still outmatched, until Vegeta finally abandons his pride and gives his energy to Goku as well, boosting his power substantially. In a final attack, Goku and Broly lunge toward each other. Goku manages to score a punch in Broly's stomach, the same place Broly was stabbed when he was an infant, and Broly apparently explodes from the inside. Goku uses Instant Transmission to teleport himself, his friends and the workers to Piccolo's spaceship to return to Earth before New Vegeta explodes. Goku and Gohan suddenly appear in their back garden and are greeted by Chi-Chi's usual rantings. Goku comically responds with what he was supposed to say in the interview, causing Chi-Chi to faint.
