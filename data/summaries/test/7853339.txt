Following a crash of a nuclear bomber at an American Air Force base in the English countryside, Dennis Markham , a prominent Member of Parliament and opponent of the American nuclear presence in the United Kingdom, is reported by a London paper to have been seen leaving a woman's home. When the woman is found to also be familiar with a dignitary from East Germany, his loyalty to his country is questioned, he is hounded by the media and is forced to resign. The author of the newspaper expos√©, Nick Mullen , continues his work with colleague Vernon Bayliss  who suspects that Markham is being framed for his views. When Vernon dies from a mysterious 'heart attack', Mullen suspects something deeper at work and finds evidence of a complex cover up concerning a near nuclear accident and a secret US Air Force base. With the help of Markham's secretary, Nina Beckman , Mullen continues to investigate the affair despite the best attempts of the British Government to stop him.
