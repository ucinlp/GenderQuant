The year is 1999 and Camille and Sullivan are young lovers, living in Paris. Sullivan is planning a 10-month trip to South America with his friends, and is not taking Camille with him, which makes her feel quite insecure and resentful. After his departure, he writes to Camille regularly and she marks his route on a map on her bedroom wall. After a while, Sullivan's letters become less frequent and Camille takes down the map, realising that he's probably not coming back to her. Over time, Camille gradually begins to move on with her life and starts a relationship with Lorenz, an older, Danish, lecturer at her architectural college. Camille and Sullivan meet up again, after eight years, and find that they still have feelings for each other. Although Camille realises that they have very little in common, she tells Sullivan that she still loves him and always will. While Lorenz is abroad, the two ex-lovers begin having an affair. However, Sullivan breaks up with her shortly afterwards.
