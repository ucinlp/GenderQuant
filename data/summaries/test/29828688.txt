Shirley goes to visit Dr. Wilson with Aunt Bam about her cancer and finds out that it had worsened. She asks Aunt Bam to call her children so she can tell them. Cora and Mr. Brown are at the hospital, to get Mr. Brown a check-up. Dr. Evans tells them he has to do a colonoscopy on Mr. Brown, and they find a growth that needs to be removed surgically. Meanwhile, Madea drives her car through a restaurant because they stopped serving breakfast. Shirley's children Byron, Tammy, and Kimberly arrive at the dinner. Byron arrives with his girlfriend Renee and his baby Byron Jr. Tammy arrives with her husband Harold and their two kids. Tammy and Harold fighting about directions. Kimberly arrives with her husband Calvin. Tammy and Kimberly start to fight, and Byron's ex-girlfriend Sabrina arrives. Sabrina is Byron's baby momma, and she likes calling Byron a drug dealer, since he was one when he was young and got arrested because of it, and she loudly extends his name, just to annoy him and his family. Sabrina also happens to be the manager of 'Smax', the restaurant that Madea crashed into. Everybody leaves for their own reasons and Shirley doesn't get the chance to tell them about her cancer. During the night, Byron and Renee sneak inside Shirley's house to sleep there, but Byron gets arrested by the police for back child support. Shirley goes to Kimberly's house to ask her to bail him out, but Kimberly refuses. Calvin instead helps Shirley bail him out. Aunt Bam tells Madea about the cancer and the family’s situation and Madea promises to gather all Shirley’s children for dinner that evening. She goes to Harold’s garage where Tammy works and tells her to go to the family dinner. Tammy gets called by a client, so Madea disciplines Tammy’s children for their disrespect, which puts fear into them. She then goes to Byron’s workplace, but she finds him outside, since he was fired for being late as he spent the night in jail. She proceeds to Kimberly, whom she finds her showing clients a house and she yells at her to attend the dinner. Meanwhile, Mr. Brown loses a lot of blood during his surgery and the doctor asks Cora to donate some. When she does, she finds out that she doesn't have the same blood type as him, implying that he may not be her real father. At dinner, Tammy and Kimberly have a vicious argument that leads to Tammy revealing that Kimberly is Byron’s birth mother, having had him when she 13 years old. Byron storms out of the house, angry this was kept from him. For the first time, Harold put his foot down towards Tammy and tells her to respect him more. Tammy and Harold then sort their problems out because of the way things didn't work out between the two. Harold acted weak because Tammy acted like she was the boss of him, which led their children to show no respect for their parents or anyone else. Over time, Shirley’s condition worsens greatly and she goes to the hospital; she tells Byron, Tammy, Harold, and Calvin, who arrive to see her, that she loves them all, including Kimberly who isn’t present, and she dies. After Shirley's funeral service, Madea confronts the family, saying that Shirley was a peaceful woman and she didn't want all the fighting going on. First, Madea confronts Sabrina about abusing Byron’s hard-earned money, and that she must start respecting him, especially telling her to stop using their child to make his life look miserable or she will be dealing with Madea or worse. Second, Madea confronts Byron and tells him to get a job in order go on the right path, because selling drugs will lead him to his own demise and Renee will just move on to the next man with a lot of money. Madea also wants Byron to start taking care of his baby and settle things between him and Sabrina together. Third, Madea tells everyone that Shirley didn't want her children to know that Kimberly was raped by an uncle when she was 12, which is why she became so hostile and aggressive towards everyone, because she didn't forgive the man that raped her. Kimberly sorts her issues with Calvin, feeling that she doesn't know how to begin, and finally hugs him and apologizes. Byron breaks up with Renee, because he just buried his mother while Renee only thinks about herself. He later forgives Kimberly . The film ends with Madea, Mr. Brown, and Cora on The Maury Povich Show to find out if Mr. Brown is in fact Cora's father. Madea says he is, but it turns out he's not. This surprises Madea who runs off-stage, sobbing hysterically .
