The rebels want the "Dutchman"  to rob a train carrying $500,000 in gold on behalf of Victoriano Huerta to finance the Mexican Revolution. So the Dutchman enlists four other men, a strong man , an acrobat , an explosives specialist  and a samurai , promising to reward each one a thousand dollars. Their first undertaking is to save the rebel leader from being executed. After thwarting the execution and having caused a riot in the village, the five men are forced to flee, along with all the civilians in order to prevent reprisals. Nevertheless, some soldiers still manage to find them and bring them to the local Mexican Army commandant. They manage to escape, killing the soldiers and dynamiting the fort's magazine. A squad of soldiers manage to pick up their trail. All seems lost when suddenly, in a gorge, dozens of revolutionaries cover the escape of the five men. The few revolutionaries are vastly outnumbered, but this serves to make the five men understand how important the success of their business. The train is heavily defended by a cannon, machine guns and dozens of soldiers. The difficult robbery succeeds. The men all believed however that the Dutchman would not really give the gold to the revolutionaries but divide it evenly between them. The Dutchman wants to respect the agreement, though, having his personal reasons. In the final showdown, the Five Man Army kills all soldiers and the Mexicans arrive to celebrate the men as heroes.
