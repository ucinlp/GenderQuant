It's in the middle of the summer. Sickan, Ragnar and Dynamit- Harry, or the Jönsson League as they call themselves, has nothing to do until the circus comes to town. Sickan quickly thinks out a plan on how they're going to get tickets. However, after they've got their hands on the tickets, the three friends arch enemy, Junior Wall- Enberg, son of the city's mayor Vigor Wall- Enberg, steals the tickets. The Jönsson League goes to Junior's house during night to get the tickets back, but they're not the only ones sneaking around the mayor's house. Three members of the circus, the human cannonball, the sword swallower, and the clown, are actually criminals and are at the house to steal the families paintings. The police arrives to the house after an alarm is triggered, and they find The Jönsson League hiding, while the circus members escape with the paintings. The Jönsson League becomes the main suspect of the stolen paintings, so they dress up as girls and go to the circus to get the paintings back.
