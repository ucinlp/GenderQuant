Kongo lives in Brussels, in the « Matongé » district on which he is writing a book. His editor wants a kind of traveller’s book spiced with ethnic ingredients. However, the writer is inspired by the vision of the complex and tormented souls that he meets anywhere, night and day. Kongo Congo follows invisible threads connected to Congolese history and its ghosts. How is it possible to hold on in this chaotic history? By having «juju», selfconfidence, and Beatrice’s love.
