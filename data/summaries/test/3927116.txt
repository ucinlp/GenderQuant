One year after graduation, New York lawyer James "Brick" Davis  has no clients. His friend Eddie Buchanan  tries to recruit him as a federal agent or "G Man" , but Davis is not interested. However, when Buchanan is killed while trying to arrest a gangster, Davis changes his mind, determined to bring the killer to justice. He bids farewell to his mentor, "Mac" MacKay , a gang boss who financed his education to keep Davis on the right side of the law. He bids farwell to Jean Morgan , the star of MacKay's nightclub who has feelings for Davis. Davis travels to Washington, D.C. to begin his training. A mutual dislike forms immediately between him and his instructor, Jeff McCord ([[Robert Armstrong . However, Davis is attracted to McCord's sister Kay . Meanwhile, MacKay retires and buys a resort lodge out in the woods of Wisconsin. His men, free of his restraint, embark on a crime spree. Hamstrung by existing laws , the head of the G-Men pleads for new laws to empower his beleaguered men. They are enacted with great speed. Davis identifies one of the perpetrators, Danny Leggett , by his superstition of always wearing a gardenia. Not having completed his training, he can only give agent Hugh Farrell  tips on Leggett's habits. Farrell tracks down and arrests his quarry, but he and some of his men are gunned down, and Leggett escapes. McCord is put in charge of the manhunt and given his choice of five agents. He picks Davis, a decision that later pays dividends when Davis pushes him out the way and takes a bullet meant for him. Davis ends up in the hospital  for his shoulder wound. When Jean is brought in for questioning, Davis learns she is now married to Collins , one of the crooks. She inadvertently lets slip that the gang is hiding out at MacKay's lodge . In the ensuing wild shootout, Davis kills MacKay, who was being used as a human shield. Before he dies, MacKay forgives his distraught friend. Only Collins gets away. He kidnaps Kay to use as a hostage. Jean finds out where he is hiding and telephones Davis, only to be killed in cold blood by her husband. Davis sneaks inside and rescues Kay. Collins is shot to death by McCord as he tries to drive away.
