Homicidal criminal "Red" Kluger busts out of jail, and kidnaps three people who were responsible for his incarceration. The hostages include detective Ray Williams, district attorney Barker MacDonald, and nightclub singer Carol. Kluger makes no secret of his plans to kill Williams and MacDonald once he's made a getaway. He has other plans for Grey, however, and for a while it seems as though she'll willingly play along with him.
