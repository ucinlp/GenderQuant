Marge Simpson drops off Maggie at the Ayn Rand School for Tots, where she goes through a very complicated security system. Then a guard carries her past the "Room for Gifted Babies" and puts her in the "Nothing Special" dreary corner instead. The playtime items are either taken away or eaten by the other babies. A butterfly then makes its way into the room as Maggie's nemesis, Baby Gerald, squashes it with a mallet and draws a square around it, as if it is his artwork. A second butterfly also meets the same fate. Maggie finds a caterpillar and a pop-up book about the life cycle of the butterfly entitled Goodnight Cocoon: Not Really a Poem, Not Really a Book. Realizing that the caterpillar could also meet the fate of the first two butterflies, she tries to protect it from Gerald. The caterpillar later encases itself in a chrysalis and starts to transform. Once the newly-formed butterfly emerges, Maggie tries to help it fly out of the window, but Gerald kills it by shutting the blinds on it as it attempts to pass through. Maggie cries in horror as she falls to the floor, while the gifted baby chamber orchestra dramatically performs "Vesti la giubba" in the background. Marge then arrives to pick her up, when it is revealed Maggie's crying was only a ruse to cover the truth: she had slipped her hair bow onto the windowsill and wore the butterfly on her forehead in its place. She then sets the butterfly free as Marge drives her home.
