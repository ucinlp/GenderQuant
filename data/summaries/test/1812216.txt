The film follows the adventures of Fuel Survey Underlord Beldar Clorhone  and his wife Prymaat   as they try to adapt into American society and pursue the immigrant's American dream. Their spacecraft was part of an advance scouting mission for an invasion, but was shot down by an F-16 fighter-interceptor of the New Jersey Air National Guard, stranding them on Earth. They live with secret identities while INS agent Gorman Seedling  tracks them incessantly over the years. The Conehead family moves to Paramus, New Jersey and blends in, taking up activities that represent the American Dream. They also raise their teenage daughter, Connie,  who has recently started dating. At the end of the movie, Beldar, who has grown fond of Earth, tricks his people into thinking that humans are armed with dangerous weapons that have killed him and so the Conehead space fleet retreats, leaving Earth unscathed. Beldar finally negotiates a Green Card from Seedling.
