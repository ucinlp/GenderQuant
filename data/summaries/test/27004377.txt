The film begins on August 23, 1992 with a team of storm trackers tracking Hurricane Andrew over the Atlantic Ocean. While flying a plane through the hurricane, their generator malfunctions, and they lose contact with it. While trying to fix this problem, a lightning bolt hits the plane causing all systems to fail, and the plane crashes into the Atlantic Ocean. Shortly after this, a group of storm trackers realize that the category 5 hurricane is heading straight for their weather station in Miami, and are forced to evacuate. The film skips forward to present day, where meteorologist Dr. Ron Young is teaching a class of college students at the University of Miami about hurricanes. After the class is over, he and his older brother are working on a device called "Maytag", that will enable them to control a storms direction. While Young is at his lab, Tom Holt who works for Zepher Weather Dynamics, explains to him that his company is fascinated with his "storm-moving" abilities. He gives Young a job as a storm tracker at Zepher Weather Dynamics in Hollywood, California. At the weather center, Young meets General Roberts, and scientist Dr. Platt, who explain to Young that they have created a device similar to the "Maytag", known as "the Ion Generator". Roberts explains that they plan to use the device to move storms into Mexico where it will bring much needed rainfall. Meanwhile, Roberts is tracking Hurricane Elizabeth in the Pacific Ocean, which is heading toward Los Angeles. A group of the storm chasers including the pilot, "Dr. Platt", fail their mission when Platt is shot and killed on the airplane by one of the other storm trackers on board. Seeking revenge on the man who killed Platt, another storm tracker on board the airplane ignites the trail of blood from Platt using a cigarette lighter, which causes the plane to explode. Following the failed mission, Roberts requests that Holt, Young, and pilot major Tanya Goodman, to fly into the hurricane and redirect it toward Mexico. During this, Los Angeles is being evacuated due to the predicted landfall of Hurricane Elizabeth. After hearing about this, Andrea Mackintire, a reporter from KLAZ, as well as several other reporters decide to go out in the storm to cover the hurricane, which is now a massive category 5 hurricane with winds over 400&nbsp;mph, and they barely make it back to headquarters alive. Back on the plane, Young attempts to send the hurricane out to sea. Holt refuses to allow this, and threatens to shoot Young, before Young throws Holt off the plane causing him to fall to his death. After this, Goodman reveals that she was on Holt's side, planning to send the hurricane back to Mexico. She threatens to shoot Young, and forces him to send the hurricane back to Mexico, however this attempt fails as the plane collides with the generator, causing the plane to explode, and killing Tanya. However Young is able to escape by parachuting back to Earth. Young then meets up with Mackintire, where they decide to do meteorology together on KLAZ.
