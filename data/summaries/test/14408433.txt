Neera Singh  & Karan Singh  are a couple living in London. Neera works in a small company, while Karan is at a big position in an advertising company. Neera is living in a bliss, until she eavesdrops a phone call of her husband. That phone call raises a suspicion in Neera's mind. Neera's fears are confirmed & she tracks down the woman's residence. But when a man opens the door, Neera is unsure of what to do. She tells the man that she came on a wrong address & leaves. The man is Ashwin Mehta , a painter, an artist having a personal studio. Ashwin is the husband of Sakhi , the woman with whom Karan is having an affair. Ashwin sees Sakhi with Karan & secretly follows them to a hotel. Neera is already present there & gives him evidence of the extramarital affair. But Neera leaves Ashwin in a huff when she sees that he is apparently not angry over the situation. However, they meet each other again. The duo approach a rapport & Neera even decides to pose for him. Slowly Ashwin & Neera shed their inhibitions. They start getting attracted to each other & even end up having sex. Their guilt is only assuaged by the fact that they are getting back at their cheating spouses. Neera even lets Ashwin draw a nude of her. All this time, both Sakhi & Karan are unaware of it. However, when Neera says that she hopes Ashwin becomes a big artist & even more successful than Karan, Ashwin flares up & tells her that Karan's only achievement is that he is sleeping with Sakhi. Since Ashwin is doing the same thing with Neera, he has already settled a score. Hurt by those words, Neera leaves him. The contact between Ashwin & Neera breaks. One day, Neera comes to break off with him, saying that their relationship cannot go anywhere & has to end some day. A heartbroken Ashwin comes home, only to find Sakhi waiting for him. Sakhi seems very happy. She shows Ashwin the nude of Neera & tells him that she liked the painting. Sakhi, who has no idea of the story behind the painting, has suddenly warmed up to the idea of having a baby. Ashwin decides to give a second chance to his marital life. One day, Neera & Karan are walking by an exhibition where Karan is surprised sees Neera's nude that was made by Ashwin. Neera calmly walks in into the exhibition & faces a pregnant Sakhi shown standing by the painting. Sakhi recognizes Neera & understands the situation. Both Karan & Sakhi are shocked to see each other. Ashwin & Sakhi continue living happily, while Neera calls it quits with Karan & moves out of Karan's home.
