{{Expand section}} Happily Ever After dissects the viability of fidelity via the story of three buddies and their tumultuous relationships with the opposite sex. The film opens with the central characters, Vincent  and Gabrielle  capriciously flirting in a bar. Vincent appears to win the affection of Gabrielle over many other potential courters, but the entire exercise is a ruse; they are actually married with a child. The rest of the film explores the nature of romance, marriage, happiness, expectations in life, how love and sex interrelate, and ultimately, why no one can feel fulfilled.
