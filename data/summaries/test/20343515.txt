In the year 2015, spaceship IC-1 travels toward a planet similar to Earth to explore the possibility that the population problem on Earth can eventually be solved there. IC-1 's crew consists of Capt. Mead Ralston , his wife Jan , Drs. Steven  and Helen Thomas , two other married couples, and four people in suspended animation. Helen is found to have an incurable pancreatic infection, but Ralston refuses to turn back; and when he denies her permission to have another child, she commits suicidehttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059744/. Steven and the other crew members mutiny and imprison Captain Ralston, but they are forced to succumb to Ralston when he threatens to destroy the ship. Ralston plans to execute Steven. Ignoring the warnings of the crew, he releases one of the "animates" by raising the temperature of the compartment in which it is suspended, and the "animate" kills him before dying. The ship goes on under Steven's leadershiphttp://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=563262.
