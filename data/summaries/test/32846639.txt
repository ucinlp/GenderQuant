A biologist, Guillermo  returns to his native Spain after discovering a plant growing in the Antarctic ice. The signs are that he is ready to give up his planet-saving cause. He contacts his wildlife-photographer brother, Alejandro , who lives in a woodland hut with an enthusiastic young Californian, Vincent , both hoping that the bears that once inhabited this area of Spain will eventually return. Nearby to the woodland hut is Natalia , a widow and mother of Daniela . Vincent also meets the schoolteacher, Rosa , who he quickly falls for. Guillermo is forced to move into the woodland hut after he is kicked out of the home he shared with his foster mother, Josephine . Tensions between the two brothers reach boiling point, as Alejandro's idealistic perspective is in sharp contrast with his jaded brother, Guillermo.What's a Bear For? Variety. 5 April 2011
