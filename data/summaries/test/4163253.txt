Kong is a deaf-mute gunman, an assassin for hire who can neither hear his gunshots nor the people pleading with him not to kill them. He receives his contracts through Aom, a hostess at a Bangkok go-go bar. Kong lost his hearing when he was a child. Because of his disability, he was taunted by other children and grows up into an angry young man. At a target range, he finds he has a knack for target shooting when he visualizes the faces of the boys that taunted him in the target. His deafness gives him an edge in shooting, as he doesn't react to the gunshots and can better focus on his target. He eventually gets a job as a janitor at the range. One day while cleaning up, a customer named Joe is in the Bangkok forest with his girlfriend, Aom. Jo notices Kong watching them. He then offers the pistol to Kong, who impresses Jo and Aom with his pinpoint shooting. Joe then takes Kong under his wing and teaches him how to shoot. When Jo injures his gun hand in a battle, Kong is ready to take on more work. Working for a mob boss, Kong is sent on a job to Hong Kong. He shoots his target while riding on the Hong Kong subway. When Kong returns to Bangkok, he catches a cold and needs medicine, so he stops at a pharmacy and meets Fon, a pretty pharmacist. With Fon, friendship grows into something deeper. This changes Kong's perspective on life as he realizes that life can be meaningful, even for a deaf-mute assassin like him. Aom has trouble with one of the mob boss' henchmen. She spurns him but he rapes her. Enraged, Joe takes matters into his own hands, killing the henchman, which brings the mob's wrath down on Joe, which in turn leads to more revenge killing by Kong, and a final big shoot-out in a water bottling plant.
