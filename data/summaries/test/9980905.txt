After Kevin , a high school senior, gets dumped by his girlfriend Gina  for being too boring, he does not want to go to the freshman orientation weekend at Fieldmont University, where they had planned to go together. But his best friends Carter  and Morris  convince him that the weekend away will help get his mind off her. Once they are there, one of the rowdiest fraternities and sororities on campus pretends to recruit them as pledges in return for granting them access to the college party scene. Though forced to put up with the disgusting antics of fraternity brothers Teague , Bearcat , and Cooper , the guys meet sorority girls Kendall , Heather , and Amy , and sparks fly. But once Teague feels threatened by Kevin's new relationship with Kendall, he takes the pre-frosh humiliation to a greater level, forcing the guys to decide to fight back. They get Teague arrested, Bearcat stuck to a toilet by putting glue on the seat, and tape Cooper the school statue, like they did to Kevin earlier in the film. The guys reconilce with the girls, then head back home. Back at their school Gina wants to get back together with Kevin, but he rejects her. The film ends with the guys talking about going to the freshmen orientation at another college.
