Willful Winnie Slade  purchases the home of kindly Prof. Billings  with a view to turning it into a hotel, not knowing that the scientist has been working in the basement to create a race of superbeings to help the war effort and intends to use prospective guests in his experiments--unfortunately so, given that his work has seemingly killed a number of test subjects already. Peter Lorre plays the town mayor/sheriff/hair tonic salesman Dr. Lorentz, who becomes involved in the professor's work when he sees the potential for profit, while Larry Parks is Winnie's long-suffering love interest, Bill.
