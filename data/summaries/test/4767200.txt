Elizabeth "Lizzie" Wurtzel is a teenager accepted into Harvard with a scholarship in journalism. She has been raised by her divorced mother since she was two years old, but she misses her father and feels needy and depressed. When she joins the university, she lives with a roommate Ruby and loses her virginity to a man called Noah. Her article for the local column in The Harvard Crimson is awarded by Rolling Stone. Lizzie abuses sex and drugs as her depression worsens; in her anger and misery, she lashes out at those who love her most, ultimately making her problems worse. Her mother sends her to an expensive psychiatric treatment with Dr. Sterling, in spite of having difficulties paying for her medical bills and therapy sessions. After a long period of treatment under medication, and a suicide attempt, Lizzie stabilizes and adjusts to the real world.
