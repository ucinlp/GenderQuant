{{Plot}} The story begins with a jump, the suicide of Eon-Joo, off of the Catholic girls' high school she attends. Her sister Jeong-Eon sees her jump. The next day we see Jeong-Eon, So-Hee, Yoo-jin, and Joo-yeon in the office of the school, each swearing that they were meeting Joo-yeon in the meeting room, and that Eon-Joo wandered off to go to the restroom, then jumped off the roof of the school. So-Hee is the only student to admit she was on the roof when Eon-Joo jumped. Each of the three girls become very paranoid about the death of Eon-Joo, and secrets about why each girl had a reason to jump start to surface. We see that So-Hee is beginning to become very depressed about the death, unlike the other two. During the funeral of Eon-Joo we see So-Hee leaving the funeral crying. Jeong-Eon catches So-Hee before she leaves, confronting her about the death of Eon-Joo. So-Hee repeats that she doesn't know what happened and leaves. Meanwhile, rumors start to spread around the school. Many girls accuse So-Hee of killing Eon-Joo, since their relationship had become strained from the past year. Another girl claims that Eon-Joo killed herself because she was pregnant. In the next scene the three girls are seen in a corner of the school, accusing each other of spreading rumors, which each girl denies. Joo-yeon screams, claiming she saw Eon-Joo watching them. That evening Joo-yeon is lying awake in bed terrified, and her father comes in and beats her for having low grades. The next day she attends school with an eye patch over her left eye. Later, Joo-yeon is in the bathroom speaking to two girls who are gossiping about Eon-Joo's death. Joo-yeon sees Eon-Joo standing in an open bathroom stall, the left side of her face bloody and cracked. Joo-yeon runs to Yoo-jin while in class and screams that she has seen Eon-Joo in the bathroom. While Yoo-jin comforts her, Joo-yeon sees Eon-Joo again outside the window, screams, and wets herself. After a small fight Joo-yeon grabs her stuff, claiming to go to the teacher. Yoo-jin locks up Joo-yeon claiming she knows too much, and goes to computer class. Joo-yeon is screaming for Yoo-jin, when she sees someone outside the door. It turns out to be Eon-Joo, and she screams. We then see Yoo-jin in the computer room. The screens go black and Yoo-jin's screen shows Eon-Joo standing over Joo-yeon, who is curled up. Yoo-jin goes to rescue Joo-yeon and finds her in the bathroom, washing the urine off of her leg. Yoo-jin asks who let Joo-yeon out and she tells her Eon-Joo let her out, and Eon-Joo promised to not kill any of them if they come clean. Later Joo-yeon jumps off the roof. Yoo-jin and So-Hee watch her jump, both begging her not to jump. So-Hee is then seen holding Joo-yeon. So-Hee is asked by the faculty what happened, but So-Hee cannot speak. Later on So-Hee begs Yoo-jin to let her confess. Yoo-jin storms out of the classroom, and So-Hee stays behind seeing Eon-Joo. Eon-Joo turns So-Hee's head around to look at her and So-Hee screams. Yoo-jin runs back to check on So-Hee, and then asks her to go to the church to attempt to apologize. Before going to the church Yoo-jin attempts to take the church key that used to belong to her before Eon-Joo beat her in grades. Jeong-Eon asks Yoo-jin if she is "looking for this" and holds up the key. Jeong-Eon tells Yoo-jin that she knows that she was up on the roof when Eon-Joo was there. Yoo-jin asks why she knows that, and Jeong-Eon responds "Eon-Joo told me, she told me everything!" Yoo-jin hits Jeong-Eon with a statue and leaves, but we see that Jeong-Eon was just knocked out. Inside the church, So-Hee enters the confession box, and Yoo-jin pretends to enter hers. However, Yoo-jin goes into So-Hee's box attempts to strangle So-Hee. She smiles and says "Do you want to know why we asked you to kill yourself with us?" A flashback shows So-Hee with her boyfriend, Ki-Ho. We are shown that Yoo-jin used to date Ki-Ho and immediately made So-Hee and Joo-yeon stop being friends with Eon-Joo, despite So-Hee being such great friends with Eon-Joo. Eon-Joo had even told So-Hee that she wanted to die together with So-Hee one day, and regardless of this, she was no longer allowed to talk to Eon-Joo. However, on the day of So-Heeâ€™s suicide, So-Hee called Eon-Joo to the library and told her that she was sorry for everything and confessed her pregnancy. So-Hee swore that she was going to kill herself and take the baby with her, and Eon-Joo agreed to die along with So-Hee no matter what. We then flash ahead to see Yoo-Jin pacing in the church, claiming to So-Hee and Joo-yeon that she would kill herself if she didn't make top grades. Not because she was terrified of losing the key, but losing to somebody in general. Joo-yeon sits up and says "Suicide isn't funny. I tried to kill myself last year because of my dad." So-Hee then confesses her pregnancy. Later we see Joo-yeon and Yoo-jin in a bedroom. Yoo-jin suggests that because So-Hee is better at school work than Yoo-jin, she doesn't want to lose to So-Hee again. Yoo-jin and Joo-yeon decide that they would pretend to jump. Yoo-jin drags So-Hee to the front of the church, tying a microphone around So-Hee's neck and stringing her high up. Just then a girl storms in screaming Yoo-jin's name. Yoo-jin asks "Which one are you? Joo-yeon or Eon-Joo?" It turns out to be Eon-Joo, who chases Yoo-jin to the back of the church; Eon-Joo catches her, and strangles Yoo-jin. Eon-Joo steps forward to So-Hee, while So-Hee screams. We then see a flashback of the four girls on the roof, each girl holding hands. Before the jump, Joo-yeon and Yoo-jin step back, accidentally pulling So-Hee with, but So-Hee accidentally let go of Eon-Joo's hand, and she Eon-Joo fell to her death. The next scene is of So-Hee crying and hugging Eon-Joo on the roof. Eon-Joo just smiles and says she missed So-Hee so much, and that she wanted to return, but knew she would scare So-Hee. Eon-Joo tells So-Hee she can no longer return while So-Hee begs Eon-Joo to take her with her. However, Jeong-Eon grabs Eon-Joo's hand, and Eon-Joo tells So-Hee that she must stay to take care of Jeong-Eon and that So-Hee is now Jeong-Eon's older sister. In the final scene we see that So-Hee is keeping the baby and Ki-Ho has moved on with a short-haired girl. The two step into an elevator, and as the door is closing, we see the girl's face turn into Eon-Joo's.
