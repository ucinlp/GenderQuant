In a run-down neighborhood, Frank Castle wakes up and exits his van to get his laundry done. On his way to the coin-op laundromat, he witnesses a street gang stop and confront three prostitutes before Goldtooth, the gang leader, takes one of them to a back alley and rapes her. Despite hearing her screams from a distance, Frank minds his business and places his laundry in a washing machine. Minutes later, a boy named DeShawn crosses through the neighborhood and is harassed by the gang while Goldtooth offers him an opportunity to sell drugs for them. When DeShawn refuses, the gang members begin to mug him. Frank walks to a liquor store across the street to get a bottle of Yoo-hoo. There, a handicapped store clerk named Big Mike tells him that two years ago, he witnessed a similar situation and wound up crippled for confronting the gang. Frank pays for the Yoo-hoo and buys a bottle of Jack Daniel's, which he uses to club the gang members. After killing the thugs, he breaks Goldtooth's right arm and legs before asking him what the difference between justice and punishment is while pouring the whiskey on him. He then pulls out a lighter and places it on the ground before returning to the laundromat. The battered prostitute returns to the scene to pick up the lighter and set the gang leader on fire as Frank walks back to his van with his laundry. DeShawn approaches him to return a t-shirt he dropped, but Frank tells him to keep it. As Frank drives off, the boy unfolds the shirt to reveal the Punisher symbol.
