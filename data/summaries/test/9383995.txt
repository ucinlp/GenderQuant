 The film tells the story of Mecha , a middle-aged woman in her 50s who has several teenagers. Her husband Gregorio  wants to remain looking young, and both of them have to deal with their gloomy Amerindian servants, whom Mecha accuses of theft and laziness. Both Mecha and Gregorio take to drinking to cope with day-to-day living. In order to avoid the hot and humid weather of the city, the family spends their summers in their rural shabby country home that they have named "La Mandragora". Mecha's cousin, Tali , lives in the nearby city of La Ci√©naga  and has a brood of small, noisy children and a husband, Rafael , who loves his family and also hunts. Before long, the crowded domestic situation in both homes strains the families' nerves, exposing repressed family mysteries, and tensions that threaten to erupt into violence. {{space}}
