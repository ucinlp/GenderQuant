This documentary is a self-discovery of a matured Mike Tyson, who reflects on his highly controversial and publicly viewed life. It begins with clips of 20-year-old Tyson's convincing World Boxing Council Heavyweight Championship win over Trevor Berbick, then explores the fighter's upbringing and motivation. It is revealed that he had a fractured family life and difficult childhood in Brownsville, Brooklyn, where his crimes led him to Tryon School for Boys in Johnstown, New York. A father-son relationship with his first professional trainer and only father figure in his life, Cus D'Amato, is expressed as Tyson chokes back tears. He reveals his vulnerability when he relates the fear that he felt when D'Amato died in 1985. Tyson was only 19 years old when he lost the one real parental figure in his life. Tyson eventually unified the WBC, WBA and IBF title championship belts, becoming the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world. This turned into a traumatic event that was the root cause of Tyson's many personal issues. Tyson makes it apparent that his great stardom at only the age of 20 was a blessing for him but also a curse. From his great achievements at such a young age to the eventual tangled web of his existence, Tyson is able to expose his contrasting flaws of mental instability, immaturity, lust for women and fear, all of which explain his downfall as a boxer and his controversial life. In the end, having fought a battle with fear in order to fight for his respect, Tyson is shocked by the outcome: a renewed respect for life and family.
