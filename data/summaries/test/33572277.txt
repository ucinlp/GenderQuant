The story involves the character Piggy, who picks up his girlfriend and takes her to a theater where a hot jazz orchestra is playing. Piggy mocks the trumpet soloist, and plays a corny chorus of the 1873 hit "Silver Threads Among the Gold" on the saxophone. The audience, led by three drunk dogs in the balcony, then mock Piggy with the title song "You Don't Know What You're Doin'". Piggy is then joined onstage by one of the drunk dogs . Piggy picks up their bottle of bootleg hootch , takes a swig, and starts having hallucinations; he pours some booze into the radiator of his automobile, which arches its back like a frightened cat and takes Piggy for a wild ride through the city.
