A group of German soldiers begins to feel safe from partisan attacks while staying in a small town, far from the mountains where the fighting is taking place. Local lads, unhappy with their elders' passive stance, organise themselves into a group and take action. They write anti-German slogans all over the town and the Germans become more alert. A prisoner escapes and the boys decide to help him. They succeed despite the dangers.summary from 2007 Festival of Slovene film site
