David Koch , a climatologist employed by Inter Sci, proposes a theory that the last ice age was triggered by Earth's polar shift in a single day. When unusually cold weather strikes Miami and the birds start to return from the south a few months earlier, he is sent to Antarctica to find out what is happening. Once there, he discovers a frozen body of a human that is at least 10,000 years old. What is interesting is his appearance—he looks as if he was instantly frozen in place. He also discovers cave paintings that show the sun falling down. A sudden blizzard then destroys a base camp and kills some members of his team. Back in Miami, he presents his findings to his co-workers and his boss. He claims that another polar shift is only a couple of hours away and the new ice age is inevitable. However, nobody believes him. According to the current theories, the shifting of the poles should last at least 200 years so the climate changes, if any, wouldn't appear overnight. David's one-time love Bryn  supports his theory with numerous stories about the falling sun followed by a darkness and terrible cold. When the weather in Miami starts getting colder and colder, the evacuation is ordered and the people start to move to the north. David, Bryn, and a group of people miss the chance to escape, and their only hope is to hide in a special room at Inter Sci. In a couple of hours, everything from 30° north and south of the equator turns to absolute zero  turning the Southern United States, Mexico, Central America, north of South America, and Africa into an ice desert. They manage to survive although everything is frozen outside the room. When the polar shift is over and the sun appears again, they are rescued. As a consequence of polar shift, many people die and the world's climate changes completely—Florida is completely frozen, Northern Canada and Siberia become hot deserts; Greenland, Iceland, Northern Europe, New York, Alaska, and Antarctica now have a tropical climate.
