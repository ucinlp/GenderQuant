Jane Morgan  is the mother of two children, Sally  and Sam , and pregnant of a third. She has been separated from her husband Bob  for a while, who is desperate to win back his wife's affection. After being five days overdue, Jane goes into labor. Everything is going well, until she is suddenly sedated by a nurse, Rita Donahue . Hours later, she regains consciousness, and the doctor informs her she went into labor prematurely and had a stillborn. Noticing the amount of drugs that was in her body after the labor, he suspects that she is abusing medicine pills, which he thinks caused the premature birth. Little does Jane know that Rita - with the help of her teenage son Patrick  - stole her baby daughter, and switched records on a stillborn and healthy child to make it appear as if Jane's baby was a stillborn. Rita faked a pregnancy for months to keep her drifting lover Frank  from leaving her. When Frank, who is married to another woman - shows his disappointment that 'their' child is not a boy, Rita responds in anger, and immediately sets out to somehow get a baby boy as well. Sometime later, she announces that she is pregnant again, and poses under the assumed name Elaine Crisp to take care of a pregnant woman who will deliver a boy. When Rita finds out that the woman knows about her true identity, she instead gives labor of a 30-year-old woman named Theresa Richland  in her home, cuts her throat, and steals her baby. Meanwhile, Jane becomes convinced that she did not suffer a miscarriage, but instead of receiving support, her relatives and best friend Sharon  believe that she is addicted to drugs and suffering from a depression, and suggest her to visit a psychiatrist. Even though she is estranging herself from everyone she knows, Jane continues to find out the truth and slowly recollects all the memories of her labor. In the hospital, she runs into Nurse Ramsey , who helped her with her labor before Rita stepped in. Ramsey admits that she remembers that her baby was alive and healthy when she last check up on her, but she is too afraid to support her theories. Therefore, Jane hires attorney Gail Huddle  to sue the hospital, only to find out her case is hopeless since her records have gone missing . Back in the hospital, Detective Knoll  suspect Rita as Theresa's killer, because Theresa's boyfriend Tom Burke  identified her as her midwife. After giving him a false alibi, she instructs Patrick over the phone to give Knoll the same story if he is questioned. Nevertheless, Knoll instructs an examination, during which her doctor concludes that she has had a hysterectomy over ten years ago and cannot give birth to children. Afterwards, Rita admits to the murder of Theresa and having stolen two babies, but refuses to tell who the first baby's mother is. Nonetheless, Knoll locates Jane, and happily reunites her with her daughter.
