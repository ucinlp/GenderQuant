Pooch operates a meat store in the city. One day, he receives an order by phone from his sweetheart, the girl coonhound, who preferred a stout chicken. Pooch then selected the right meat for the order and sets off in his horse-drawn carriage. Pooch arrives at the house of his recipient. As he comes to the door carrying a basket with the order, a mischievous pet cat takes a peek. For some reason, the cat takes the chicken from the container and runs off, prompting Pooch and the girl coonhound to go after. At the front yard of the house, Pooch grabs hold of the chicken but the cat refuses to let go. To help her boyfriend, the girl coonhound also pulled from behind. This tug-of-war lead to the dogs taking the skeleton, and the cat taking the skin, therefore ruining the order. It also resulted in Pooch trampling on the girl coonhound, knocking her unconscious. Trying to revive her, the worried Pooch poured two buckets of water on his sweetheart but to no avail. Meanwhile, the cat plans to create more mischief by attaching one end of a long rope to an automatic wringer and goes inside the house carrying the other end. Pooch was still in the front yard, not knowing what to do as the girl coonhound is still in coma. Just then, the cat came to them, pretending to regret what happened as well as encouraging Pooch to kick it in the rear. Obliged, Pooch delivers a kick, but the sneaky feline quickly puts the other end of the rope around his leg. The cat then activates the automatic wringer, and Pooch was pulled away. As he was dragged by the long string, the helpless Pooch went around beds, stair handrails, and rooftops. He was able to removed the rope from his leg at some point, only to have it back somehow. Along the way, he caught a hefty chicken. When Pooch is getting closer to the wringer, the cat, standing next to the machine, began celebrating. This enjoyment would be cut short as the feline was nabbed by Pooch's new chicken, resulting all three of them to be wringed. The girl coonhound at last regained consciousness and notices the wringer being turned on. Exiting the machine first is the cat which walks away in a flat dimension. Finally, a daze Pooch pops his head out. He also shows the chicken he caught which is now featherless. Amazed by the sight, the girl coonhound embraces and kisses him.
