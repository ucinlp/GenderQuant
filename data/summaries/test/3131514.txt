The Leningrad Cowboys, a band with foot-long quiff hairstyles and long Winklepicker shoes to match, are seeking success in Siberia, but nobody seems to like their music. Thwarted by a lack of local commercial potential, they are encouraged to move to America, for people will "buy anything" there. They depart for New York, bringing with them a band member who had frozen the previous night while practicing outside. They arrive at the CBGB bar in Manhattan. An agent offers them a gig at a wedding in Mexico and recommends that they change their musical style to rock and roll. They buy a used Cadillac, strap the coffin carrying their frozen band member onto the roof and set off to earn their way through the Deep South, adapting their musical style to suit local tastes at each new location. All the while they are being driven on and exploited by their money and food hoarding manager Vladimir , who has a seemingly unlimited supply of beer in the ice-filled coffin. Unknown to them, they are being pursued by the village idiot, Igor , who idolizes the band and has followed them from Siberia. During the trip, the band spends time in jail, has their car engine stolen, causes a nightclub to close after playing an unsuccessful show, and reunites with a long-lost cousin . They eventually make it to Mexico and their wedding gig, where the thawing bass guitarist is revived with a shot of tequila and joins the group on stage. The manager wanders off, but the band finally finds success in Mexico, making the top ten.
