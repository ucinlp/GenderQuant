"Blackie" Norton , a saloonkeeper and gambler in the notorious Barbary Coast, owns the Paradise Club on Pacific Street. He hires a promising but impoverished classically-trained singer from Benson, Colorado named Mary Blake , who becomes a star attraction at the Paradise. The Professor  can tell Mary has a professionally trained voice. Mat  feels Mary is not going to stay on the "Coast." Complications arise when she is offered an opportunity to sing in the opera. Mary is hired by the Tivoli Opera House on Market Street. She becomes involved with Nob Hill scion Jack Burley ([[Jack Holt . Meanwhile, Blackie's childhood friend, Roman Catholic Father Tim Mullen , keeps trying to reform him, while the other nightclub owners attempt to convince Norton to run for the City and County of San Francisco Board of Supervisors in order to protect their crooked interests. Norton knocks out a heckler during a speech in Golden Gate Park. Blackie wants to stop Mary singing at the Tivoli, but when he hears her, he does not stop the opera. Mary meets Burley's mother  at her Nob Hill mansion. She tells Mary that she started out as Massie, the washerwoman in 1850 on Portsmouth Square and then she married the elder Burley. Despite Father Tim's best efforts, Blackie remains a jaunty Barbary Coast atheist. However, Father Tim tells Mary that it was Blackie who paid for the new church organ. Mary returns to the Paradise and is dressed in a skimpy fashion; Father Tim takes her from the Paradise and Blackie. On order of Burley, April 17, 1906 the San Francisco Police Department padlocks the Paradise. Mary sings the song San Francisco and wins the Chicken's Ball for the Paradise; but Blackie refuses the prize money. Then, at 5:13 a.m. April 18, 1906, the earthquake hits and then the fires erupt. The water mains are broken. Mat has been taken from the destroyed Hall of Justice on Washington Street; a nurse tells Blackie Mat will not survive as Mat says he was wrong about Mary. Blackie goes to Nob Hill and sees Mrs. Burley  as the US Army troops from the Presidio prepare to blow up the mansions to create firebreaks. Father Tim takes Blackie to Golden Gate Park. Blackie sinks to his knees and finds God upon discovering that Mary survived. Men yell, "The fire's out!" and "We'll build a new San Francisco!" The people  march from Golden Gate Park, arm-in-arm, singing The Battle Hymn of the Republic, and the smoldering ruins dissolve into the "modern" San Francisco of the mid 1930's.
