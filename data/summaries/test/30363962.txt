The film starts off with a man walking into a bar. He looks tired and visibly shaken. After ordering a drink, he begins to tell the bartender about what has happened to him. His day had started off with a date with his girlfriend. While walking in the park, he gets distracted and begins to question the methods of Dora the Explorer and bumps into a car. This car turns out to be that of The Bulk, a ruthless gangster who happens to like Dora the Explorer. He then proceeds to beat up and knock out Mac. He wakes up in the middle of the night and makes it back home. However, the next day he somehow  appears in the home of The Bulk and gets thrown out again down some stairs. Mac gets up and runs away. Eventually, he stumbles upon the bar that he walked into at the beginning. In a plot twist, it turns out that the bartender is a Bulk himself, revealed by the first Bulk's appearance in the bar. As Mac once again runs for his life, he manages to bump into the same car he had bumped into the day before. When he looks up, he is horrified to see two more bulks. One of the Bulks swings a bat at Mac, leaving the movie in a cliffhanger.
