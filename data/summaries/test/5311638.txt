Dylan , a high school student with an inoperable brain tumor, lives with his widowed mother Carol  in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania. He is invited on television by a wish-granting organization and stuns viewers with his wish: he wants to spend a weekend alone with supermodel Nikki Sinclair . Living in New York City, Nikki is watching television and hears about Dylan's wish; she is convinced by her agent to see Dylan, as part of a publicity stunt to improve Nikki's image, but her visit is very brief. Dylan is disappointed and decides to raise money and travel to New York, trying to see Nikki again. Carol struggles with allowing her sick son  to be unsupervised in an unfamiliar city. Nikki has her own problems and is reluctant to even speak to Dylan. Striking out and growing sicker, Dylan and his friends take a cab back to Pennsylvania, and eventually to the hospital. Surprisingly, Nikki shows up and, at his request, takes Dylan to the beach. They spend the day together talking, fishing, and kissing, eventually falling asleep on a blanket. In the morning, Nikki discovers that Dylan has died. Nikki attends his funeral with friends and family. As he enters the afterlife, Dylan arrives on the beach to see his father, who died years before, fishing. He invites Dylan to join him. Dylan asks his father how he knows this is not a dream. His father replies, "You don't, and you never will".
