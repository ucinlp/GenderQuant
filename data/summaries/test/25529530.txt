Ann Gentry is a social worker, whose husband has been involved in a car crash, and takes up the case of the twisted and mysterious Wadsworth family, and takes a special interest in a member only called "Baby", a mentally impaired twenty-something who still acts and is treated like an infant by his mother and sisters. Ann is interested in Baby and wants to see if she can teach him to behave appropriately for his age group. The Wadsworth clan has been neglectful and abusive to Baby, but Mrs. Wadsworth has been extremely overprotective of him ever since his father left shortly after his birth, and isn't going to let another caregiver mess with her son. Eventually, Ann and her mother take Baby, and his mother and sisters come after them, but Ann and her mother kill them. We soon find out why she is so interested in Baby: so he can be a playmate for her husband, who was left with the mental capacity of an infant after his accident.
