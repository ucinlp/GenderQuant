In a closed drugstore at midnight, the characters from all of the books and magazines are coming to life. At the beginning of the film, Ted Lewis is seen playing a number, which segues into a caricature of orchestra conductor Leopold Stokowski leading the Storm movement from the William Tell Overture. After this, the title song is sung by a girl trio caricaturing the Boswell Sisters on the cover of Radioland magazine; all the while, Hugh Herbert is seen repeatedly smiling and adjusting his necktie. A bullish criminal on the cover of The Gang Magazine, distracted at the sound of the sisters' performance, sneaks about and decides to use an oil can from the cover of Popular Mechanics to break into a safe on the cover of The Magazine of Wall Street. He is discovered by detective "Cholly Jam" , and after explaining himself to the police on the cover of True Confessions, he is chased, caught, and sentenced to Life. However, he decides to escape through the cover of Liberty; but he is reported by the famous columnist and radio reporter Walter Winchell , which then leads to a wide variety of characters, including police officers, Boy Scouts, wild animals, and native Zulu tribesmen, joining the chase. The Thin Man  uses a dog from the cover of Dog World to detect the criminal on the cover of Better Babies, and the criminal gives chase on the carriage, only to be ambushed by everyone from naval officers to Greta Garbo and even Saint Nicholas. He ultimately ends up imprisoned in the bars on the cover of Twenty Thousand Years in Sing Sing, and when Herbert laughs, the criminal uses a globe from the cover of a World Almanac to hit him in the head. At iris-out, it turns out he has stolen Herbert's laugh himself.
