Oswald was canoeing down a rough river. Upon reaching his destination, which is the lake, Oswald brought out his rifle and decides to go duck hunting. The ducks, however, were quite clever, and Oswald ends up shooting a hole in his boat, thus sinking it. Fortunately, he was unintendedly brought to dry ground by a moose. While walking downhill, Oswald was being chased by a boulder. His efforts to outrun the large rock were in vain as it rammed him flat against a tree. In an attempt to restore his normal shape, Oswald dropped a smaller rock on top of him. This resulted in him having a more spherical physique, making it difficult for him to walk. As he went walking, Oswald stumbled and started tumbling on the ground. In his path, two bear cubs were drinking syrup from maple trees. The rolling rabbit ran into one of them, causing that bear to be thrown upward. The cub's fall was cushioned when the Oswald rolled back. Amazed by Oswald's bloated shape and bouncy qualities, the bears began using him as a trampoline. Not willing to share with each other, the bears started pulling Oswald from opposite sides, stretching him back to his original form. Annoyed by their antics, Oswald chased one of the bears to what looks like a tree stump. The stump turned out to be the mother of bears who then chases Oswald into a cave. Upon entering the cave, Oswald and the big bear went into a tussle. Ironically, the big bear came out with no fur on its torso and runs in embarrassment. Oswald, however, comes out wearing the big bear's fur like a jacket and celebrates with a cigar.
