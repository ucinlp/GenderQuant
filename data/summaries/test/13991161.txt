Buster is married with two children . He has built a large boat he has christened Damfino inside his home. When he finishes and decides to take it out to sea, he discovers it is too large to fit through the door. Buster enlarges the opening, but when he tows the boat out, it brushes the side and his house collapses. Buster loses his car in attempting to launch the boat. While out on the Pacific, Buster and his family are caught in a terrible storm. The boat is barely seaworthy to begin with, and he does not help matters when he nails a picture to the side of the hull, or when he drills a hole in the bottom for an outlet for the resulting leak. He radios for help, but when the navy or coast guard operator asks who it is, he answers, "Damfino." The man interprets it as "damn if I know" and dismisses the call. Taking to a dinghy, Buster and his family wash up on a deserted beach. "Where are we?" asks his wife, to which Buster replies, "Damfino."
