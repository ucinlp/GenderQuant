In Una Aventura Llamada Menudo, Menudo members are supposed to fly to Ponce, Puerto Rico for a concert. However, when their private jet becomes unavailable to fly them from San Juan to Ponce, band member Ricky Meléndez hires the services of a hot air balloon company, and during their balloon flight to the concert site, they have trouble and crash land on a beach near a mansion. Rodríguez's character, a big fan of Menudo who feels old and put aside by her young, hip nieces, lives in that mansion, along with her girls. Looking for help, the Menudo guys arrive at the house, where they are given food and a room while they try to get in contact with their group director. As the story develops, Menudo member Johnny Lozada falls in love for one of the girl residents, and Menudo members meet new friends, sing and dance their way through the story. A special appearance was made by a little known actor named Danny Concepción, now better known as Champagne DJ. He is the son of César Concepción Jr. His grandfather was a Puerto Rican legend big band director César Concepción. Danny Concepción appeared in a five-second segment with the Veteran Actress Gladys Rodríguez. Danny Concepción was a guest of John and Alice Wallace whom he was staying for a three-week vacation in the Palmas del Mar Mansion where the movie was shot. The Wallaces were offered money if they allowed to shoot the movie in their home overlooking Vieques in the Caribbean Ocean. John and Alice Wallace knew Danny Concepcion had a music and theater education and asked Mr. Trucco of Sono Film Studios to allow Danny in the film in exchange for their use of the Mansion. This is a little-known part of the story of this movie.
