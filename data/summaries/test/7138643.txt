Shy seventh grader Spencer Griffith's  life changes when a meteorite crashes into a nearby junkyard. Investigating the site, he finds a "Cybersuit", an exoskeletal-suit with AI  from another galaxy. He decides to try it on and meld's with the suit's AI, Cy. He is attacked by a Brood Warrior, a member of an insectoid race waging a war against the Cybersuit creators. The Brood Warrior wants the cybersuit so his race can analyze it. After battling the Broodwarrior , Spencer escapes, gets ejected by Cy  and abandons the suit because he's afraid of being killed or captured. After finding out that Cy was captured by the Brood Warrior, Spencer returns with the school bully Turbo . As they head to the junkyard, where Cy is about to taken offworld by the Broodwarrior, they create a plan to distract the bug long enough for Spencer to rescue Cy. Spencer gets Cy back and has to battle with the Brood Warrior. After a massive battle, Cy is defeated and severely damaged. After taking heavy damage, Cy ejects Spencer before he has to shut down. Spencer covers the suit with scrap metal to hide it from the Brood Warrior. He then takes a piece of the broken armor and continues the fight. Spencer confronts the Brood Warrior and is cornered in a junked RV. When the Broodwarrior is about to defeat Spencer, Turbo activates the car crusher the RV is sitting in. Spencer escapes and the Broodwarrior is compressed along with the RV into a solid metal cube, killing it. They return to Cy, but it appears they are too late to save him. When Spencer begins to lose hope, Cy's creators appear and quickly repair him, bringing him back to life. After Cy and Spencer say goodbye to one another, one of the aliens gives Spencer a badge for his bravery. The next day at school a now confident Spencer, with encouragement from his new friend Turbo, starts up a conversation with Michelle , the girl Spencer has had a crush on.
