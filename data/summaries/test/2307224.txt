New Orleans big band clarinetist Stan Grayson has a nightmare where he sees himself in a mirrored room killing a man. He wake ups and finds blood on himself, bruises on his neck, and a key from the dream in his hand. He goes to his brother-in-law, police detective Rene Bressard, about the problem but is dismissed. Later, the two men go on a picnic in the country with Grayson's girlfriend and sister. Grayson leads them to an empty house, the house of his dream, when it begins to rain. They are shocked to see that the house has a mirrored room just like in his dream. After itâ€™s found out that a murder did indeed take place, Grayson becomes Bressard's number one suspect. Grayson, stressed out and suicidal, protests his innocence which makes Bressard dig deeper. That leads to them finding out about a hypnotist in Grayson's building that apparently set up the band member for murder.
