The film starts out with 13-year-old Valerie  sleeping in a gazebo and a thief comes in the night and steals her earrings. When she goes to investigate, she sees a horrific man before he covers his face with a weasel mask. The next day she is swimming in a pool and is then watching the water when the thief's arms suddenly return her earrings to her. Valerie walks to her house and falls asleep. She is walking on a bank watching lesbians at play in a natural waterfall. Back at her house, over breakfast, she talks to her grandmother and asks her about when the missionaries are arriving in town. During a neighbor's wedding, Valerie sees the man from last night watching her in the crowd and her grandmother reveals that it might be a past lover. While practicing piano, Valerie receives a letter finding out that there is a church sermon for all the town's virgins. After the service, Valerie finds Eagle, who sent her the letter and stole her earrings the previous night and he claims that the man in Valerie's yard and the wedding is a monster. After this, the "monster" leads Valerie to a chamber where she is forced to watch her grandmother torture herself for the love of her ex-lover, a priest named Gracian. Eagle saves Valerie and then tells her that the monster, whose name is Weasel, is in love with her and during a conversation with Valerie's grandmother, Weasel promises to make her young again on one catch: she has to sell him the house that Valerie is destined to inherit. Eagle gives Valerie a pearl and tells her that it will keep her safe. At a picnic with Gracian, he reveals that Weasel had two kids: Valerie and Eagle. That night, while undressing in her bedroom, Gracian comes in and attempts to have sex with her and she uses the pearl to kill Gracian via hanging. After this, Valerie is transferred to the bedroom of Hedvika, her recently wedded neighbor, and her husband where her grandmother and Weasel are, waiting for Hedvika's husband to seduce her so that he  can steal some of Hedvika's blood to make Valerie's grandmother young again.
