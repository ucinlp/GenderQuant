This made for TV movie is all about a family of forest gnomes who live together in their home under a tree. The family consists of a father, mother, grandfather, older son Tor, and a set of young twins. The movie mainly concerns itself with Tor, his upcoming marriage to his fiancee Lisa, and his family's preparations for the wedding. The gnome family busies itself with decorating and preparing for the festivities, meanwhile a family of trolls plan on ruining the wedding for the gnomes. The troll family consists of a dumb troll father, a bossy mother troll who's fond of wearing a snake in her hair and smoking, her two bumbling older sons, and a young troll child affectionately called "Runt". Adding to the wedding mishaps is Tor's uncle Kostya who came all the way from Siberia to crash the wedding ceremony, he makes mischief by adding extra alcohol to Grandpa's special punch, and making some inappropriate advances to the mother of the bride. The movie also contains a handful of vignettes which use still illustrations from the original book and narration to explain some of the facts about the different sorts of gnomes, and what sorts of duties gnomes perform to help the creatures they live amongst.
