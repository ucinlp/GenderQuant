The film tells the story of Isabel Archer , an innocent young woman of independent means who is manipulated by her "friend" Madame Merle  and the devious Gilbert Osmond . The film is not faithful to the novel but caused controversy with an interpolated dream sequence in which Isabel has an erotic fantasy involving all of her suitors.
