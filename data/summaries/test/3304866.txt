Artie Sawyer  is a World War II veteran laid off factory worker who currently works as the landlord of an apartment building in New York. One night, with his wife Iris  out of town, visiting her sister, Artie heads to the town bar, where he meets a pretty young girl named Claudine  who is looking for an apartment. He brings her to the apartment intending to let her stay in room 7A, and then she begins to seduce Artie, which Artie, who's relationship with Iris is currently strained  begins falling for. However, they turn out to be a ploy, as soon her sadistic boyfriend, Vietnam veteran Billy  and his two friends and fellow ex-paratroopers Riff and Virgil arrive at the Sawyer's apartment building. It turns out the four want to use the apartment to plan a major robbery at the bank right next door to the building. They do not tell Artie about the robbery, but tell him not to worry about them and that they promise to leave as soon as possible. Artie agrees, mostly because of his fear that they will tell Iris about his minor transgression with Claudine. Later that night, Iris returns from visiting her relative, and Artie does not tell her about the night with the girl, or the people staying in room 7A. But the next day, while Billy and Claudine are at the bank planting the TNT that will blow up the safe, he decides to go into room 7A to find out what is really going on. He uncovers their plans to rob the bank. At that point, he is caught by Virgil, who holds him there until Billy and Claudine get back. Billy, furious that Artie has seen too much and did "not leave well enough alone", orders Virgil and Riff to go after Iris and bring her to 7A, they eventually capture her, and later that night, tie both of them up as they prepare for their robbery by dressing in tigerstripe camouflagued uniforms . The robbery does not go off well, and the police arrive and start shooting at the robbers, killing Virgil in the process. Billy blames Riff  for the nearly-botched robbery since the timer in the bomb did not go off on time, and hatches one last plan to escape the approaching police. He forces Riff to plant his last bomb in the elevator of the building, and unties Iris telling her that she will run down to the police and inform them of the bomb, and that Billy will blow the building and kill her husband and everyone in the building if they are not allowed to escape. As Artie, Riff, and Billy head down to the elevator, Claudine, who has shown reluctance with being part of Billy's sadistic plans, says she no longer wants part in Billy's life or his schemes. He taunts her, but lets her have her wish . In the elevator, Billy unleashes his fury at Riff for placing them in this mess, although Riff makes it clear that they're out of the mess thanks to him. Billy tells him that he is no longer entitled to the money, tells him he overstayed his welcome and then kills him with the shotgun, dumping his body in one of the floors when the elevator opens. Killing Riff makes Artie realize that one way or another, Billy is still going to kill him and blow up the building, and so he jams the elevator. Billy lets out his full sadistic anger at Artie forcing him to fix it, and also telling him of the whereabouts of the bomb. Artie goes to the panel to fix it, and then starts fighting with Billy. The fight continues until Artie grabs Billy's shotgun and uses it to shoot him in the shoulder. Billy passes out, and Artie climbs to the top of the elevator where the bomb is. With help from the police  Artie is able to disarm the bomb and save the building. The movie ends with Artie now taking classes in engineering  so he can get a better job in a few years. Most importantly, he is reconciled with Iris and their love for each other is renewed.
