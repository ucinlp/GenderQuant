When Nat sees a tabloid photo of Rosalina kissing a young Frenchman during her "around the world cruise", he becomes convinced that he’s losing her for good and goes into a funk that threatens to prevent him from finishing the movie the band is making. Desperate to snap him out of his gloom, Alex leads Nat into the wilderness, believing that surviving the perils of nature will lead Nat to discover his inner strength and regain his mojo. But with so much at stake Alex knows that failure isn’t an option, so he enlists the aid of his band mates to clandestinely stage events designed to make Nat believe he’s a wilderness hero. When it seemed that the band is not helping, they made a plan with Qaasim's cousin to be saved from a bear and be kissed by Nat. The movie includes the debut of two brand-new songs, "I Feel Alone" written by Nat Wolff and a colleague of his, Dawaun Hardy, performed by Nat and "Curious," written and performed by Nat Wolff. At the end Rosalina comes back, explains her mistakes, and they kiss and hug.
