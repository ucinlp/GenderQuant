Jimmie ([[Robert Armstrong , a shady bookie, meets Pearl , a taxi dance hall girl. He takes her out on a number of dates, pretending to be a high profile producer. Unfortunately for him, she refuses to be his girlfriend. To get his revenge, Jimmie promises to make her a Broadway star and becomes her manager. He takes her to expensive dinners and meetings with people in the top entertainment circles. Jimmie tricks Pearl into signing a contract under which most of her earnings go to him. He persuades a defunct Gilbert and Sullivan troupe to re-form, obtains an empty theatre for a night, and fills it by blackmail. They play The Mikado, which is deservedly a hit. Overwhelmed with regret over his deceit, he proposes, and she, overwhelmed with gratitude over his support, accepts.
