The Man Eaters are led by Queen . The gang's main activity is racing each other, then having a wild orgy at their clubhouse afterward. The race determines the order in which the girls get to pick a man. One of the fastest held rules of the group is that "all men are mothers" and no Man-Eater falls in love. New initiate Karen , strains these rules as the gang finds her choosing the same man, Bill , several times. The Man-Eaters test Karen's loyalty by making her drag a well beaten Bill from the back of her motorcycle. Karen's loyalty is tested again when her ex-boyfriend, Ted , urges Karen to leave the gang because of the danger presented by a rival gang of hot-rodders led by a man named Joe-Boy .
