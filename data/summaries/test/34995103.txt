Bagamoyo is a ferryboat that has provided a daily connection for the last 37 years between the city of Maputo and Catembe&nbsp;– a largely rural district of the Mozambican capital&nbsp;– carrying several hundred passengers and vehicles each day, as well as goods, from five in the morning until half past eleven at night, seven days a week. The history of the ferry is told through the journeys and the stories of people who know the Bagamoyo and depend on it for their day-to-day lives. And the bridge still doesn't exist.
