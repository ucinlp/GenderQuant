George Murray has been dating his girlfriend Jane Gardner for a while now, and is ready to propose. But Jane can’t bring herself to marry again after her first husband Doug broke her heart by cheating on her with the wedding coordinator. Desperately in love, George wishes things were different: that he had met Jane before she married Doug, making her not so jaded. After a car accident, George finds himself exactly ten years back in time, just a few days before Doug and Jane’s wedding. He goes to her work, which is at a building for the Don't Throw Away newspaper, and Jane "meets" him. George also gets revenge on a guy at work who took  Harvey's plans and caused him not to get the promotion he'd been wanting. Jane's friend, Mary Brown, knows all about Doug cheating on Jane, but she can't bring herself to tell Jane. She and George talk about it and plan to get Jane to find out about Doug and the wedding coordinator. Mary wants Jane to go with George, since she despises Doug for cheating on her best friend. At Doug and Jane's wedding, Jane figures out about Doug and dumps him for George. They run off in his car, getting chased the whole time by Doug. They get into a minor crash and George wakes up ten years into the future, from where he is. He and Jane are married and are celebrating their 10th anniversary with a renewal of their vows. Mary got married to George's friend, Harvey.
