Mi Vida Loca tells the story of young Mexican-American women in Los Angeles and the struggles they have in a life of early motherhood while being members of a street gang. Mousie  and Sad Girl  are best friends from childhood, growing up in Echo Park, a neighborhood that had a significant amount of gang activity in the 1980s and 1990s, and remaining loyal to each other. But when Sad Girl sleeps with Mousie's boyfriend  and becomes pregnant, their friendship is ruptured. As dramatic situations unfold around them, some that would turn violent, they must try to stay together as friends despite their betrayals. The film takes a rather independent look at a world where women seem to have no choice but to raise their children, involve themselves with gang activity, and survive by whatever means available.
