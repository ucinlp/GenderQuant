The Climax of the Hindi version is different from that of the Tamil. It is said that director K.Bhagyaraj altered the climax script in the last minute to suite the Hindi audience. Despite being victim of lot of criticism, the film went on to become one of Amitabh Bachchan's biggest hits of his career. The highlight is his double role of a father and son. Portraying an old man with a will power and a dashing Stern young Police Officer could be justified by none other than the mighty Amitabh Bachchan.
