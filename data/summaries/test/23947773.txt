In 1914 Czarist Russia Prince Peter Karagin is a captain of the Cossack Guards, riding home from maneuvers to an evening of wine, women and song at St. Petersburg's Cafe' Balalaika. The Balalaika's new headliner Lydia Pavlovna Marakova, blackmailed into attending the officers' party and expected to choose a “favored one,” intrigues Karagin when she makes good her escape instead. Masquerading as a poor music student, Karagin insinuating himself into Lydia's family and circle of musician friends, unaware that they are revolutionaries - or that his own orderly Nikki Poppov is courting the Marakov's maid Masha . Karagin secretly jump-starts Lydia's career at the St. Petersburg Opera as a prelude to seducing her, but falls in love instead. She recognizes his dishonorable intentions, but admits she loves him too. Their happiness ends when Lydia's brother Dimitri is killed by Cossacks led by Peter, whom Lydia recognizes; she agrees to use her opera debut as an opportunity to assassinate Peter and his father the general. But when Peter confides he is giving up his army career to marry her, Lydia makes him promise not to come or let his father come to the performance. Lydia's debut coincides with the outbreak of World War I: General Karagin, who came anyway, announces that Germany has declared war on Russia. In a dispute between the assassins General Karagin is shot and wounded. Peter finally learns of Lydia's political affiliations when police arrest her as her father's accomplice. Later, Peter has Lydia released from prison. Separated by WWI and the Russian and Bolshevik Revolutions, Peter winds up in 1920s Paris employed by his former orderly as a cabaret entertainer at the “Balalaika”. Desperately poor White Russians, wearing court dress and paste jewels, gather to celebrate the Russian Orthodox New Year as the Poppov's guests. Here Lydia finds Peter, and emerges behind him as he stands before a mirror, candle in hand, to make the traditional New Year's wish to see his "true love."
