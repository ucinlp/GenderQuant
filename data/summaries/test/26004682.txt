The documentary tells the stories of four Mennonites  living in two different communities. The colonies of El Savinal  and El Capulin are settled in the Mexican state of Chihuahua and look like typical German farming communities of the 19th Century. They were founded by Russian Mennonite Europeans, whose long history of migration took them from Russia to Canada and from there to Mexicoâ€”in search of a place where they can freely practice their religion and speak their ancient Plautdietsch language within their large families. The four protagonists are longing for their perfect world in balance between tradition and modernity: The colony of El Savinal lives in isolation and rejects any modern technology, whereas the colony of El Capulin begins to accept innovations such as electricity and cars. The more orthodox members of the community will migrate to the Bolivian rainforest.
