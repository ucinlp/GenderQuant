The thirty-nine-year-old executive Bruno Davert has been working for fifteen years in a paper company. After a merging operation with a Romanian company, he is fired in a downsizing. While unemployed for two years, Bruno loses his self-esteem and sanity and his family loses the middle-class lifestyle without cable television, Internet and regular consumption. He concludes that there is too much competition in his sector for a few job positions and decides to literally eliminate his competitors, killing those more qualified than him.
