Elvira , an attractive but insecure twenty something, joins her sisters Jimena  and Sol  at their mother's house. As they prepare to celebrate their mother Sofía's birthday, their mother —a divorced concert pianist—announces that she's fallen in love, but is interrupted by the doorbell as she describes her new partner. While she goes to get the door, the three sisters gleefully speculate about her new boyfriend. Their joy suddenly gives way to shock though when their mother returns with Eliska , and they realize that their mother is a lesbian. The girls handle the shock in different ways. Elvira confides in her shrink Mazo while Sol composes a song about her mother and her lesbian relationship for her band. While Jimena herself doesn't act out in the same way, her husband is concerned about how his mother-in-law's sexuality affects his image at work. When the girls find out that their mother has given the much younger Eliska a significant amount of money, they become suspicious of Eliska and plot to find a way to get their mother to break up with her.
