The scene opens in the duo's flat at night time. Stan complains that he has a toothache. Ollie goes to the bathroom to get him a hot-water bottle and keeps stepping on a tack which is lying around. When Stan gets the water bottle, the lid opens and the water pours out in the bed. The two of them make much noise and the landlord ([[Charlie Hall  comes in, telling them that they will have to leave first thing in the morning. The next day, Stan is in the dentist office, but is too afraid to get his tooth pulled. The dentist leaves and Ollie demonstrates how Stan should sit and not be afraid. Meanwhile, the dentist tells one of his partners that he should go to the guy who is sitting in the chair and pull his tooth out. He ended up pulling Ollie's tooth. When Stan is back in the chair, he knocks over a gas cartridge which makes everyone laugh. Stan and Ollie leave the office and go to their car, still laughing their heads off from the gas.
