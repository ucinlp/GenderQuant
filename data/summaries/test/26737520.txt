During the Chinese Civil War, a railroad factory is commissioned by the Communist army to repair a bridge. Led by a skeptical engineer who does not believe the bridge can be completed in time, the factory workers lack enthusiasm and morale. The project is galvanized, however, by the work of Liang Ruisheng , who inspires his fellow workers to complete the project for the war effort. In the process, even the engineer is converted.
