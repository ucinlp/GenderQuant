Mahendra Bhoopathi and Marthandan are rival kings. When Bhoopathi’s wife gives birth to conjoined twins, Dr. Nanjappa separates them skillfully. In a surprise attack, Marthandan and his men set fire to Bhoopathi’s fort thinking that the entire Bhoopathi clan perishes. But the good doctor has taken the babies to the safety of his house. And thereafter the elder twin Vijayan grows up in the city, while the younger twin Vikraman is brought up in the forest by the loyal Marudhu. When they are 25 years old, the doctor sends for them and introduces them to each other and makes them aware of their history. The twins swear to avenge the dastardly killing of their father, and restore the glory of their kingdom. Meanwhile Vijayan saves the beautiful Kanchana from the aging yet lust-filled Marthandan and his men. Vijayan and Kanchana fall in love in due course. Problems crop up between the brothers in the forest, as Vikraman too falls for Kanchana. And being the younger of the conjoined twins, Vikraman aches with frustrating feelings of physical desire whenever Vijayan and Kanchana are together. Not wanting to be the cause for the brothers turning against each other and in order to enable them to reach their avowed objective without further distraction, Kanchana leaves Vijayan in the forest, only to fall straight into the clutches of Marthandan. The rescue of Kanchana, and Marthandan getting his retribution form rest of the exciting tale.
