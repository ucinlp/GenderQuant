The story starts with a drunk witch, flying on a broomstick, dropping her wand which the Pink Panther discovers. He then uses it to see what it can do and then decides to help someone out with it. He sees a poor girl, dressed in rags, who wants to take part in a beauty contest to meet Pelvis Parsley . The Panther then helps her out by transforming her into a beautiful girl with a beautiful house and a car. On the way to the contest the witch arrives and takes back her wand, but crashes into a clock tower. The Pink Panther realises it is midnight, and runs back to pull the girl out, but not before her slipper falls out. A while later, Pelvis Parsley arrives and finds that the slipper fits the girl, and takes her with him. The witch, again drunk, drops her wand, and the Panther picks it up. They start fighting turning each other into a variety of objects, before the Pink Panther turns her into a female Pink Panther,slightly reluctant about the wand seeing any more use, snaps the wand into two, and flies away with her on the broomstick.
