Pete Sandidge  is the reckless pilot of a B-25 Mitchell bomber flying out of England during World War II. He is in love with Dorinda Durston , a civilian pilot ferrying planes across the Atlantic. "Nails" Kilpatrick , Pete's commanding officer, first transfers Pete and his crew to a base in Scotland and then offers him a transfer back to America to be a flying instructor. Dorinda has a feeling that Pete's "number is up" and begs him to accept. Pete agrees, but goes out on one last mission with his best friend Al Yackey  to check out a German aircraft carrier.A technical error by the writers involves the use of a German aircraft carrier. The only German aircraft carrier was the Graf Zeppelin; keel laid December 26, 1936, launched in 1938, but not completed and never put into service.Breyer 1989, p. 14. Wounded after an attack by an enemy fighter, Pete has his crew bail out before bombing the ship and crashing into the sea. Pete then finds himself walking in clouds, where he first recognizes an old friend, Dick Rumney . Suddenly becoming ill-at-ease after remembering that Dick went down with his aircraft in a fiery crash, Pete says, "either I'm dead or I'm crazy." Dick answers, "You're not crazy." Dick ushers Pete to a meeting with "The General"  who gives him an assignment. He is to be sent back to Earth, where a year has elapsed, to pass on his experience and knowledge to dilettante Ted Randall , first in flight school, then as a Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter pilot in the south Pacific. Ted's commanding officer turns out to be Al Yackey. The situation becomes complicated when Ted meets the still-grieving Dorinda. Al encourages Dorinda to give the young pilot a chance. The pair gradually fall in love; Ted proposes to her and she accepts, much to Pete's jealous dismay. When Dorinda finds out from Al that Ted has been given an extremely dangerous assignment to destroy the largest Japanese ammunition dump in the Pacific, she steals his aircraft. Pete guides her in completing the mission and returning to the base to Ted's embrace. Pete accepts what must be and walks away, his job done.
