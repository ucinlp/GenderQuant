Cantinflas is a down on his luck but affable shoe shiner that learns that his compadre dies in an accident. His spouse, Leonor  is unable to raise her child, Chavita, so she leaves the kid with Cantinflas so she can go to Guadalajara, Jalisco in order to seek help from her parents. In the first days, Cantinflas goes to work to Chapultepec and Chavita finds a big ball and almost fight with the owners of the ball. Cantinflas calms down the child promising he will bring him a new ball. In order to find a better job, Cantinflas goes to school where he tries to learn but, instead fails in love with Raquel Saavedra, an attractive teacher that works there. While he tries more jobs. First, as a shoe shiner in a night club where he got in different incidents in his first night, including an unexpected entrance to the dancers room and an accidental entrance to Ravel's Bol√©ro dance act performed by Elaine Bruce , the scene is reminiscent of his Apache dance in the 1944 film, Gran Hotel. After sabotaging the act, Cantinflas is prompted to leave the night club. Cantinflas tries to get new jobs in Acapulco where he tries everything to get some money, when accidentally Chavita leaves Cantinflas to climb La Quebrada, Cantinflas tries to rescue him, but he is stuck himself at the top of La Quebrada  and he is obliged to make a spectacular dive. His action leads him to get a job as a life saver but his incompetence to save a big woman to drown  made him to be fired in the same day. Finally, Cantinflas got enough money to raise his godson and buys him a new big ball, but Leonor came back from Guadalajara, with a husband, a better life and a new brand ball. Chavita leaves Cantinflas and he sadly sees the scene. Angrily he kicks the ball and the ball goes to Raquel's feet. Finally they got together. El bolero de Raquel satirizes the lifestyles of the rich with their bodyguards, managers etc. through scenes set in posh nightclubs. Though a relative box-office disappointment for a Cantinflas film, it still ranked among the most profitable Mexican films of the year.{{cite book}}
