 The students want reduced student bus fares, so they take to the streets and protest in support of the boleto estudiantil, or the students' ticket. At first, under Isabel Martínez de Perón's government they succeed, but their protests draw hostile attention from the military regime, led by Jorge Rafael Videla, that overthrows Peron on March 24, 1976. The "leftist agitators" are not tolerated by the new government. The film demonstrates the ensuing hostile and violent crackdown on student gatherings when police break up a school dance brandishing guns. On September 16, six students are kidnapped in the middle of the night, and the police claim ignorance about their whereabouts. This is the actual event, Night of the Pencils. Pablo , a seventh member of the group, is abducted 5 days later by the police. He learns that his friends have been brutally tortured by governmental authorities and that he will receive the same treatment. The police give him electric shocks while radio music masks his cries. He was fortunate to survive and tell their horrific story. His classmates were never found and became part of the thousands of desaparecidos, students who were kidnapped and never seen again. {{space}}
