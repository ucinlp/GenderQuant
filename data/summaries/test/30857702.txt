The Florentines are set to go to a villa that belonged to Pampinea's father to attend her wedding with Count Dzerzhinsky . Pampinea escapes to a convent to get away from everything that is going on and retain her chastity. At the convent she meets with Lorenzo who thinks Pampinea to be the most beautiful but is unaware that she is there. Pampinea kisses Lorenzo blindfolded and he falls in love with her. Pampinea sets out to the villa where she is to get married to Gerbino after he tricked her into believing that it was her father's wish to marry him. The priest marries them but then comes Count Dzerzhinsky to stop the wedding because he is the one who is supposed to marry Pampinea. Believing that Pampinea is Elissa he fights Gerbino and knocks his sword out of his hand. Then Lorenzo convinces the Count to let him fight Gerbino by the well.
