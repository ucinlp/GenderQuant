After succumbing to a drug addiction that cost him his job, almost all of his money, and his dignity, Miles Berrett , is entering his new home: a tiny cell in an old, run-down prison. Determined to get his life back on track, Miles plans to serve his time and make things right with his wife and daughter. While asleep on his bunk during his first night locked up, Miles is ripped awake by a terrifying crash. A moment later, in the dark, guards rush past his cell. Working with Anthony , the “lifer” in the cell next to him, Miles tries to determine what is going on, but this is unlike anything that has ever happened in this prison. Soon, Miles and Anthony hear gunfire. And then screaming… the horrible, sickening screams of a man being torn apart. Something bad is happening in this prison. Outside of his cell, through the darkness, Miles can hear other inmates talking, yelling – trying to figure out what is happening. A voice over a PA system instructs all of the prisoners to remain calm and quiet. “There has been a situation. It has been contained.” But Miles and Anthony know that’s a lie. Something is loose in the prison, and it’s killing the guards. And Miles is forced to ask himself a series of horrifying questions. Who is it? What is it? Can it be stopped? Can he escape from it if he can find a way out of his cell… or is he safer inside? After some time, they make a horrifying realization: There are no guards left. And yet, whatever it {{not a typo}} still out there, and it’s killing everyone, one by one. Over the course of the horrifying night, Miles discovers that the thing outside is cell is connected to him. And it’s coming. If he wants to survive the night, he MUST escape this prison. But how…?
