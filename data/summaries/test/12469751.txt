Renegade soldier Col. Ryan Beckett  is called in by the President of the United States  to save the planet from imminent destruction after a Chinese nuclear testing accidentally loosens the subterranean plates and exposes the Earth's core, which threatens to bring "Hell on Earth" in just three days. Beckett assembles a crack team to deliver and detonate not one but two nuclear bombs that must go off simultaneously in the only place on the planet in which they will do any good at stopping the movement of the platesâ€”Los Angeles. The city is evacuated in a panic, but Beckett's teen daughter  is abducted by a religious-fanatic pyromaniac and Beckett must save her before he saves the world. Meanwhile, Beckett strikes up a romance with Julie , a scientist on his team who is having a feud with her scientist father , also on the team. Little do they know that also on the squad is the evil Kellaway , who hates Beckett so much he'd let the planet blow up just to kill him. In the end Faith  manages to get her hands on a cell phone and text messages him an SOS. He and Julie head to rescue her and Beckett kills her insane kidnapper. They need to find a hole deep enough to drop the device down a few hundred feet and Faith knows of one in a subway station. They head there but meanwhile Kellaway murders the rest of the team  and comes to stop them. Beckett ends up throwing him down the shaft with the device. Beckett, Julie and Faith head outside and are shocked to find that the pilot of the team has landed a Presidential jet in the middle of the road. He was ordered to wait there for Kellaway and flies them to safety as the two devices go off destroying Los Angeles and stopping the movement of the plates just before it's too late.
