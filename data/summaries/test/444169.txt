Stella, the main character, is a rebetiko singer. Although she is in love with Miltos, a soccer player, she repeatedly rejects his marriage proposals. When Miltos finally forces her to accept the idea of marriage, Stella does not appear in church, despite Miltos repeatedly warning her that he will kill her if she doesn't marry him. Miltos kills her with a dagger at end of the film. It has been said that the story of Stella's forced marriage symbolises the forces that are constantly trying to impose their will on Greece.
