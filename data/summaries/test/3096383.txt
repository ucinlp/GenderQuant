The film recreates the ambiance of the era and invokes the hopes inspired by Kennedy through the use of actual newsreel footage of the senator intercut with dramatic sequences involving mostly fictional characters. It uses an ensemble plot device similar to that employed in the 1932 film Grand Hotel, and later used by Robert Altman in Nashville. The characters include John Casey , a retired hotel doorman who spends his days playing chess with his friend Nelson  in the lobby; Diane , who is marrying her friend William  with the hope his marital status will have him deployed to a military base in Germany rather than the battlefields of Vietnam when his tour of duty begins; Virginia Fallon , an alcoholic singer whose career is on the downswing, her put-upon husband/manager Tim , and her agent Phil ; Miriam Ebbers , a beautician who works in the hotel salon, and her husband Paul , the hotel manager, who is having an affair with switchboard operator Angela ([[Heather Graham ; food and beverage manager Daryl Timmons , whose racist attitude gets him fired; African American sous chef Edward Robinson  and Mexican American busboys José and Miguel ([[Freddy Rodriguez ; hotel coffee shop waitress Susan ; Jimmy and Cooper , campaign volunteers who are sidetracked by an acid trip they take with the help of drug dealer Fisher ; married socialites and campaign donors Samantha and Jack ; campaign manager Wade and staffer Dwayne , who is in a love interest with Angela's colleague, Patricia ; and Czechoslovak reporter Lenka Janáčková , who is determined to get an interview with Kennedy. At the end of the film, Kennedy's speech "On the Mindless Menace of Violence," delivered in 1968 to the City Club of Cleveland, Ohio, is played over a montage of the reaction of those present to the assassination. Several of the characters get wounded, such as William, Jimmy & Cooper, Samantha and Daryl. At the end of the film we are told that they all survived.Text of "On the Mindless Menace of Violence"
