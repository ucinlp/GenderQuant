Jim Carmody  is an American pilot in World War II. After crashing his plane in China, he was rescued by a local warlord, General Yang , and became his trusted adviser. However, after one of the general's soldiers kills a priest, Father O'Shea, Carmody decides to desert. He masquerades as the dead priest and manages to escape to a remote mountain village. There he meets missionaries Beryl  and David Sigman . Still posing as the priest, he falls in love with attractive mission nurse Anne Scott , who feels ashamed because she is also attracted to him. Carmody writes to the bishop, confessing that he is an impostor. Then General Yang arrives, insisting that Carmody rejoin his army or else he will burn down the village. Carmody proposes a game of dice, wagering years of service against his freedom and the safety of the villagers.
