T. F. Stockwell  steals the money and jewelry contents of safe deposit boxes of the bank he works at in Cairo. He flees south in a private plane with his young daughter Doreen  and the pilot. Brought down in the jungle during a storm, the three survive the crash but Rawlinson murders the pilot when he sees the stolen loot. Whilst exploring the surroundings, Doreen finds a gorilla  wounded and left for dead by members of a safari. Years pass when Ray Gorman  comes to the area on the fringes of the jungle where the plane crashed. Bar owner Carl Hurst  and his female associate Marie  spy on Gorman to see what he's up to. Gorman's father was head of the bank that Stockwell worked for and robbed; when Gorman's father was blamed for the theft he committed suicide. Gorman is out to recover the loot from the plane crash to clear his father's name. When Gorman saves Hurst's servant Tobo  from being murdered by another African , Tobo confides in Gorman that there is a white witch in the jungle who legend has it came from the sky. Gorman realises that this could be a reference to Stockwell's plane crash and disappearance. Tobo offers to lead Gorman to the area whilst Hurst and Marie secretly follow. The "white witch" is the grown up Doreen  living with her gorilla named Samson who protects her; her father having disappeared in the jungle.
