A man wakes up in a hospital, lying on an operating table. He has no idea where he is and cannot even remember who he is. He jumps up and runs out of the room, searching the area and trying to figure out what's going on. He escapes from several doctors and orderlies who try to sedate him and stumbles through the eerie building, owned by the Mirror Corporation. The man keeps trying to figure out where he is, what's going on, and most of all, who he is. He notices that he has a strange tattoo on his hand that says "ELI," and abruptly has a memory of a mysterious woman on a serene beach. Suddenly, doctors and security guards close in around ELI. He runs deeper into the MirrorCorp labyrinth, trying to get to the ground floor and a chance at freedom. But, when he rounds a corner and catches a glimpse of the woman from his memory, he sees a chance to find answers. Forsaking all else, he sneaks after her, desperate to uncover the truth about his identity, however sinister the answers may be.
