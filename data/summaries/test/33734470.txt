{{seealso}} The film is set in 1967 to 1968. The attractive Kamila Sakowicz  and Roman Rożek  are lovers. At first Kamila does not know that Roman is an officer in the Polish secret State Security. After some time, he invites her into his apartment. After several nights of passion Roman asks Kamila for a favor. Kamila is to approach the well-known writer and literature professor Adam Warczewski  and report on his views and contacts. Kamila selects the pseudonym Różyczka . Roman claims Warczewski is a Zionist counter-revolutionary hiding his Jewish name Wajner behind the Polish name Warczewski. Kamila is approaching the professor who invites her to his home and introduces her to classical music and the Polish exile literature. The professor is a widower and single father of a young daughter. The relationship between Kamila and Warczewskis family gets closer and the reports for the state security more detailed and interesting. Finally, the professor and Kamila become lovers. Roman continues to receive top stories, but his jealousy is as big as his professional ambition. When the Polish government stops a theatre play due to anti-Soviet propaganda, Warczewski calls a meeting of the PEN Club to protest. Kamila is the secretary of the meeting, and she forwards the minutes to the State Security with her termination of cooperation. She wants to marry the professor. Roman is desperate in his jealousy and informs Warczewski about Kamila's collaboration with the State Security. After the suppression of the riots Władysław Gomułka frames Warczewski as an example of Jewish anti-socialist elements in Polish society. The anti-Semitic mood forces 15,000 Jewish citizens to leave Poland. At the same time, however, Rożek, whose name was originally Jewish Rosen, is unmasked and released from State Security. He also has to leave the country. In a final act of jealousy, he kills the professor.
