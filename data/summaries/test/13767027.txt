The film shows the encounters and romances of several characters who seek love counsel through the eponymous late-night radio talk-show, conducted by Octavio . Octavio sets up blind dates among the characters, mainly advising Sarah , a thirty-something loner who is hooked up with Fernandez , a shy, introverted man who still lives with his father. Their relationship is chronicled through a series of episodes, involving Martínez' affair with a spiritist , Sarah's entanglement with a psychopath and a subplot involving Sarah's strong-willed but ultimately broken and suicidal friend, Tina . Sarah, worn-out after so much frustrated relationships and hopeless cases, decides to kill herself and takes an overdose of sleeping pills. Martínez arrives just in time to get her to a hospital and save her, whereupon Octavio happily announces their engagement through the radio.
