Oliver Hardy and Stan Laurel are vagabonds being chased by the police. They hide in the cellar of the mansion of a Quatermain-esque adventurer, Col. Buckshot ([[James Finlayson , who departs for a safari in South Africa. The mansion is to be rented out until his return, but the staff sneak off for a holiday, leaving the house empty. The boys are surrounded by police and have to deceive a honeymooning couple wanting to rent the house. Oliver disguises himself as Buckshot and Stan disguises himself as both butler and chambermaid. During a girl-talk scene with Thelma Todd and Stan , Stan's comments get sillier and sillier. The real Colonel returns, but Stan and Ollie escape dressed as a pantomime wildebeest on a stolen tandem bicycle.
