Rudra  is an orphan. He grows up in the graveyard. He is very innocent by nature but has a lot of strength like a demon. One day he goes into the village. But the people shun him and ask him to return to the graveyard. But a village girl Parvathi  befriend him and helps him out. The village chief  and a drug peddler use Rudra to peddle drugs. Rudra is caught in a drug peddling case and is put into prison. At this time Sathya  joins him in jail after being framed in a false case. Sathya and Rudra become very close friends and share a special bond with each other. Sathya helps Rudra with a lot of things but is unfortunately murdered by the village chief and the drug peddler and they implicate Rudra in the murder case. This enrages Rudra and he takes on the evil men and avenges Sathya's death. After that he goes back to his home - the graveyard.http://wiki.gandhadagudi.com/index.php?title=Anatharu
