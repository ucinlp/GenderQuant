During the holiday season, Bethlehem School goes under review by a stern school administrator Cal Peterson , sent to eliminate programs to save money and the school itself. Following long review, Cal decides to eliminate the music program led by music teacher Lily Waite . Cal is unaware that his teenage niece Fern , whom he has been taking care of, has been changed by the music program. At the final concert, before Lily must leave her job, the music program is saved by generous donations, and Cal sees Fern perform. There are many sub-plots, including the hijinks of Jake Peterson . With a musical back ground, this film is unique in itself, it reaches out to the viewer not only through acting but through the joy of Christmas music, showing tradition in a new light, and showing that you are only as old as you feel.
