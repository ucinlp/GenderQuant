Ron Jeremy stars in this eroticized action-thriller that has a stripper avenging her sister's death. She knows she can't do the job alone, however, so she recruits the help of a rebellious cop to settle the score. But her quest doesn't turn out to be a neat affair, as she soon realizes there's more than one enemy to fight; and they all appear to be gunning for her even as she hunts them down.
