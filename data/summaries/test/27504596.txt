Kim Si-hoo, a pawnbroker is found murdered in a remote town in a derelict building. The prime suspect, a woman suspected of being his lover, also ends up dead. The woman's daughter Lee Ji-ah later changes her name to Yoo Mi-ho when she moves in with her aunt, where she grows a flower garden. Fourteen years later, detective Jo Min-woo discovers that a homicide is related to that unsolved crime. Talking to the pawnbroker's widow and her son, Kim Yo-han, gives no clue. Then Jo Min-woo requests assistance from Han Dong-soo, who was investigating this case fourteen years ago. Detective Dong-soo remembers every fact as this unsolved case ruined his career and killed his son. Dong-soo decides to re-investigate along with Min-woo and Lee Si-yeong, an employee of Mi-ho's rich fiance. Yo-han has matured into a murderer and eliminates those who get in Mi-ho's way. He exists as Mi-ho's shadow, requiring nothing in return. Secretly they are still as close as ever while they are living out separate lives. Mi-ho knows of Yo-han's crimes but looks away from them and encourages them. It is later revealed that Yo-han killed his father after he found him molesting Ji-ah, and Ji-ah killed her mother who was pimping her out to throw suspicion off Yo-han. In the end, Yo-han kills himself to protect Ji-ah.
