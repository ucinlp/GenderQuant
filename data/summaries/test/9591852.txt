Daniel Day-Lewis stars as Fergus O'Connell, an itinerant Irish dentist, offering his services free-of-charge to the rural Argentine population. He's able to do this because of the supposedly no-strings sponsorship of a "dental consciousness" foundation. While his motorbike is being repaired, O'Connell falls in love with Estela , the garage-owner's daughter. Both lovers have prior commitment: he is married, and she is engaged. Yet, they go off together all the same. After a series of surrealistic adventures, O'Connell discovers that there's a subliminal price tag attached to his altruistic free services.
