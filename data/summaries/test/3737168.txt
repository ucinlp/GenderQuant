A parody of Westerns, it is set in the fictitious town of Stodge City . An outlaw known as The Rumpo Kid  arrives in town and quickly turns the quiet town into a base for his network of cattle rustlers and thieves, despite the limited protests of the inept Judge Burke , who is also the town's teetotaling mayor. When the inept sheriff, Albert Earp , is brought in, he is quickly dispatched by Rumpo. In Washington DC, Englishman Marshal P. Knutt , a "sanitation engineer first class", arrives in America in the hope of revolutionising the American sewage system. He accidentally walks into the office of the Commissioner, thinking it to be the Public Works Department, and is mistaken for the new US Peace Marshal for Stodge City. The Rumpo Kid hears of the new Marshal, and tries all he can to kill the Marshal without being caught, including sending out a pack of Indians, led by their Chief Big Heap ([[Charles Hawtrey  and hanging the Marshal after framing him for cattle rustling. Knutt is saved by the prowess of Annie Oakley , who has taken a liking to Knutt. Eventually, Knutt runs the Kid out of town, but once Rumpo discovers that Knutt really is a sanitary engineer and not the Peace Marshal he once thought, the Kid swears revenge, returning to Stodge City for a showdown, in an explicit parody of High Noon. By hiding beneath the manholes in the main street , Knutt kills off Rumpo's gang, but fails to capture Rumpo, who escapes with the aide of Belle , the local madam.
