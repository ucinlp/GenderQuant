Cha Hyeon Tae, a Korean-born American, was adopted with his sister to American parents. He formally appeared on a Korean television program in search of his mother. As an Alpine Skier, Hyeon Tae is approached by Bang Jung Sam who wants to recruit members for a new national Ski Jump team. The 1998 Winter Olympics were approaching. The ski coach, Bang Jung Sam had to recruit all of the members of the ski jump team to participate in this Olympics. The members were Cha Hyeon Tae, Kang Chil Goo, Choi Heung Cheol, Ma Jae Bok, and Kang Bong Goo. They had been good skiers, but were out of practice. Cha Hyeon Tae was raised in America, and trained in alpine skiing. Heung-Cheol was a waiter for a nightclub. Ma Jae Bok had a strict father, working at a meat restaurant. Kang Chil Goo and his autistic brother Kang Bong Goo live with their grandmother. All of them had to do strenuous practice to get them geared up for the qualifying match at the World Cup. They had to overcome their fear and practice by training in unusual places, such as from the top of cars, amusement park roller coasters, etc. When the World Cup began, the team was lucky enough to pass after a disqualification from a fight the night before. Qualifying was bitter sweet as the announcement for the next Olympics opted for Salt Lake City over Korea's Muju. Unfortunately, because of deep fog, Kang Chil Goo injures his leg, and becomes unable to compete. Bong Goo decides to jump as a substitute but does not make the required distance for a gold medal and nearly loses his life. Despite their loss the athletes rejoice for the fact that Bong Goo survived the jump. Nevertheless, people in Korea were proud of them and surprised with their skills.
