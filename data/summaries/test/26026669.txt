While moving in, Bud Pit accidentally knocks over a small cremation urn and is disturbed by a spirit for a while. On the other hand, he is attracted to his new, cheerful neighbour Olive. He becomes suspicious of her when he sees her roaming the streets at night, not recognising him and behaving like a completely different person. He seeks help from his mother, Mrs Bud Lung, an expert ghostbuster, who helps them unravel the mystery behind Olive. They learn that Olive is actually possessed by a female ghost who is looking for her lost son. Mrs Bud Lung promises to help the spirit reunite with her  son on the condition that she leaves Olive's body after the reunion.
