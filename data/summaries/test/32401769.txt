Apocalypse, CA is the story of John Parsons and his ill-fated friends as they prepare for certain death at the hands of a massive asteroid, sex-inducing drugs, a three-hundred foot giant, and a horde of other unfortunate problems. Mysterious radio personality and apparent part-time genie, 'Sassy Boots'  takes it upon herself to grant John Parsons  a few wishes five days before the world is to be destroyed by an asteroid. Only problem is John's wishes aren't exactly calculated, or even planned - the end result of which is a situation far worse than before. Accompanied by his brother Hank , Hank's friend Renee  and John's childhood crush Jacklyn , John and friends take the high road to Palm Springs - otherwise known as the 'epicenter' where the asteroid will first strike Earth. With a 'bite the bullet' approach, John & friends learn a little more about life and each other, all leading up to a wild climax of booze, sex, fantasy, and guns-a-blazin' desert adventure.
