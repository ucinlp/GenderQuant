Little Lacy , a big music fan, discovers a great but expensive guitar in a music shop. She's very excited by the guitar, and asks her mother, Robin , to buy it. However, her mom says "definitely no", but after that she reminiscences about the time she got an Olds Cutlass as her first car when she was younger. Her father used to say: "Whatever makes you happy, makes me happy". Maybe... in the end... she'll change her mind about Lacy's wish.
