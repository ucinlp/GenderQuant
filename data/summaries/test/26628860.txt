Her stepfather John Ed owns a half-million-acre property nearby. Crazy is upset that John Ed has blocked her inheritance and may have even murdered her mother.

Meanwhile, county recorder Snagby tries to blackmail John Ed with information Mary Little Cloud gave him, but John Ed's evil henchman Reese has him killed. Sheriff Riley once again thinks Dan is responsible. The Bartletts are taken captive by Reese and sealed inside a cave. There they renew their love.
