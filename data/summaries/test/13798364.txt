Spring lives with her father aboard a run down sail boat in the Caribbean. She has lived a simple and isolated life and has never felt desire or love until Ashton joins in with them for a zany adventure involving buried treasure. In the end no treasure is found, only a long sunken slaver. However, Spring does find love and a husband. Ashton comes aboard the Sarah Tyler for some fishing and ends up in a modern day pirates adventure. He comes from a wealthy Philadelphia family and had graduated from Harvard Law School. He falls in love with Spring and envies her simple and honest lifestyle. At the beginning of the film Spring takes a dislike to Ashton - a variation of Pride and Prejudice where boy meets girl and girl hates boy. At the end of the film she realizes she is in love and against all sense of propriety, Ashton asks Spring for her hand. While all of Hayley Mills's other films have been made available on DVD this film has never been released.
