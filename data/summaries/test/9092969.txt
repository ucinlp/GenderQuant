The whole film takes place in the nightclub of Happy MacDonald . One of the more outrageous aspects of the film is that one of the people at the nightclub is a wildly stereotypical gay "queen". Although Karloff is a villain, he plays a charming man, quite unlike most of the parts he was allowed to play at the time.
