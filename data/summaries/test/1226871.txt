Jason Stillwell  is a young karate student and Bruce Lee fanatic who trains in his father's  Los Angeles dojo. One night after a training session, the dojo is visited by members of an organized crime syndicate. After refusing to join the organization, Jason's father has his leg broken by a Russian martial artist named Ivan Kraschinsky , the hired thug of the boss. The Stillwell family relocates to Seattle, where Jason meets R.J. Madison  and they become good friends. Jason's girlfriend, Kelly, also comes to visit him. Despite this, Jason has a hard time adjusting and is constantly beaten and harassed by the local bullies. Fed up with the abuse, Jason visits the grave of Bruce Lee and beseeches him for aid. That night, Jason and his father have a heated argument which results in Mr. Stillwell destroying some of Jason's Bruce Lee memorabilia. Distraught, Jason consults with R.J., who suggests that Jason move all of his training gear into an abandoned house nearby. Exhausted from the move, Jason inadvertently falls asleep at the house, but is suddenly awakened by the ghost of Bruce Lee , who appears to Jason and begins to train him. Under Lee's tutelage, Jason goes from a below average fighter to a superior martial artist, at one point easily fending off several thugs attempting to assault his father in a parking lot. Later, an annual full contact karate tournament is held featuring teams from Seattle and New York, which Jason and his father attend. Before the contest can get underway, however, the crime syndicate interrupts and makes a wager that none of the Seattle fighters can defeat Ivan. While the first two fighters are easily dispatched by the Russian, Ivan's last opponent, Kelly's brother Ian, makes an impressive showing, forcing Ivan to resort to dirty tactics to defeat him. With her brother helplessly entangled in the ring ropes, Kelly tries to stop Ivan by hitting him with a chair, but the Russian easily disarms her and grabs her by the hair. Spurred into action, Jason charges to the ring and attacks Ivan, much to the delight of the crowd. Utilizing his advanced training, Jason is finally able to conquer his nemesis and earn the respect of his peers.
