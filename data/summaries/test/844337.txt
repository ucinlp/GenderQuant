Ryō Masuda  is a SM movies director who asks a woman he meets on a crowded street to star in one of his films. The woman, Yumi Sakata, accepts on a whim but her expressive features—in particular, her eyes—make that particular low-budget production into an unexpected hit. Ryō is attracted to her but feels there is something dangerous or evil about her and doesn't want to have anything more to do with her. However, it isn't that simple. Ryō's girlfriend, Mayumi, is a dominatrix who services a very powerful man. Mayumi's client, Mr. Okonogi, wants Yumi to work in an S&M show club he owns. Mayumi fears she may be "sacrificed" if Mr. Okonogi doesn't get want he wants and she begs Ryō to find Yumi and persuade her to go to the S&M club. Ryō finally persuades Yumi to go to the club with him and Mayumi by telling her that he loves her and that Mayumi is an ex-girlfriend from a long time ago. Yumi becomes a star dominatrix . Ryō finds himself torn between his feelings for Mayumi and Yumi's expectations. He also stands to make a considerable amount of money as Yumi's "manager" and companion. Mr. Okonogi, who defines sadism and masochism as "two sides of the same coin," and who enjoys watching as well as participating, refuses to let Mayumi retire. It appears that he has the power of life-and-death over her. One of Mayumi's female friends, Natsumi, commits suicide rather than continue working in the S&M industry. Mayumi goes to the funeral. Ryō does not.{{cite web}}<ref nameWeisser|firstYuko Mihara Weisser|title 400|yearVital Books : Asian Cult Cinema Publications|location1-889288-52-7}}
