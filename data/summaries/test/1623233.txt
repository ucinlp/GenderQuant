The door is unlocked and he wanders in. An unknown person with a candle is wandering about and a dead body is found. When confronted the mysterious person claims innocence of the murdered person. The detective asks the stranger what he has in his pockets , before the shadow of a hand is shown reaching for a doorknob. The stranger searches the body of the dead person and finds handcuffs and a gun which he takes. The detective returns from investigating the weird sound and finds the handcuffs which the stranger left on the ground. A person is seen to be crawling on the roof through shadows, who then falls through the roof. This is a woman called Nora who is revived and cries out for her father. She explains that her father went onto the roof and that they are next door in number 16. The bell tolls half past midnight and the dead body has disappeared. Three people arrive at the windswept house, Mr. Ackroyd, Rose Ackroyd  and a third person. Ben draws out the gun. Ben accidentally shoots the governor.

Sheldrake gets the diamond necklace, which he has hidden in the upper portion of a toilet. Ben causes a commotion and is locked away with Sheldrake. The two hands of Sheldrake reach out and appear to strangle Ben who is only pretending to be knocked out. More members of the gang arrive. They suggest tying up Nora and Doyle. The three thieves all have to catch a train. However, one of the "thieves" is Nora's father who locks away two of the thieves and frees Nora and Doyle. He opens the door where Ben is locked away with Sheldrake and gets into a fist fight with Sheldrake. The other man reveals himself as Sheldrake and frees the others. Nora and Forsythe are tied up again. Mrs. Ackroyd reveals herself to be able to speak and says "I'm coming back". She comes back and frees Nora and Doyle. Nora has fainted but recovers. They free Ben and Nora's father. The thieves arrive at the train yard, and board a freight train that is departing. The train says Deutsch-Englischer Fahrverkehr Ferry Service between Germany-Great Britain. The train departs with Ben aboard and he stumbles onto crates of wine. The thieves, after dispatching the conductor, go to the front of the train, shoot the fireman, and catch the Driver as he faints. Doyle commandeers a bus. Ben is revealed to have the necklace. Sheldrake discovers he doesn't have the diamond and the thieves fight each other. Barton is revealed as a detective posing as a thief. A chase scene occurs on the train as the thieves go after Barton. Barton escapes and handcuffs Mrs. Ackroyd. The bus that Forsythe is on races after the train. The thieves, realizing the train is accelerating, try and find the brakes. They turns dials helplessly and notice the bus that Doyle is on. Pushing levers and turning dials does nothing, indeed, it only makes the train go faster, leaving the thieves unable to escape. At the dock, the ferry pulls up. As Doyle watches, the train hurtles through the dock, crashes into the train currently on the ferry, and pushes it out to sea, dragging the remaining cars into the ocean. People are rescued from the water. Henry Doyle is posing as Detective Barton he tells Forsythe. But actually Forsythe is Detective Barton! Who says to Barton, you can't be Barton because I am. All of the thieves are apprehended by the police who are on the scene. Detective Barton says to Nora, what are you going to do about it? Barton says you better come along with me. Nora says where? To breakfast Barton says. Ben then reveals he has the diamond necklace. Whoever did this mixed up the names. The body that was laying on the floor was Mr. Ackroyd, but when he next appears he introduces himself as Sheldrake. The stranger is a poor man named Ben. The man who first entered the house introduces himself as something that's impossible to understand and at the end reveals himself to be Detective Barton. The girl who falls through the roof is Rose Ackroyd. The people who arrive at the door are a rich man  who doesn't introduce himself and then later claims to be Detective Barton, the woman at the door is Nora, and the last person at the door who claims to be Henry's nephew is actually a cop and his name is never spoken. The person that we meet hiding in the bathroom and stealing the necklace is Sheldrake. In case you don't understand the complex mumble jumble above I'll use the characters real names and boil down the plot to something comprehensible, sorry for the length it's a really complicated movie. Detective Barton enters a house that's for sale. Inside the house he runs into a poor squatter named Ben and what appears to be someone Ben killed. They talk for a while and try to figure out what's going on. They see someone crawling on the roof and then said person falls through the roof. The person is a girl by the name of Rose Ackroyd who calls out to her father that she sees "dead" only a few meters away. She says that she was on the roof looking for her father because she received a telegraph for him. The telegraph reads “have traced Suffulk necklace to Sheldrake – expect him to make get away tonight – watch NO 17 – will arrive later – Barton”. The clock tolls at midnight, the body disappears, and there's someone at the door. Detective Barton lets in Henry Doyle, Nora, and the cop who acts very suspiciously. Detective Barton, Henry Doyle, Nora, and the cop continue upstairs where Henry Doyle promptly takes control of the situation by pulling out a gun and effectively capturing Detective Barton, Rose, and Ben. Ben tries to escape, but ends up in the bathroom where Sheldrake has been hiding with the necklace. Ben is able to easily sneak the necklace out of Sheldrake's pocket and into his own. Mr. Ackroyd reappears  saying he's Sheldrake and that they should leave immediately. Henry and the cop tie up Detective Barton and Rose and then head down towards the train with Nora. Mr. Ackroyd stays behind to untie Detective Barton and his daughter. Sheldrake finally leaves the bathroom and ends up fighting with Mr. Ackroyd. When trying to help, Ben accidentally knocks out Mr. Ackroyd. Rose stays behind with Mr. Ackroyd and now Nora, the cop, Henry Doyle, Sheldrake, Ben, and Detective Barton are ready to board the train . Detective Barton is the only one not able to successfully board the train so he goes and hijacks a bus to follow the train. On the train Ben finds himself in the wine car and decides to have a little fun. Meanwhile The cop, Henry, and Sheldrake head towards the front of the train and leave Nora alone. The men kill the conductor of the train because the conductor accidentally spots them. Sheldrake realizes that he doesn't have the necklace anymore and they head back to see if Nora has it. The cop is the first to reach Nora and he handcuffs her to the car. Ben goes to Nora's car and then gives the necklace to the cop. There's a bunch of shuffling around, the train is losing control and starts going way to fast, Detective Barton's plan is set into motion and the train crashes and falls into the water. Detective Barton jumps in and saves Nora. The scene cuts to the police station where Ben, Nora, Detective Barton, and Henry are all drying off. Henry tries to be sly and claims that he's Detective Barton. The real Detective Barton reveals who he is and says the entire night was a trap to retrieve the diamond necklace, capture Sheldrake, and capture Henry Doyle. Detective Barton asks Nora out to breakfast and Ben opens the blanket he's drying off with to reveal the diamond necklace shimmering about his neck.
