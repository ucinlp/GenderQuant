Jeanne Fabre, a carefree loner, spends her time rollerblading through Paris and job-hunting, a nuisance she endures to indulge her widowed mother, Louise, who runs a day-care center out of their house. As they are watching a news program on television about anti-semitic attacks, Louise recognizes the person on TV: Samuel Bleistein, a prestigious Jewish lawyer, who was many years ago in love with her. Louise arranges a job interview for her daughter at Bleistein’s law firm. On his part, Samuel Bleistein receives the visit of his son Alex, who has comes to Paris to celebrate his son Nathan’s upcoming Bar mitzvah. Alex's encounter with his ex-wife Judith, who is Samuel’s assistant, is tense since they do no get along. Jeanne’s job interview is a disaster. Evidently she is ill qualified and badly prepared. Unfazed by the interview, Jeanne resumes rollerblading and unexpectedly meets Franck a young wrestler, who takes an instant interest on her. A relationship ensues and the couple eventually move-in together when Franck finds a job as the caretaker in an electrical shop in the owner’s absence. The place turns out to contain hidden drugs and Franck is badly wounded in a fight with a drug dealer, who flees. The police let Jeanne go but arrest Franck, who rejects her when she visits him at the hospital. He knows she was lying the whole time during the relationship about having a job. Heartbroken and angered, she goes home to live with her mother. During the night, she wakes up from her bed and grabs a black marker. Drawing three swastikas on her body, she then grabs a knife and proceeds to cut herself. She then grabs a pair of scissors and cuts off part of her hair. She then sneaks quietly outside into the night. She alleges to have been brutally attacked by hoodlums on the RER suburban train because they thought she was Jewish. The incident becomes a huge national cause celebre. Louise, however, guesses that her daughter has been lying. Meanwhile Alex, indisposed towards his ex wife, decides not to go to Nathan’s upcoming Bar Mitzvah. Judith begs him to reconsider. Behind their mutual apparent animosity, they still love each other. At his hotel room, they make love and reconcile. Louise, convinced that her daughter is lying about the attack on the train, asks Samuel for help. Samuel suggests that they hear this through, and wants her to come and stay at his house for the night. Louise and Jeanne board a train and travel to meet Samuel and his family at his house country by a lake. At Samuel’s house, Nathan accuses Jeanne of lying about the whole affair. When all gather for dinner, Jeanne repeats the same story she told the police: that six youths approached her and, assuming she was Jewish , proceeded to beat her. After some extensive questioning, she decides to call it a night, but runs away and crosses a lake. Nathan helps Jeanne when it starts to rain hard and invites her into his little shack, a safe haven to get away from his parents once in a while. He notices she is all wet, and has her take off her clothes. Jeanne strips down and sits next to the fireplace with Nathan. She shows him her scars, as he still does not believe her story, but confesses in the end she made it up. Nathan convinces her to confess she lied. The next morning Jeanne tells the truth. Samuel has her write an apology. They travel back to Paris by train and Samuel and Louise share one more goodbye. Jeanne goes to the police and is put in jail for 48 hours as punishment for her serious false statements. When Franck is interviewed about Jeanne, Franck says he was in love with her, despite her lying, and would do it all over again given the chance. Samuel attends Nathan’s Bar Mitzvah, where he sees the television footage of the reporters interviewing Louise. When they asked about how her daughter knew the name of Bleistein Louise lies and says she does not know. Jeanne returns to live with her mother. She receives a postcard from Nathan, who is in love with her. Jeanne takes on rollerblading down the street.
