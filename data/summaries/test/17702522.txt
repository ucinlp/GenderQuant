The movie centers around efforts by German intelligence to find the target of an upcoming raid by the mythical "B-99 bomber." To achieve this end, they interrogate a recently shot-down air crew. The German officers use various methods to discover this information, some of them quite subtle. Though no physical brutality is used, the Germans at one point stage a mock execution. Each airman eventually provides useful information because of their own stupidity or naivete. Some of what they say, which the enemy finds useful, seems innocuous but is used by the Germans as pieces of a larger puzzle. In the end, the Germans are able to find the target of the raid and there are heavy casualties. The message of the movie, delivered by an intelligence officer played by Lloyd Nolan, is to not talk under any circumstances, that even innocuous conversation can help the enemy, not to let down one's guard, and to not try to outwit the enemy.
