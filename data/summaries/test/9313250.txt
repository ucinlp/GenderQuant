Junior Creative is about the corporate malevolence that can underlie the veneer of a self-consciously hip Advertising Agency. Three "junior creatives", co-workers and friends, all working on the same account for the same client but working separately. You're an art school graduate and you've scored. You've landed a job that allows you to exercise your creative abilities, dress however you want, act in a non-corporate fashion and work with funny, interesting people who are creative like yourself. You work at a hip Ad Agency on Newbury Street in Boston. Sure, management can be a little uptight, but it's only because they see the writing on the wall; when it comes to being cutting-edge and creative, youth is king. You're young and the throne lies unguarded. Junior Creative is about the strange sensation of making art to sell popsicles. It's also about the malevolence that can underlie even the glossiest of corporate veneers. Three "junior creatives", co-workers and friends, all working on the same account for the same client but working separately. Only the hippest will survive.
