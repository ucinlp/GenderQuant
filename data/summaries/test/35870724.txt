Dr. Alex Cross  is a psychiatrist and police lieutenant who lives in Detroit with his wife, Maria , their children, Damon and Janelle, and his grandmother, Nana Mama. Upon learning that Maria is pregnant with their third child, Cross considers accepting a job as an FBI profiler, but fears Maria's reaction, as it'd require them to relocate to Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, a man called Picasso  attends to an illegal underground Mixed Martial Arts fighting ring, where he flirts with businesswoman Fan Yau . After brutally beating his opponent, Picasso is invited to Fan Yau's house, where he sedates her while they're having sex, tortures and kills her. Police Captain Richard Brookwell  calls Cross and his partner, Tommy Kane , to the crime scene. On the way there, Cross tells Kane about Maria's pregnancy and the the FBI's offer, and Kane reveals that he is secretly dating their colleague, Monica Ashe . Cross deduces that Picasso is a professional assassin, and finds a sketch made behind by Picasso, revealing that his next target is businessman Erich Nunemarcher . Cross, Kane and Ashe go to Nunemarcher's office, but Nunemarcher ignores their claims. Picasso manages to enter the building, but is prevented from killing Nunemarcher by Cross, and escapes after being shot by Kane. Cross analyzes a drop of Picasso's blood and learns that he is a psychotic former member of the Special Forces and that his real target is billionaire CEO Leon Mercier . Cross informs Mercier that Picasso might be trying to kill him. Meanwhile, as revenge for their earlier interferance, Picasso attacks Ashe, sedating and beating her; and kills Maria with a sniper shot, leading both Cross and Kane to swear revenge against him. Cross and Kane learn that Picasso is targeting Mercier at a conference and informs Brookwell, who isolates the area. However, Picasso is able to kill Mercier by firing a bazooka from a moving train. Cross and Kane chase after Picasso and corner him at an abandoned theater, where Picasso and Cross fight and the fight ends with Picasso falling to his death. Cross eventually learns that Picasso's employer was Mercier himself. Having emblezzed money from his clients, Mercier asked for Yau and Nunemarcher's help to fake his death and flee to Bali, and then hired Picasso to eliminate Yau, Nunemarcher and a double pretending to be the real Mercier. However, Cross is able to plant drugs in Mercier's belongings before he leaves and informs the local police. Mercier is arrested in Singapore and condemned to death by firing squad. Having captured Maria's murderer, Cross decides to accept the FBI's offer and move to Washington with his family. Before he leaves, Kane reveals that he also applied for a job in the FBI, hoping that they'll work together again one day, and they part ways.
