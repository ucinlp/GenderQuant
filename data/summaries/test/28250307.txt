Hopper stars as 1950s hardboiled private detective Phillip Lovecraft, in a fictional universe where magic is real, monsters and mythical beasts stalk the back alleys, zombies are used as cheap labor, and everyone — except Lovecraft — uses magic every day. Yet, cars, telephones and other modern technology also exist in this world. Witch Hunt takes place in the 1950s during the red scare, in which magic is substituted for communism. It is a sequel to the HBO-produced film Cast a Deadly Spell. Hopper plays Lovecraft in place of Fred Ward. Additionally, many characters have different background stories then Cast a Deadly Spell. For example, Lovecraft refuses to use magic in Cast a Deadly Spell on principle, and because of a bad experience in Witch Hunt.
