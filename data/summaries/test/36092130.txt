The film takes place ten years later after the events of the first film. Clint Goodman, the man whose wife and lover tried to get murder him by giving him a toxin, would be buried alive as being mistaken for dead. He would wake up in the coffin and would exact revenge on his wife and her lover. Following the first film, Clint has been living a solitude life elsewhere under the name Michael Haden, while everyone in the original town believes he is dead. His friend, Sheriff Sam Eberly has died, and so Clint decides to come back for the funeral. At the funeral, Sam's niece, Laura Riskin, who knew Clint a long time ago, notices him but he leaves before she could approach him. After his funeral, Laura finds out that Sam bought some stock that is worth $250,000, which he has left for her. While she and her husband Randy decide what to do with the money, Laura decides to use it to start a family but Randy, who hates his life in the small town wants to buy a yacht and leave town for good. Laura doesn't empathize with him, but unknown to her, he is cheating on her with local vixen, Roxanne. He tells her that once he finds a way to get away, he'll leave Laura for her, however she's not patient. Randy hears the story of what happened to Clint and decides to do the same thing to Laura. Meanwhile, Laura eventually corners Clint, who tells her to forget him cause technically he is a wanted man. Randy comes to Laura, and Laura, thinking he has changed, decides to forgive him. When they go out to dinner late that evening, he gives her the very same toxin that was originally given to Clint, slipping it into her wine during their dinner, where he makes plans to ensure what happened to Clint doesn't happen again. Laura seemingly dies after consuming some of the poisoned wine, where she goes into cardiac arrest, and dies suddenly. When the doctor asks Randy if he wants an autopsy he declines, stating that Laura would be against it. The police do not treat the event as suspicious as Laura's family has a history of heart failure. While he is planning her funeral, Clint reads about her death in the paper, which causes him to have a heart attack. When he is at the hospital recuperating, he wants to know how Laura has died, but the doctor only tell him that her funeral is being prepared. He wishes to go to her funeral but the doctor denies him being able to leave the hospital. At the morgue, just as she is about to be embalmed, the machine malfunctions and the staff do not embalm her, despite Randy having previously requested that Laura's body be embalmed twice. After Laura's funeral, Clint approaches Randy warning him that Laura may not be all dead, with Randy questioning who Clint is, as well as his sanity. After Clint has a nightmare about his escaping, he goes to dig Laura up and finds that she really is dead, causing him to die, due to health issues caused by the toxin originally given to him. All of a sudden Laura wakes up and escapes her grave, where she then puts Clint's body in her coffin and fills it up. She goes home to find Randy and Roxanne in bed together. She takes a spear gun and when she hears that Randy wants to have kids with her, she changes her mind, deciding to plot revenge. Over the next few days, Randy starts to notice strange things happening around his home, like the place being really clean and his wife's wedding ring lying in the middle of the table. He then goes to have his wife's grave exhumed to make sure she is really dead, but instead finds Clint's body. When the funeral director wants to know why she wasn't embalmed, they discover that the deceased person was in fact Clint. When they go to exhume Clint's grave, they find the skeletal remains of Joanna and Cort, along with the money they got from selling his business. Randy, who now knows that Laura is still alive decides to leave town and purchase the yacht immediately. As he and Roxanne are packing up, they are trapped inside his shed, she then takes a hose attached to his exhaust pipe and puts it through the vent, causing them both to pass out. Randy and Roxanne awake to find themselves in a bedroom of the yacht with all doors and windows locked. When the yacht leans, he realizes that Laura is trying to bury them alive at sea. He goes to shut off the valve but she has broken it off. In another room, they find a set of funeral clothes and a buoy that says "Rest in peace Randy and Roxanne". Laura soon reveals herself and wants to know why Randy tried to kill her. Shortly after, Laura blocks off a vent and before the yacht sinks, she leaves on a speedboat. At the end of the film, Laura leaves her home and goes to Clint's grave, thanking him for what he's done. She then leaves town, with the final shot of Randy and Roxanne screaming after being buried at sea.
