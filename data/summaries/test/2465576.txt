 Rose  and her husband, Christopher Da Silva , are concerned about their adopted daughter, Sharon , who has been sleepwalking while calling the name of a town, "Silent Hill". Desperate for answers, Rose takes Sharon to Silent Hill. As they approach the town, she is pursued by police officer Cybil Bennett . A child appears in the road, causing Rose to swerve and crash the car, knocking herself unconscious. When she awakens, Sharon is missing, while fog and falling ash blanket the town. Rose wanders the empty streets of Silent Hill looking for her daughter and instead encounters monsters. Rose meets a woman named Dahlia Gillespie  who speaks of her own daughter, Alessa, being abused by the townspeople and, upon seeing a photo of Sharon in the locket around Rose's neck, claims that Sharon is Alessa. Rose returns to her car and runs into Cybil, who arrests her. After they discover that the road leading out of town leads to a fracture, they pair up to search the town. Meanwhile, Christopher also simultaneously scours the town, shown to be abandoned and without mist and falling ash, with the assistance of officer Thomas Gucci . Christopher discovers documents revealing that the town was abandoned after a coal seam fire thirty years ago, along with a photograph of Dahlia's daughter, who bears a strong physical resemblance to Sharon. Told to stop investigating under threat of incarceration, he returns home. Rose and Cybil meet Anna , a woman who leads them to a local church for refuge. As they approach it, Anna is killed by the monster Pyramid Head . In the church, Rose and Cybil discover a cult, headed by a woman named Christabella . Christabella tells Rose about a demon, who knows Sharon's whereabouts. After convincing Christabella to help them locate the demon, Rose and Cybil are taken to a local hospital. There, Christabella also sees the photo of Sharon in Rose's locket and, seeing the likeness between Sharon and Alessa, condemns Rose and Cybil as witches. Cybil allows herself to be captured by the townspeople in order for Rose to escape and descend into the hospital basement. There, Rose encounters a burned Alessa on a bed and a being in the form of a girl who strongly resembles Sharon. In a flashback, Rose discovers that Silent Hill had a long history of witch burnings, stemming from the cult's beliefs. Thirty years prior to Rose's arrival, Alessa was stigmatized for having been born out of wedlock by an unknown father; her schoolmates bullied her, while the adults made no effort to protect her. Dahlia agreed to Christabella's suggestion that she allow the cult to "restore innocence" in Alessa. When not allowed to follow Alessa into the ritual, Dahlia realized that they intended to kill her daughter and ran to the police. Alessa was ritually burned, but in the midst of the ritual, a fire accidentally burst out. When Dahlia returned with the police, Alessa was badly burned, but alive. While in the hospital, Alessa's pain and rage caused her "dark" side to manifest in the form of a duplicate of herself, who refers to itself as the darkness inside Alessa.{{cite web}}{{cite web}} Rose learns that Sharon is the manifestation of Alessa's remaining innocence and goodness. After the flashback, Rose is told that she must aid Alessa in her revenge by granting her entry into the church and that Christabella will soon find Sharon and attempt to burn her as well. Rose enters the church after Cybil has just been immolated by the townspeople, and Sharon is about to suffer a similar fate. She confronts Christabella with her knowledge of the truth, attempting to convince the cult that they are in denial of their own fate. Christabella stabs Rose, causing her blood to drip onto the church floor. The blood serves as a portal, which Alessa rises out of and proceeds to kill Christabella and the townspeople, leaving Dahlia, Rose, and Sharon the only survivors.  Rose and Sharon return home; though they are in the same room as Christopher, who has also returned home, they cannot see each other.
