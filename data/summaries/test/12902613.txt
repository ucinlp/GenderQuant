Trevor Howard plays Windwalker, an aged Cheyenne warrior. As a husband and father, he helplessly watched the killing of his wife and the kidnapping of one of his sons during a raid by rival Crow warriors. After many years of searching for his lost son unsuccessfully, Windwalker dies during the winter months of 1797 in what will become the state of Utah. The Great Spirit reawakens him for one final task: to answer the mystery about his missing son in order for him to have a peaceful afterlife. Windwalker then helps his other son lead a group of fellow Cheyenne people who are trekking south towards warmer climates and facing not only the elements of nature but a small group of hostile Crow warriors. With his family safe and his son restored to him Windwalker confronts his old enemy and offers him peace, but the Crow refuses, forcing a final battle.
