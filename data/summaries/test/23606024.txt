Martin Beck is on his way to a vacation with his colleague and girlfriend Lena Klingström when several gruesome murders in the Stockholm Metro force him to return. Without any kind of motivation, he is forced to lead the investigation of the strange murders. There are four things connecting the murders: they are all in the subway, they are all decapitations, and a sign is left by the murderer/murderers. This sign is "X-(", which means "death" in 1337. The last connecting thing is that before every murder, all lights has been turned off . As the investigation progresses it becomes clear that Erik Lindgren, a man who works in the subway has some kind of connection to the murderers and that they are living in the system of tunnels beneath Stockholm which is much more vast than the subway system. When Erik is found, he reveals that the murderers are kids that live mostly in the tunnels, playing a game called "Final Doom", and that his sister is one of those kids. They have built their own view of the reality through the game and are playing it by killing people in the subway, and gaining "frags". They share these murders with other kids online and reaches new "levels" by gaining frags. When Erik is guiding Beck to the entrance of their hideout, they are ambushed by the kids, but the Swedish task force arrives just in time to save Beck, but too late for Erik. Eventually, Beck finds Erik's sister, Annika, who takes Beck and the task force to the hideout. The hideout is empty but for a single little boy, who are playing games. He tells Annika that the other kids are out on a raid. By reading text files on one of the computers, Annika discovers that they are raiding the station underneath Odenplan . Beck and the task force arrives just in time to arrest the kids, who are armed with machetes and night vision goggles. Stefan, the leader, attempts to kill Annika upon finding out that she betrayed them, but is shot. When Beck arrives to the street, journalists asks him if there is a connection to some similar murders in New York and he tells Klingström that he may not be able to go on the planned vacation, because he maybe have to go to New York and assist with the investigation.
