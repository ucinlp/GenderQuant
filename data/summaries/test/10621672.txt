Lau Kar Leung is the current teacher of a kung fu school in Hong Kong, however it is the 80â€™s and people are not interested in "old school" kung fu anymore. He receives a letter telling him to pick up the schools boss from the airport which much to his surprise is Kara Hui. Kara is the daughter of the schools master, thus making her the "de facto" boss. She is very much Americanized and begins making changes at the school and taking in students off the street, discos, and bars, which angers the traditionalist Lau Kar Leung. Eventually Kara gets in trouble with a local gang headed up by Wang Lung Wei, and after provoking a fight at bar owned by Wang, Lau Kar Leung is forced to rescue her and teach Wang Lung Wei and his thugs a slight lesson. This forces Wang to retaliate until a fight breaks out in a local gym in which Wang Lung Wei is defeated and Kara eventually returns to the U.S. after realizing Lau should be in charge of the school.
