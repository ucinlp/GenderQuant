{{Expand section}} The film is set at Christmas time. The narrator starts out with: Many years ago, before there were any automobiles and before we had electricity or even gas lighting and when people used horses if they wanted to go out for a ride and oil lamps and candles if they needed a light, there lived in a small country town, yes, a butcher, a baker, and a candlestick-maker. With just over a week to go before christmas, the townspeople were busy indeed and none moreso than the candlemaker and his young son, Tom. For in those days, quite small boys were expected to behave like grown men.
