Happy end tells the life story of a butcher named Bedřich Frydrych; however, it is told entirely in reverse, giving rise to a different story than the one a forward-flowing narrative would depict. It thus begins with Bedřich's birth , followed by a childhood spent in school , whereupon he sets out into the world and soon marries, although he has to assemble his wife-to-be from various parts . The reversed chronology also applies to dialogue: lines are read in an ostensibly reversed order, variously resulting in sheer situational comedy and dada.
