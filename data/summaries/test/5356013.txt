One day, he visits Priya to give her an anklet that his grandmother, who recently died, had wished for Priya to have when she became Dev's bride. Initially unaware of Priya's condition, Dev realizes the truth when he sees the painting in another room. The two embrace tearfully and he assures Priya that he will love her no matter what.
