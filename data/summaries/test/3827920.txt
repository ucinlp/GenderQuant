60 years ago, a doll maker falls in love with a woman in a red kimono during the Japanese occupation in a countryside in Korea. After making a doll  as a gesture of his love, she falls in love with him as well. Later, when the red kimono woman is found murdered, the blame is put on the doll maker. He was eventually arrested and killed by vigilantes in the woods. The doll, not content to be without her maker, sits by his grave for all eternity. In the present day, Hae-mi, the sculptor, Tae-seong, the "model" who is looking for work, Young-ha, the woman who claims she can talk to her Demian doll, Jeong-gi, the photographer and Sun-young, the ditzy high school student, arrived at an isolated museum in the middle of nowhere with the promise of dolls to be made in their image. They are greeted by the museum’s curator, who also introduces them to the museum’s dolls, as well as the paraplegic doll maker, Im. However, when Yeong-ha's doll has its head separated from its body, the doll  kills the guests one by one. Im later admits that she is using the red kimono doll to kill the descendants of the vigilants who assassinated the maker of the doll; Im also reveals that the guests whom she invited are the descendants. At the same time, the clues point to a mysterious, young woman named Mi-na, the soul of the doll Hae-Mi once owned as a child. Being the only victim left, Hae-mi tries to avoid the attempted assassination of Mi-na. Im, however, destroys Mi-na's soul by poking her eyes and beheading her and tries to kill Hae-mi. Successfully, Hae-mi kills her. When Im and the museum’s curator were killed, the Im's husband tells her that they shouldn't have brought the red kimono doll. In the end, all the corpses  are being burned down in a fire; Hae-mi questions herself whether it is the dolls' or the humans' fault as she throws Mi-na's head into the fire. A young Hae-mi then throws Mi-na out the window in the flashback.
