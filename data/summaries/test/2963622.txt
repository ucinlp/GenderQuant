Captain Dan Tracey and his two lieutenants are ordered to investigate trouble on the resort planet Clitoris, a pleasure world filled with shopping and gambling where, according to the "Articles of the Venus Convention", only women are allowed. A variety of problems are occurring on the planet; most notably, several important pieces of "Girlinium" have been stolen from the Empress Nueva Gabor. "Girlinium", as explained by the Empress, is a very rare gem found only in the caverns of the fourth moon of Girlina, a distant planet. It is used by the Empress to help the planet maintain its delicate orbit surrounding its sun. The stolen pieces must be found or the planet will fall into ruin as evidenced by increasingly violent earthquakes. The captain and his men, in order to remain undercover, become women via sex reversal pills and pose as showgirls from Earth performing a mid-twentieth century lounge act for the Empress' annual off-world slumber party while investigating the crime.
