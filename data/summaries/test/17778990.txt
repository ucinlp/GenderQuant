{{Plot}} Laida Magtalas is a modern-day Belle who works hard to provide for her family while hoping that someday she will meet her prince charming and that they will live happily ever after together. That would-be prince charming is none other than "Miggy", the youngest member of the Montenegro clan — a well established family in the business world. Moony Laida's desire to finally meet Miggy leads her to apply as an Editorial Assistant at his newly launched men’s magazine, "Bachelor". In spite of the fact that a relationship with Miggy may prove to be a long shot, Laida revels working in such close proximity with the man of her dreams. The film opens with Laida starting out her day for a job interview with Flippage, owned and manage by her crush Miguel " Miggy " Montenegro. a son of a wealthy and prominent business family . Unbeknownst to her, on the day of her interview, Miggy was having a heated meeting with his creative team on the issue of the Bachelor, Flippage’s men's magazine. Miggy’s mean demeanor and undermining of both his friend and editors cause a walkout of half of the team. In the middle of the chaos laida was hired of the spot after she presented Miggy with coffee left by an attendant who also walked out after being screamed at. The coffee will be a symbolic part throughout the film as Laida would often put post it messages on the coffee cups that she serves Miggy. By some stroke of luck, Laida lands the job. Overwhelmed by being in the presence of her long–time crush and by her recently acquired career, Laida remains blinded to the fact that the Miggy of her dreams is very different from the real one. In reality, he is an unapologetic, hothead who always thinks he's in the right and obsesses about nothing making his magazine number one. Everyone is scared of him with the exception of the love-stuck Laida, who adamantly defends him. Imperceptively, she caters to his every whim, even sending her in his absence on a date with his girlfriend, breaking her heart a little. Her colleagues question her unrelenting devotion to such a monster and when Laida continues to proves her loyalty to Miggy, gossip regarding her feelings for the boss starts to circulate. However the moment was short lived, as the next day after Laida made a suggestion in regards to an article content that Miggy should put for the magazine, Miggy publicly humiliates her and her knowledge of sex and questioned her virtue  in front of the staff by making her say the word “ Sex”. Miggy was later embarrassed himself after he realized that it was Laida who made the last minute call and effort to find a printing press to do a rush job on their magazines overhaul. After being chastised by the despotic Miggy, Laida’s finally opens her eyes and sees him for the tyrant he truly is. The confrontation with Laida was a rude awakening for Miggy as well and he realizes why people are so put-off by him. Miggy then tries with much difficulty on his part of “apologize” in his own way to Laida. First by ordering pizza for the team and serving a slice himself to her. Which Laida ignores. Laida, now disenchanted with Miggy was called in by her officemates to go to Miggy’s condo to deliver the article drafts for approval much to her dismay. As well it was her mother's birthday. However upon arriving in Miggy’s apartment, she found Miggy high with fever with very little food or necessities in his apartment, with no househelp or family to care for him. Laida took care of Miggy, missing her own mother's birthday. Miggy woke up during a break in fever and saw the exhausted Laida next to him patting his back as a mother would to a sick child. This prompted Miggy to realize his feelings to Laida igniting a change in him and wishing Laida to be more closer to him as well as being more friendly with the rest of his team. The productivity and atmosphere of the company thus also changed in a positive note. Miggy also became comfortable enough to tell laida the truth behind his past, that he was an illegitimate child of his father later adopted to the main family after his mother's death. Thus his strong desire to prove himself to his father and brother. For the first time in his life, Miggy garners the gumption to apologize and this new-found humility opens up a whole new world of “firsts” for Miggy. With Laida's help, Miggy slowly learns to be more of a team player and the true value of loyalty.
