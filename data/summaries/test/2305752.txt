Diana Armstrong , a young, unwed mother struggles to make enough money to pay for her college education. Diana ends up working at a shoe store, when she meets Ronnie , and Tricks , two shady bisexual strippers that work for Dolla Bill  at The Players Club. They convince Diana she would make better money stripping, by saying "use what you got to get what you want". Dolla Bill gives Diana a job giving her the name Diamond. Everything is fine until four years into the game her cousin Ebony Armstrong  comes to live with her. After listening to Dolla's rendition of "The Strippin' Game", she starts working at the club. Ebony soon gets out of control, excessively drinking, staying out all night and getting more influenced by Ronnie and Tricks, who encourage Ebony to do more out of club parties for groups of men. Diana tries to warn Ebony to stay away from "those two" and quit doing house parties, but Ebony declines being told what to do, choosing to ignore Diana's advice as well as coldheartedly reminding her about the time when Ronnie sexually took advantage of Diana when she was passed out at a previous party. Further tension develops between Ebony and Diana when Diana returns home one night after fleeing her obsessive customer Myrin, to find Ebony in bed with her boyfriend Lance. Diana chases Lance out with her gun, and kicks Ebony out of her apartment. Diana then begins dating Blue , a DJ at the Player's Club. Meanwhile, Ebony is offered a gig to dance at Ronnie's brother Junior's  bachelor party, under the pretense from Ronnie that other girls from the club will be dancing there too. When she realizes that she will be the only woman there in a hotel room full of hungry men, she desperately tries calling Diana to come and pick her up, but Diana doesn't, still being mad with her. Reggie  and his friend Clyde , both feeling dissed by Diana and Ebony from a previous encounter, lie to Junior that Ebony will have sex with him, claiming that they "ran a train" on her. Excited, Junior bursts in on Ebony while she is changing. Ebony resists and Junior beats and rapes her. Ronnie discovers this and they both flee the hotel room. Later, Diana has a change of heart and she and Blue decide to check up on Ebony at the hotel, only to discover her bloody and unconcsious body on a bed. This proves to be the last straw to Diana, who was growing tired of the stripper game anyway. Angered, she grabs her gun and goes to the Players Club, where Ronnie and Tricks are hiding out. After scaring the other strippers away, Diana gives the gun to Blue to cover her while she gets into a brutal fistfight with Ronnie and ultimately wins, leaving Ronnie a bloody mess. She personally quits in front of Dolla Bill, punches Tricks and leaves along with Blue. Ronnie and Tricks are arrested by the police on charges of prostitution and accessories to kill, and Junior has been picked up as well. Later that night, Diana's timing proves to be perfect when a gangster who Dolla Bill owes money to, the wheelchair-bound St. Louis, comes to collect. He personally shoots up the club . After his thugs grab Dolla and throw him into the trunk of a car, St. Louis has his henchman Brooklyn  destroy the club with a LAW rocket. A year passes afterward and Diana has moved on with her life. She's gotten Ebony a job working at a shoe store. She continues to date Blue, and has become a successful news anchor of the city.
