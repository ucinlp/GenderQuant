The Stooges, working as carpenters for at least ten years, are temporarily left in charge of a drugstore, assembling a door with disastrous results. When a liquor salesman stops by and asks for a drink, the Stooges mix a drink using all manner of medicines and chemicals, and mixed with a rubber boot. The concoction reacts, and it is so strong that it cuts through a wicker chair serving as an improvised sieve. But the man loves the libation , and he convinces the Stooges to pose as Scotsmen and attend a party at his boss' house, where he can sign the Stooges to a liquor contract for their invention, dubbed the "Breath of Heather". One highlight of the party is an Italian tenor  singing "Santa Lucia." The Stooges express their displeasure by firing off grapes down his throat to stop him, then a banana into his mouth at the final "Santa Luciaaa-," which does the trick. Angered at being made into a "fruit salad," he exits in disgust, calling them "pigs." In reaction, Moe tosses a pineapple at the exiting singer, which hits him off camera after making a physics-defying turn in mid-air. After a raucous Highland Fling dance (actually referred to by Moe as the "Lowland Shim" , and a disastrous dinner, the barrel of the lethal "scotch" is presented. The Stooges' attempt to tap the barrel results in an explosion which engulfs all the party guests in a sea of foam.
