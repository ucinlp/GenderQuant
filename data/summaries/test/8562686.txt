Bimbo is walking down the street when he suddenly disappears down an open manhole. He lands in an underground clubhouse of a secret society. The leader asks Bimbo "Wanna be a member?", but he replies "No!" Bimbo is then sent through a series of dangerous events. He is repeatedly asked by the leader "Wanna be a member?" but keeps refusing. Bimbo is brought through a series of mysterious doors that lead him into yet another sub-basement. Out of the basement door pops Betty Boop . Bimbo flees through various death traps  before landing in front of the mysterious order's leader again. Bimbo still refuses to become a member until the leader removes "his" costumeâ€”to reveal herself as Betty Boop. Bimbo changes his tune and decides he DOES want to be a member. The rest of the society members remove their costumes, showing that they are all Betty Boop clones, and Bimbo joins the Boops in a happy dance. "Tiger Rag" and "The Vamp" are featured throughout the soundtrack.
