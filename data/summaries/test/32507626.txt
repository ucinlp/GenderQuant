Fred plans to marry his girlfriend Mara, and he proposes her at the sold–out basketball match. Instead of accepting, Mara puts that decision on her spoiled son, Linus. In order to get Linus to like him, Fred decides to give him a basketball from the Linus' favourite team. He poses as a wheelchair–bound fan so that he could get it. But when he catches the ball, he also catches the attention of young, attractive filmmaker Denise, who wants to feature an invalid fan in an image film for the team. Fred has to keep playing his role, while real invalid and really furious fan Ronny might call his bluff at any moment.
