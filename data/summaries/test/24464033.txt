During the Western Desert Campaign of World War II, two officers are interviewed to command a dangerous commando mission far behind enemy lines. South African Major Brand is an experienced professional soldier but does not speak Arabic and has only a limited knowledge of the area in Libya in which the patrol is to operate. Welsh Captain Leith is the opposite; an amateur volunteer with extensive knowledge of the area who knows a local guide and speaks fluent Arabic as well. It is decided that both officers will go, but with Major Brand in command. Major Brand's wife Jane is an RAF Flight Lieutenant who enlisted to be near her husband. When Brand invites Leith to dinner with his wife, he picks up the fact that the two had previously had an affair before she married Brand. The unit parachutes behind enemy lines with the mission of attacking a German headquarters and bringing back secret plans from a safe to be opened by Wilkins, an experienced safecracker. Dressed as local civilians, Brand shakes in fright when he has to knife a German sentry; the deed is done by Leith. The mission is completed successfully with only one death and one man wounded. The patrol ambushes a German detachment, capturing a German colonel Leith knows was responsible for the secret information. Leith remains behind with the wounded man, who he kills rather than let fall into enemy hands to be tortured for information. The patrol is supposed to escape on camels, but they discover the men left with them have been murdered and looted of the camels and their weapons. During the long march back, Brand's animosity towards Leith grows, not only due to the affair with his wife, but Brand fears Leith will reveal Brand as a coward to headquarters and destroy his career.
