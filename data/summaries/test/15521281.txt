Amir has always wished to travel to Abadan and now in his elderly days he wants to materialise his wish, but before doing so he needs to return a package to a friend. In this process he goes missing. Marjan, a middle-aged, middle-class Tehran resident and Amir's daughter, is distraught when her father goes missing. She goes to see her estranged husband, Aman, who reluctantly agrees to look for Amir, while Marjan watches over Aman's house, which is being renovated. Aman enlists the aid of his old friend, Atta, and the two drive off in search of Amir, who presumably took off to find an old friend whom he seems to have forgotten died years earlier.
