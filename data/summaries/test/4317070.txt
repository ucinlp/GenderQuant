Danny Lee's act soon turns the head of Ralph, which is not good news for his bed-ridden wife Luanne . Luanne's nasty talent is her gift for gossip, and when she begins to suspect that Ralph has adultery on his mind, she starts spreading more ugly rumors that have just enough basis in fact to stick. Soon things spin out of control and a wave of violence begins.
