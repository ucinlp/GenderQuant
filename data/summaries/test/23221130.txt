Teito Monogatari Gaiden is set in an alternate universe apart from the chronology of the main series. Several characters from the main series make an appearance in this movie, although their histories have been completely changed. In 1995, a mental hospital is erected near the Japanese Ministry of Finance, located adjacent to the grave of Taira no Masakado. A young male nurse by the name of Jinâ€™ya Yanase is obsessed with the legend of Taira no Masakado and more importantly, the spirit of his evil subordinate Yasunori Kato. Slowly, he becomes possessed by Kato's spirit, who wants to use him as a new host to revive in the modern world. Keiko Tatsumiya , is an old woman living homeless on the streets of Tokyo. When she senses the presence of Yasunori Kato, she must regain her resolve to face the demon-god and vanquish his spirit once and for all. After this film, the character of Yasunori Kato has not been used again for any other movie based on the Teito Monogatari series. He did, however, make an appearance as the main villain of the 2006 fantasy film The Great Yokai War, directed by Takashi Miike with a novelization by Hiroshi Aramata.
