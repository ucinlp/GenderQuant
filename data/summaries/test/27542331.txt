The story begins with the human characters, Julie and Tommy, listening to records, until their father, Dan the Forest Ranger, reminds them they both have school in the morning. The kids go to bed and are soon asleep. Schaeffer, the humans' pet sheepdog and the newest member Broo stay awake and notice a falling star in the night sky. Schaeffer tells Broo about the belief that wishes can come true if they are made on a fallng star. Broo makes a wish, which Schaeffer interprets as "To be with our friends, dancing". Immediately afterwards, a space shuttle lands outside the cabin, piloted by Bert Raccoon, who takes the two dogs to a dance party elsewhere in the forest, with the rest of their friends attending . However, Cyril Sneer and Snag aren't happy with the party, as they are wanting some sleep, and they set about to try and stop the music. At one point they briefly succeed by cutting off the power supply, but Bert manages to restore the power back on and the party is saved, much to Cyril's chagrin. As the party comes to a close, Bert flys Schaeffer and Broo back home and thens flies off into the night sky.
