Lorna Bellstratten , a waitress with dreams of being in show business, is duped by her drug-dealer boyfriend Michael Vega  into delivering a bomb to an undercover cop. Though Lorna survives the explosion , she finds herself --as the only material witness to the crime she unwittingly abetted--wanted by both the cops and the mob . Distraught, Lorna flees to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico and takes out a contract on her own life  Meanwhile, Vega  hires Los Angeles bail bondsman, Eddie Moscone  to send in a bounty hunter to bring her back to LA alive. Eddie offers the job to bounty hunter Jack Walsh  for $10,000. He doesn't want to take the job because Eddie keeps on stiffing him his money. Eddie threatens to give the job to rival bounty hunter Marvin Dorfler, who does not make an appearance. When Walsh finds her in Cabo San Lucas, Lorna thinks he's her hitman. After a night of dancing, Lorna finds out the truth, hits Walsh out of anger and returns to her hotel room in a huff. Walsh's attempt to recover her is initially thwarted by the untimely arrival of the real hit-man, but they escape--with the hitman, the cops, and Vega's goons all hot on their trail. Along the way, the still-despondent Lorna keeps looking for--and finding--all manner of new ways to kill herself. And for the tough Jack Walsh, there's another problem. He's falling in love.
