Captain Jim Knight, and his crew Roxy, Tula and a chimp named Salty sail the South Seas in search of adventure. They discover a criminal gang has taken over a small island forcing the native pearl divers to dive beyond safe limits. After capturing the three man gang, Knight takes them to Tahiti for trial where the men escape and force Knight to sail them to New Zealand. Knight subdues them again but this time a minor French magistrate is sent to the island to try them there. The magistrate joins the criminals when a native boy locates the wreck of a lost ship containing a Burmese King's treasure.
