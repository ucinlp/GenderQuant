The film centers around Stacy and Goody , two socialite vampires living a good life in New York City. Goody was turned in 1841 by vampire queen Ciccerus . She struggled with her life as a vampire until Stacy was turned sometime during the 1990's. Goody was able to teach Stacy how to use her new abilities, like sustaining themselves on rat blood, but keeps her actual age a secret because she's afraid of being viewed as old. While at a vampire meeting, Stacy explains how she struggled with drug addiction as a human, but was now happy since being a vampire gave her a second-chance. Goody also discovers that if their maker or "stem" Ciccerus is ever killed, they would revert back to their human ages. Stacy then meets a young man named Joey  in her night class. She finds out that Joey's last name is Van Helsing, but believes it may just be a coincidence. It turns out though that Joey's father  is a vampire hunter who works for the department of homeland security. Despite this, she decides to pursue the relationship. While working as an exterminator in a hospital, Goody runs into her ex-boyfriend Danny , an anti-war protester whom she dated during the sixties. Danny tries to run after her, but gives up and goes back to his wife's room. Goody explains to Stacy that Danny was the last man she fell in love with, but that she had to end the relationship because of her "condition". When Danny tracks her down, she tells him that Goody was her mother, and that she has recently past away. Goody and Danny continue to see each other, which leads to him discovery the truth. Goody explains to him that she could have stayed with him longer, but felt that he would have missed his chance at finding someone. Their lives become even more complicated when Ciccerus attacks an entire Chinese restaurant full of people. They manage to bring one man to the hospital before sunrise, but Mr. Van Helsing finds out about it. Stacy also starts vomiting every time she wakes up, and Goody is told by Vlad that Stacy is pregnant, but that the baby won't survive unless she is turned back. Goody tells Stacy everything, and they decide to kill Ciccerus. Goody goes to Joey's father for help, since he is the only one who knows how to permanently kill a vampire. While talking, Goody explains how her husband and sisters were killed from a Cholera outbreak, and that being turned gave her the ability to care for her two children. Mr.Van Helsing has his assistant track down a family tree, which shows that Goody's living descendants were all successful and happy. With the help of Joey and his father, they manage to behead Ciccerus and put her remains in a sealed coffin. Stacy ages to look forty years-old, while Goody turns into an old woman. They go to Time Square where Goody reminisces about all the changes during her life, and she turns to dust when the sun comes up. The film ends with Stacy and Joey raising their daughter, whom they named Goody.
