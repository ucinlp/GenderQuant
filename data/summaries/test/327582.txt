Anderson  is a successful American hitman whose employer sends him to do a job in Argentina. His contacts inform him that his target is a former general. Things are not as easy as they seem. A paranoid Anderson simultaneously rents a room in two different hotels. From the safety but close proximity of one hotel room, he witnesses police converge on the other hotel. Anderson will fulfill his obligation to do the job despite the obvious reality that there is a leak. We witness the conspirator Miguel  being harshly interrogated by Buenos Aires police. Miguel can eventually breathe a sigh of relief when his conspirator within the Argentinian federal authorities shows up. Anderson  eventually makes it out of Argentina safely. The character of Jo-Jo is a small supporting role played by Frank Cassavetes, a son of the late director John Cassavetes and actress Gena Rowlands.
