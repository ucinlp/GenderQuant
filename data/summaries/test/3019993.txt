When one of the thugs is forced to tell them where Sulin is located, they learn Sulin is taken to Cambodia. Mac and Scott head towards Mac's private warehouse, an artillery factory. Mac tells Scott of Sulin's father's history. Mr. Nguyen was a Vietnamese general who for the sake of his family, stopped a deal with a Soviet militia. Mac becomes convinced that the Soviets have joined forces with the Vietnamese army and have set up base in Cambodia. Scott decides he must rescue Sulin. The next morning, Mac and Scott prepare as they await a helicopter. However, on their way out, they are surrounded by the Thai police. Narrowly making their escape, the helicopter arrives. The pilot is revealed to be none other than Terry. Terry and Mac used to be a couple, but things didn't pan out and the two constantly bicker at each other. Meanwhile, the leader of the Soviet Army, Yuri , has arrived. A Chinese refugee is amongst the recent prisoners of war and is challenged by Yuri to fight for his freedom. Yuri uses his brute strength to defeat the fighter. However, he tells the Chinese fighter he can walk away. As the fighter begins to leave, Yuri shoots him twice then grabs him. He throws him into a pit full of alligators, where the fighter unceremoniously dies. Yuri meets Sulin and threatens to send her in the pit if her father doesn't arrive soon. When Scott, Terry, and Mac arrive in Cambodia, they seek assistance with Colonel Tol Nol , an old customer of Mac's. When Mac offers artillery in exchange for help, Tol Nol refuses. However, Scott makes a deal on a new tank and Tol Nol accepts under the condition that Terry stays behind as well. Tol Nol's camp is then bombed with Scott has his arm injured in the process. The next day, Scott, Terry, and Mac travel by foot and come upon a Buddhist temple. When the monks are revealed to be spies, the trio use their martial arts skills to fend them off. The Vietnamese army arrive and kidnap Terry and supposedly kill Scott and Mac with a rocket launcher. However, Scott and Mac survive and head towards rescuing Terry and Sulin.

As Mac attempts to save Terry, he finally professes his love for her. However, it is too late as Terry dies. Scott and Yuri begin to fight with Yuri's strength getting the best of Scott. Scott, in an effort to lure Yuri away, hides in his office. When Yuri follows, he notices no one is inside. That is, until Scott jumps off a platform and begins to use his kicking skills on Yuri. Yuri catches Scott's foot and throws him to his desk and moves it towards Scott's legs to crush them. However, Scott grabs a painting behind him and crashes it on Yuri's head.
