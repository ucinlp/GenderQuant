The Stooges are mediocre paperhangers. Their client Mr. Beedle ([[Robert Williams  advises the boys to do a good job, but the end result looks like it was quickly cluttered with paper towels. Beedle is fuming, and threatens the boys, who make a quick escape across the hallway into the laboratory of the insane Professor Panzer  and his assistant Nikko . Panzer is searching for a human brain puny enough to place in the head of his gorilla Igor . Curly becomes the prime candidate, and Panzer locks the boys in his lab in order to secure Curly's "contribution." Then Igor gets loose, but takes an instant liking to Curly, which the feeble-minded Stooge reciprocates. Eventually, the boys destroy Panzer's lab, and quickly departâ€”taking Igor with them.
