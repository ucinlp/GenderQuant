Karthik  challenges a level headed industrialist Bhanumati  that he would marry either of her daughters, to take revenge on her for insulting him in his interview to get a job in her company. Meghana  falls for the young man, just for the one accidental kiss he gives her. The younger one Gagana  too follows suit, and now Karthik has a grip over both of Bhanumati’s daughter. Competiting with him is Bhanumati’s nephew , whose father  too encourages him to chase his cousins, and marry either of them to inherit their property. It is revealed in the flashback, that Bhanumati leaves her husband Suman, and Karthik is her nephew. How the responsible son-in-law sets his mom-in-law right and eliminates the villains from the game, is what the story is about.
