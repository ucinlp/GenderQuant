In a series of short skits, Leon Schuster uses candid camera and several disguises to stitch up the general public of South Africa. Such sketches include: *The watermelon pulse test, where Leon shows that a watermelon is only ripe when it does not have a heartbeat, much to the confusion of the seller. *Cooking on the bonnet of a car, while upsetting the traffic police. *Supposedly killing a cow in a butcher's shop.
