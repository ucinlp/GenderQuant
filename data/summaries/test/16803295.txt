Zoey's parents come for an unexpected visit to PCA to tell her and Dustin that they are moving to England. Mr. Brook's business is starting a new branch in London. When offered to accompany them to London, Dustin quickly declines the offer because he is seeing someone, but Zoey decides to think about it first. Although she treasures Chase's opinion, Chase had heard the rumor before Zoey gets a chance to tell him about the news. This leads Chase to bitterly convince Zoey that she should go to London, and she decides to leave PCA. Before she leaves she gives a sad moment saying goodbye to Lola, Quinn, Michael, Logan, Mark, Dustin, and Stacey. Chase, however, doesn't come to say goodbye. After she leaves, Chase starts hanging out with a girl named Gretchen, who looks a lot like Zoey. Logan, Michael, Lola, and Quinn all hate her. He later admits that he only did so because he missed Zoey. In a cliffhanger ending, due to a webcam malfunction, Zoey watches Chase confess his love for her when talking to Michael and Logan.
