Senthil Kumar ([[Prasanna  and Malini ([[Sneha  are a happily married couple in New Jersey, living life like any other born-in-India, arrived-in-the-US couple do. He submerges himself in the office and eats sambhar rice at home and she never misses a bhajan at the temple and shops at Indian stores. They have a daughter Rithika , 10 years old, the apple of their eyes  They have just settled down in a new, spacious home about which Malini, understandably, has fears. The couple squabble amicably about everything from her perpetual laundry and cooking; while Senthil argues with friends about the significance of viboothi  and takes his family on weekend trips and birthday parties. It is a normal, happy life in the US until Robertson  arrives, to paint the basement. Now, things are never the same at home again. Robertson's unusually kind behaviour towards children sets off warning bells in your head especially when he is shown to be a pedophile who exercises like mad within the confines of his home, always moving on towards his next target. How the couple save their child forms the rest of the story.
