Beauty consultants Sun and Aki are sent to their company's new branch in Shenzhang to be the branch managers. They discover later that their boss had lied to them and they are actually used by him to explore business opportunities in that region. They go to the disco after work and meet a strange man called Mr Cheng. Cheng requests their services for his wife, saying that it is inconvenient for her to travel to their centre. Sun takes up the offer and follows Cheng home because she is attracted by his wealth. However, she is shocked to discover that the Cheng couple are actually ghosts and she flees in horror. The Chengs are unhappy with Sun for discontinuing her service, because she had already accepted their "payment". They threaten Sun to fulfill her promise or else they will turn nasty. Meanwhile, the Lai brothers unknowingly opened a disco during the Hungry Ghost Festival and now they have attracted a large number of phantom patrons. Sun and the Lais seek help from Mrs Bud Lung, an expert ghostbuster, to deal with the spiritual beings.
