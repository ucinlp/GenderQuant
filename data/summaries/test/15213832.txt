After the gang wreaks havoc in the local cobblerâ€™s shop, the friendly cobbler takes them on a picnic, during which his old Model T breaks down. While the cobbler goes to the creek to fetch water for the radiator, the gang tries to do all sorts of repairs on the car, causing more problems. Mickey and Jack accidentally disturb the rest of a sleeping hobo, who tries to punish them by doing them serious bodily harm. After Buster the Dog chases the hobo off, the gang gets the car going again by rigging it with a sail and they sail off into the sunset.
