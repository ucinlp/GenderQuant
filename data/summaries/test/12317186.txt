"Hawayein-Winds Change But The Scars Of History Remain" is a film which emerges from the consequences of the Operation Blue Star & is based on the aftermath of Indira Gandhi’s assassination and the nationwide 1984 Anti-Sikh riots & the subsequent victimization of the people in Punjab  in the years that followed. This film depicts real life events & most of the situations shown in this film are authentic seen through the eyes of the central protagonist ‘Sarabjit’. It is the story of his journey from innocence to disillusionment, from being a simple, romantic, music loving student, to becoming one of the "most wanted terrorists" in the country. The Indian Government called them terrorists but many call them martyrs. This film is an honest exploration of the reasons which led to the angst of the youth of Punjab & the turmoils suffered by their families. It is the story of a time :- #When innocents were forced to rebel against injustice & labeled terrorists by the existing government. #When political motivations created terrorists out of common criminals. #When the nations watchdogs became greedy, heartless money-making murdererous machines. #When the sound of winds created unspeakable fear in the minds of people in Punjab. #A time created by an impotent administration & judiciary & the silence of the intelligentsia. #A time which saw the beginning of cross border terrorism in India. #It exposes the real reason of Pakistan participating in & actively aiding terrorism in Punjab. This film is the first of its kind subjects to be made and has been crafted within commercial parameters. The production values of this film are on par with most major commercial Bollywood films. It has been shot in more than 41 authentic & picturesque locations in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi & on massive sets in Kamalistan Studio- Mumbai.
