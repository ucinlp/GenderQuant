Veteran lawyer Rajinikanth has never lost a case in the court. He is a self made man with a rags to riches story. Hence he does not ask for favours from anyone, except in the aspiration of being appointed as a Judge/ Justice of supreme court, where he expects the Bar Council of the court to favour him. Kannan is his nephew who is brought up like a son by the childless Rajinikanth and his wife. Kannan was also played by Shivaji Ganeshan in a double role. Kannan is an antithesis of Rajinikanth, he is a god fearing, amiable, domesticated young man. Rajinikanth is shocked to know that an undeserving person has been promoted as supreme court judge. Meanwhile, Mohandas  murders his wife & beseeches lawyers to appear on his behalf & save him. Rajinikanth feels that the Bar council has not recognized his prowess in jurisprudence and decides to seek his revenge by gaming the system and fighting for Mohandas despite the latter's guilt. Mohandas is thus acquitted by the court, thanks to Rajinikanth's expertise in law. This deeply hurts Kannan who does not say anything at that time out of respect for his uncle. Under unnatural circumstances, Mohandas's fiance dies in the bath tub. Once again Mohandas is convicted. Once again, Rajinikanth appears on Mohandas's behalf. But this time around, Kannan protests and walks out of the house to become the prosecution lawyer facing Rajinikanth. Kannan defeats Rajinikanth due to his meticulous preparation and Rajinikanth's own failure to notice certain vital points in the case proceedings. With his very first defeat at the hand of Kannan proves too much to handle. An anguished Rajinikanth succumbs to death, just before the news of him being appointed as a judge is announced.
