Siva  is a happy-go-lucky young boy in a large family. The head of this family are 3 older brothers. One of the brothers, is the father of Siva. Siva studies from a hostel away from home. He is always helpful and always comes in when others need him. In one of his obliging acts he helps his cousin Kalpana  to elope with her lover against the family's choice. This aggravates the family and they are asked to forget all about him. On another occasion, he is asked to help a friend in a love marriage. Siva kidnaps Pooja  on a mistaken identity from the marriage hall. When Pooja is kidnapped, her uncles  and their henchmen follow them. Pooja while on the run tells Siva that she wasn’t interested in the wedding and her uncles are forcing her marriage with one of their sons only to seize her properties. When Siva went to kidnap her, she was thinking of how to run away from this marriage. While escaping from Pooja's uncles, Siva brings Pooja to his house under a false identity. Soon, Siva falls in love with Pooja and determines to marry her only with the consent of all the members of both families. When Siva's family along with Pooja visit a temple, her uncle kidnaps her and locks her away in his house. To save Pooja, Siva joins Emotional Ekambaram ([[Vivek  — the auditor of Pooja's uncles — as an assistant. He makes Ekambaram believe that he is capable of creating new worlds with characters of their own. Ekambaram then "creates" two American billionaires and with the help of Siva, convinces the two uncles to marry their sons to the daughters of these billionaires. To prove that they are real and not merely the figment of Ekambaram's imagination, Siva asks his parents and his uncles and aunts to play the role. They manage to win the Gounders' hearts and bring about a change in their behaviour. Then, with the consent of all the family members Siva marries Pooja.
