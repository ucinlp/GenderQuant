In 1944 a young woman, Livvy Dunne , who became pregnant before marriage, is sent to rural southeastern Colorado. Her father, Rev. Dunne , decides to deal with the situation by arranging her marriage to a shy farmer through another preacher. The groom, Ray Singleton , lives on a remote farm and is very different from Livvy. Ray focuses on what is close to him: his family, his land, and today. Livvy thinks on a much grander scale: the world, ancient civilizations, and faraway places.
