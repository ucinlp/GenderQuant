A struggling musician in Toronto, Jude Garland, 33, has developed feelings for a beautiful young woman whom he has never met, but only observed via the Internet. Disheartened, Jude is encouraged to track her down by his friend Victoria Fleming, a sly documentary filmmaker whose ulterior motives are only gradually revealed as the film progresses. His quest eventually takes him to Montreal where his friend Billy  introduces him to Raymonde, Jacklyn and Bertie, three musicians  with whom he will have three conversations about romantic love. Although clues abound that the beautiful young woman from the Internet is within his reach, Jude's frustration mounts as he discovers that his reality is anything but what it seems.<ref name1181 13 SOFIA INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL].
