A scientist named Dr. Sanjay Susra Mehra  creates a computer program from which he sends variations of the syllable Om into space, hoping to attract the attention of extraterrestrial life. When he believes he has finally gotten a response, the scientific community mocks him. While driving home, an alien spacecraft appears overhead. Dr. Mehra looks out the window, exclaims, "UFO!" and veers off the road. His pregnant wife  grabs the steering wheel, causing the car to hit a stone, flip over and explode. Dr. Mehra dies, but his wife, thrown out of the car, survives the wreck and returns home to India. When their son Rohit  is born, he is developmentally disabled. His mother raises him in the town of Kasauli, where he grows up to be a man of limited intellect and childish personality, but with a loving heart. Rohit has a number of much younger friends; loyal children who play with him. He befriends a young woman named Nisha . Nisha is sympathetic towards him and humors him, knowing about his mental disability from his mother, who chastises Nisha's suitor Raj for beating Rohit up. Rohit and Nisha find Sanjay's old 'Om' computer and summon the aliens by accident. The visiting aliens leave in haste, leaving one behind by accident. Rohit, Nisha and Rohit's friends find and befriend the alien, naming him Jadoo  when they discover his psychokinesis abilities. Jadoo discovers that Rohit is mentally subnormal, so he uses his powers to enhance the boy's mind. Rohit finds himself accepted by most of his peers. Raj and his buddies attempt to embarrass Rohit multiple times, only to be beaten in fights as well as in basketball, since Rohit's physical strength and agility was increased along with his mental abilities. Rohit and his young friends also receive a little help from the telekinetic Jadoo during the basketball game, with humorous results. Nisha and Rohit spend more and more time together and ultimately Rohit proposes to her, which she accepts. Jadoo's presence is kept secret from everyone but Rohit's friends and mother. The government however, never gave up in their search for aliens. Police capture Jadoo, who is then rescued by Rohit after he summons the aliens to return for Jadoo. Jadoo flees in his returned family's spaceship, apparently taking Rohit's new mental and physical powers with him. Rohit again is mentally disabled, which saves him from prosecution by the government. After everything dies back down, Jadoo returns and restores Rohit's new abilities permanently. Nisha and Rohit lead a happy life together from then on.
