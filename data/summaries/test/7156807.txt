The movie is about a normal family in a quiet rural French town that is taken hostage by two runaway bandits. Surprisingly, the family turns out to be not only cooperative but also very pleasant and understanding about their captor's predicament. As the movie progresses, it becomes apparent that none of the characters are who they seem to be. The two bandits are revealed to be only petty criminals and their escape, the unintentional result of a feud between the drivers of their convoy. As for the family, when the mother stabs the house maid to keep her from entering the house, they are revealed to not be as sane and innocent as they initially appeared.
