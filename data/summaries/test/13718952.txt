In 2035, the Earth population is on the verge of extinction because of global warming. The Earth Federation sends a space ship to the distant planet Trion which could be inhabitable for humans. The crew-members come from Russia, USA, China, the United Kingdom, France, and Saudi Arabia. The crew has spent 80 years in hibernation while their ship traveled at the speed of light. When they wake up, they find out that the Captain has been dead in his capsule for the last 75 years. The ship's Executive Officer, Commander Hollis, assumes command, but when he reads the secret message from Earth that was received through hyperspace while they were sleeping, he commits suicide, leaving a note that he "joins his family". The new Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Jammad, reads the message and learns that the Earth has been devastated in a nuclear holocaust. A fight for power ensues and Becker relieves Jammad from command. He is shortly found dead in a virtual reality simulator because of system malfunction, and the crew realize that someone has to be trying to kill them all. The suspicion falls on Becker and the remaining four crew-members arrest her, revealing in the process that she is an android. Becker denies any guilt and then activates the self-destruction sequence. Granier and Han are too devastated to continue and commit suicide with a morphine overdose, and Reese and Zinovitz run to the escape capsule. But when they enter the hatch, it is revealed that they are not really on a space ship but in an underground simulation complex on Earth. There was no space flight and the Captain was never dead, it all was a test scenario where the commanding officer is incapacitated. The crew have only been in hibernation for 6 months, and Hollis and Becker apparently knew about the test and were instructed to play along. However the nuclear war on Earth is indeed real, as was the suicide of Commander Hollis which was triggered by this event. The film ends with a view of a city devastated in a nuclear blast, as Reeves and Zinovietz look on to uncertain future.
