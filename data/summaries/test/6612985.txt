The plot begins on August 10 in a California drive-in theatre, and concerns a killer on the loose, with the victims beheaded with a large sword. Two policemen are sent to investigate the killings, and question the owner of the drive-in, his assistant and a local peeping Tom, before going undercover to catch the killer themselves.
