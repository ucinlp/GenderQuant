This is one of the cartoons that Warner would occasionally produce that featured few or none of its stable of characters, just a series of gags, usually based on outrageous stereotypes and plays on words, as a narrator  describes the action. This one is somewhat different in that Porky Pig  appears, as the zookeeper of the "Azusa Zoo". Some excerpts: *In a comic "triple", a timber wolf is shown, then a gray wolf, then a "Hollywood wolf" . *Other creatures include a "missing lynx", a "tortoise and the hair", "March hares" who march to a drumbeat, a down-on-his-luck "bum steer", an Indian elephant playing an American Indian, and a bald eagle wearing a toupee. *There is also a running joke about a lion who is awaiting the arrival of the ice cream truck.
