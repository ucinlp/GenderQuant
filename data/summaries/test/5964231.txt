In Mickey's Mellerdrammer Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Goofy , and the rest of the gang present their own low budget light hearted rendition of the 19th century Tom Shows for a crowd in a barn converted into a theater for the occasion. Horace Horsecollar plays the white slave owner Simon Legree, whip and all. Minnie plays the young white girl Eva. Mickey plays old Uncle Tom with cotton around his ears and chin, and the young slave girl Topsy. Clarabelle Cow plays the slave woman Eliza. Goofy plays the production stage hand. The cartoon opens with Mickey and Clarabelle Cow in their dressing rooms applying blackface makeup for their roles. The cartoon is much more focused on the Disney characters' efforts to put on the play, than an animated version of Uncle Tom's Cabin. The cartoon contains many images of Mickey and his gang using makeshift props, as light hearted sight gags. The cartoon closes with the characters coming out for a bow, and Horace Horsecollar's character is pelted with rotten tomatoes. When Goofy shows his face from behind the stage, he is hit with what appears to be a chocolate pie, leaving him in what appears to be blackface.
