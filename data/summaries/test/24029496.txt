{{POV}} After a bank robbery gone wrong, three brothers, on the run from the law, head for home, hoping their mother  can provide them with a getaway. The youngest brother, Johnny , has been shot and their back-stabbing former partner has gotten away with all the cash. But when the brothers get home, they find that all their stuff is gone and Mother is nowhere to be found. She lost the house months ago in a foreclosure. The new owners, Beth and Daniel Sohapi  and their guests, gathered for an ill-timed birthday party, become the brothers' unwitting hostages. Not long after, Mother arrives, along with the boys' sister Lydia , and it soon becomes clear that Mother will do absolutely anything to protect her children. In one terrifying evening, she brilliantly takes control of the situation and masterminds her sons' escape from the law. Sides will be taken, secrets revealed, and sins punished as the hostages struggle to survive.
