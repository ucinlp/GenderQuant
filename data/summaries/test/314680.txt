Dutch mystery writer Cornelius Leyden  is visiting Istanbul. A fan of his, Colonel Haki  of the Turkish police , believes he would be interested in the history of one Dimitrios Makropoulos , whose body was just washed up on the beach. Leyden is so fascinated by what Haki tells of the dead arch-criminal that he becomes determined to learn more. He seeks out Dimitrios's associates all over Europe, none of whom have a kind word for the deceased. They reveal more of the man's sordid life. His ex-lover, Irana Preveza , tells of his failed assassination attempt. Afterwards, he borrowed money from her and never returned. On his travels, Leyden meets Mr. Peters . Later, he catches Peters ransacking his hotel room. Peters reveals that he too had dealings with Dimitrios , and he is not convinced that the man is really dead. If he is indeed alive, Peters plans to blackmail him for keeping his secret. He generously offers Leyden a share, but the Dutchman is only interested in learning the truth. Nonetheless, the two men get along well together. Wladislaw Grodek  is the next link in the trail. He had hired Dimitrios to obtain some state secrets. Dimitrios manipulated Karel Bulic , a meek, minor Yugoslav government official, into gambling and losing a huge sum, so he could be pressured into stealing charts of some minefields. Bulic later confessed to the authorities and committed suicide. Meanwhile, Dimitrios double crossed Grodek, selling the charts to the Italian government himself. Eventually, the two men track Dimitrios down in Paris. Fearful of being exposed to the authorities, he pays Peters one million francs for his silence, but true to his nature, goes to Peters' home shortly thereafter and shoots him. Leyden, his rage over Peters being shot overcoming his fear, grapples with Dimitrios, allowing the wounded Peters to grab the gun. Peters sends Leyden away to spare him from witnessing the violence to come; then shots are heard. When the police show up, Peters admits to shooting Dimitrios and does not resist arrest, satisfied with what he has accomplished. As he is taken away, he asks that Leyden write a book about the affair, and to kindly send him a copy.
