Typical of Arriaga's works, this film is told in a non-linear narrative, where events are revealed out of sequence. The following plot summary is in chronological order, and thus does not reflect the exact sequence of the events as seen on screen. The story starts off some time in the mid-90's in a small New Mexico town near the border of Mexico, where we are introduced to Gina , a wife and mother to four children. Gina carries out an affair with a local man named Nick Martinez , who also has a family of his own, but unbeknownst to the two, Gina's teenage daughter Mariana  finds out about their love affair. Mariana follows her mother to Nick's trailer. Knowing the two are inside and in an effort to make them end their affair, she disassembles the gas pipe leading into the trailer, and sets it on fire. The flames eventually reach a gas tank that causes a fiery explosion, consuming the entire trailer and claiming both Nick and Gina's lives, although she had no intention of killing either of them. After their funeral, Mariana and Nick's own teenage son, Santiago , slowly begin to develop a relationship of their own. Mariana soon becomes aware that she is pregnant with Santiago's daughter. The two flee to Mexico amid disapproval from their families and decide to have the baby there, but after she has delivered their daughter, Mariana abandons her family and assumes the new name of Sylvia. Over a decade later, Sylvia  works at a high-end Portland restaurant. Despite her success, she resorts to promiscuity and has persistent thoughts of suicide. Here we see a mysterious figure following her around which was later connected to the crop dusting scene as a co-worker and close friend of the older Santiago. After an accident on a plane, the hospitalized Santiago urged Carlos to look for Sylvia who he's been searching for since she left their two-day old baby. Because Carlos  didn't speak English and Sylvia didn't speak Spanish, he couldn't explain to her the purpose of his visit. Instead, he surprised Sylvia with her now twelve year old daughter, Maria . Maria, who was reluctant to meet her estranged mother, was heartbroken when her mother abruptly left the scene. Sylvia, realizing later she made a mistake, enlisted the help of her friend, Laura, to search and finally found Carlos and Maria in a motel where they shut her out. Refusing to give up, Sylvia and Laura  booked a room across the way and Sylvia took her opportunity to reunite with her daughter as Carlos was packing up their car to leave. Sylvia managed to get through to Maria and agreed to go back to Mexico with them where she was confronted with more of her past, and with a heavily medicated Santiago. There, in private, she confessed to him her past crime of killing their parents, afraid that he wouldn't make it. She returned with Maria to the home that was revealed in the last scene as the home she had briefly shared with Santiago before kissing her newborn baby goodbye. In Maria's room alone, she saw a picture of a happy toddler Maria and the young Santiago--evidence of a good father. More important, there was a framed picture of her young self on the wall--the very picture that Santiago had asked for when they first started their courtship. Realizing her mistake, Sylvia ask for her daughter's forgiveness the next day. Even though Maria did not respond, she had included her mother at the hospital minutes later as she was approaching the room of her father, who was successfully recovering from surgery. In this last scene, we see Sylvia, actually the older Mariana, finally smiling and finally being able to face her past with a sense of hope for a happy future with Santiago and Maria.
