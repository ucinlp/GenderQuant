Kim  is a 15-year-old street orphan in Lahore of the 19th century . Kim thinks he is native, but he's actually of British origin, the son of an Irish soldier and an Indian mother. He is taken up as a guide by a travelling Tibetan lama  on a search for a river where Budda hurled an arrow, turning into a place of redemption. When he finds his father's regimen and the British military discover his origins and his real name, Kimball O'Hara, he's placed in an English college. His nature, however, is opposed to the regimentation expected for the son of a British soldier, and he rebels. His familiarity with Indian life and his ability to pass as an Indian child allows him to function as a spy for the British as they attempt to thwart revolution and invasion of India. Rejoining his holy man, Kim is trained by an Englishman called Babu  to become a British spy and receives orders from a British Colonel  who assigns him a risky mission in the Big Game, the behind-the-scenes struggle between Imperial Britain and Russia for supremacy in Afghanistan and Central Asia. He also befriends an astute Afghan horse-dealer named Mahbub Ali , a British Secret Service agent, who helps him with his task.
