This cartoon features Yosemite Sam and Bugs Bunny competing to see who can climb the Schmatterhorna pun on Walter Cronkite, and a reference to famed vaudeville comedians Smith & Dale's famous Dr. Kronkheit sketch. Krankheit, pronounced cronk-hite, means "sickness" in German. Instead, Yosemite ends up climbing the Eiffel Tower after a series of mountain climbing gags, to the sound of band music.
