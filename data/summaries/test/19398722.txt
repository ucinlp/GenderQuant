When open auditions are announced for a radio variety program, the local station is besieged by aggressively over-coached "professional kids." Also auditioning is an impressive-sounding musical aggregation called the International Silver String Submarine Bandâ€”which turns out to be none other than the gang, equipped  with home-made instruments. After suffering through an endless parade of cloyingly cute kiddie troupers , the gang step up to the microphone and steal the show with a truly unforgettable rendition of "The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze".
