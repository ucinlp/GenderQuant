Tired of the local Mexican villagers crowding around his display window to watch a running TV set, Daffy Duck  turns it off and declares that, to watch TV, they must come in and buy a set. Meanwhile, in a mousehole in his store, Speedy and his friends are celebrating his birthday. Unfortunately, one thing is missing: music. So Speedy goes into the main storeroom and turns on one of Daffy's radios. Daffy abruptly shuts it off, and thus, Speedy does everything in his power to have fiesta music at his party. With Daffy doing everything he can to stop him, even if it means going to the local radio station and holding up the radio DJ at gunpoint, forcing him to play bad Bill Lava music! Speedy races to the radio station and subdues Daffy by tying him up on a record player.
