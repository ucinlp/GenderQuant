Christmas Grace tells the story of two rival toy store owners competing for business over several Christmas seasons. One of them is Gary , a young toy store owner who runs an honest business and who tries to maintain a good reputation with his customers. Things are running smoothly for Gary until his business is threatened when a much larger toy company moves to the neighborhood. The owner of this larger company, Mr. Tollman , is a ruthless businessman who voraciously wants to grow his business and eliminate competition. Since his most immediate competition is Gary's store, he sets his target on him. As the story unfolds, it becomes very clear that God is at work in the lives of these two men, and God's grace and providence work out in ways neither of them could have imagined.
