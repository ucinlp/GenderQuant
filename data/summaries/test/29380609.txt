Lloyd the Conqueror is Lloyd, a lazy college student with big dreams for the future. Lloyd and his two best friends Patrick and Oswald desperately need to pass their Medieval Literature class in order to keep their financial aid. Our heroes are so desperate that they beg their teacher for extra credit work. Their professor, Derek, concedes but only on one condition: They must join his deteriorating LARPing league and battle against him in a game of Demons & Dwarves. Lloyd decides to enlist the help of Cassandra, ex-cage fighter and “Self Defense for Women” instructor in the battle against Derek, the long reigning champion who has been twisted to the dark side by his years of intense academic study. On their quest to victory the three students must match wits with a pack of crazed Danes whose bloodlust can only be sated by posting their LARPing victories online, the muscle bound Leopold who comes out of the Sanitarium to beat Lloyd and friends at the game he takes a little too seriously, and the stuck up Science Fiction Larper who would sooner break the prime directive than cut our heroes some slack. The journey forces Lloyd and the boys to do some actual work for once including throwing ‘magic’ tinfoil balls, deciding which household items are most effective in slaying trolls, and questioning society’s hero worship of George Washington Carver.
