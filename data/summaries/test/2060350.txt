The story takes place in 1903. During a train trip, psychiatrist Dr. Huntington Bailey  meets a friendly older lady . She tells him that she is going to visit her brother Nick and his lovely young wife Allida. Once in New York, Bailey hears that his train companion suddenly died. Shortly afterward, he meets the strange couple and becomes suspicious of Nick's treatment of his wife. Nick  keeps Allida , whom he is trying to pass off as crazy, a virtual prisoner in their London town house [a New York brownstone in the film], cutting off all contact with the outside world. The kindly Bailey takes it upon himself to attempt to free his new love Allida from the control of the insanely jealous Nick. A frenzied gun battle in their home features the destruction of several large aquariums, replete with shattered glass, gushing water and floundering fish may be the most memorable  scene in the film.
