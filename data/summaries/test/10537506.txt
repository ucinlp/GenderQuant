One morning, a schoolboy named John awakes to find an invisible giant sitting at the foot of his bed. John names him Ivor and soon the giant is playing tricks around the house: squirting John's father with a garden hose, disturbing the laundry hanging on the clothesline, and stealing food. Ivor can create music, and later he gives John an invisible seesaw ride in the park. But what Ivor really wants is to learn to write. He wants John to read him stories, and he wants to go to school with him. Ivor creates a great deal of mischief at John's school, writing rude words on the chalkboard. On the way home, Ivor incites the wrath of an angry mob after tempering with the Belisha beacons and pelican crossings.
