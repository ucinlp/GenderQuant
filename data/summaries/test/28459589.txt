Beatie Bow, a young Victorian-era girl, is summoned from the past to contemporary Sydney by children chanting her name. 16-year-old Abigail Kirk follows her back to 1873, in the colony of New South Wales. Beatie's family believe Abigail is the promised 'Stranger' who will arrive to save 'The Gift' for future generations of Bows. Abigail is trapped in the past until she does what she was 'sent' to do, even though she doesn't know what this is. During her sojourn, she falls in love for the first time and gains a more mature perspective on her parent's relationship.
