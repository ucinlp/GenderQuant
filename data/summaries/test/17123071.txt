In the aftermath of a global war, guns have been outlawed but people still fight, using blades and fists. Nicola the Woodcutter  is the most powerful man east of the Atlantic, a shadowy crime boss who rules with an iron fist and nine assassins called the Killers. His right-hand man is Killer No. 2 , a cold-hearted, smooth-talking murderer with a red hat and a deadly blade. Along with his killers is Nicola's love, Alexandra , a femme fatale with a secret past. The citizens live in fear of this gang and wait for the hero who can overthrow them. One night, a mysterious Drifter  enters the Horseless Horseman Saloon and talks to the Bartender . He wants two things: a shot of whisky and to kill Nicola. Soon, another stranger enters, a samurai named Yoshi . Yoshi wants to avenge his father by recovering a talisman that Nicola stole from his clan. Armed with crossed destinies and incredible fighting skills and guided by the Bartender's wisdom, the two eventually join forces to bring down the corrupt reign of Nicola. After a string of altercations which involve the Drifter and Yoshi injuring police officers and Nicola's goons, Killer No. 2 slays Yoshi's uncle  and kidnaps his cousin Momoko  to send her to Nikola's brothel. In retaliation, the Drifter, Yoshi, the Bartender and an army of freedom fighters invade Nikola's palace. As the Bartender rescues Momoko, he sees his long-lost wife Alexandra, but she disappears amidst the debris of the burning brothel. Meanwhile, after defeating Nikola's top killers, Yoshi faces Killer No. 2 and fatally stabs him while the Drifter advances toward Nikola, who injures him in the chest with a tomahawk. Despite his injury, the Drifter slashes Nikola's throat with an arrowhead taken from Yoshi while revealing his true motive of avenging his father's death. With Nikola's reign brought to an end and Yoshi recovering his clan's medal, the heroes part ways, hoping to meet each other again.Bunraku, Guy Moshe ,TIFF 2010 Films
