An updated version of the Sweeney Todd legend, this melodrama tells the tale of a murderous barber, Sweeney Todd, who supplies raw meat for his neighbor, Mrs. Lovett, who runs a pie shop. Amid the resulting carnage is a romantic sub-plot, although the film focuses mainly on the gore.Introduction to Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street edited by Robert L. Mack .
