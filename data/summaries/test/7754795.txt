Chicago Examiner reporter Hildy Johnson has just quit his job in order to marry Peggy Grant and start a new career when, shortly prior to his scheduled execution, convicted revolutionary Earl Williams escapes from death row in the Cook County Jail and secretes himself in a rolltop desk in the Criminal Court Building press room. In reality, Earl is an impoverished, bumbling leftist with a penchant for stuffing fortune cookies with messages demanding the release of Sacco and Vanzetti, but the yellow press of Chicago has painted him as a dangerous threat from Moscow and as a result the city's citizens are anxious to see him put to death. Mollie Malloy, the condemned man's girlfriend and a self-described "$2 whore from Division Street", reveals his hiding place to Hildy, who is unable to resist the lure of what could be the biggest scoop of his soon-to-be-over career in journalism. Ruthless, egomaniacal managing editor Walter Burns, desperate to keep Hildy on the job, encourages him to stay and cover the story. When Earl is in danger of being discovered, Mollie creates a distraction by leaping from the third-floor window, which she does survive with a few injuries. When Earl is caught, Hildy and Walter are arrested for aiding and abetting a fugitive but are released when they discover the mayor and sheriff had colluded to keep secret a last-minute pardon of Earl by the governor. Walter grudgingly accepts the fact he is losing his ace reporter and presents him with a watch as a token of his appreciation. Hildy and Peggy set off to get married, and Walter telegraphs the next railway station to alert them to the fact the man who stole his watch is on the inbound train and should be apprehended by the police.
