 Station Officer Steele  fires Elvis  as the station cook. It gives Fireman Sam  an idea. He invents Pancake Prototype One and a robot called Bentley  to be Elvis’ replacement. One day whilst spring-cleaning, Elvis decides to put Elvis Presley music in Bentley’s tape organism. He goes crazy and ends up breaking the stopcock and causes a flood in the whole fire station. When it’s all sorted, they start to have what Bentley’s cooked, bangers and mash. It turns out that Bentley isn’t a good cook after all and everyone decides that it should be Elvis again.  A few weeks later, the fire station crew start making a training film with Norman Price  as Trevor ’s gopher. Production of the training film begins. When James  and Sarah  arrive they are asked to be trapped in Jupiter’s garage. However, Norman secretly sets fire to old newspapers. Later Dilys  looks for treasure in the attic but the candle that is her torch sets fire in the house. When she’s getting rescued, she argues about not letting go of a valuable vase that she found and could be in danger of breaking and it ends up in Trevor’s hands.  On November 5, the crew are preparing for Bonfire Night whilst Norman is dressed as a tree and pinches Bella  and Dilys’ bottoms. His plan is foiled by some railings which he ends up getting stuck in. After the crew rescue him from the railings, Norman introduces his pet hedgehog which he calls Brian. Brian scampers into the bonfire and Norman panics to get him out. The crew setup the guy and light the bonfire but Norman who is searching for Brain is in danger of being killed. After he’s rescued, it’s revealed that Brain was a girl hedgehog and has just had babies. While Norman lets them off into their natural habitat, bonfire night is a success and everyone remembers.
