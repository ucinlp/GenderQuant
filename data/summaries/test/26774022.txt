 The story begins at the home of B.O. Skunk, which is propelled by many fans. B.O. washes under shower and dozes himself with expired perfume. Then, he goes out for a walk. The flowers are rotting and falling within him. As B.O. walks to the forest he sees a pretty squirrel which calls him closer. But when B.O. goes to squirrel, she runs out to her home and stays a sign "NO VACANCY". All point in this that B.O. haves a stinky smell from which everyone runs. B.O. then sees a pretty female rabbit. He first gives her a flower to smell, and then substitutes himself for smell. Female rabbit, in horror, runs in her hole and "zips" it. B.O. cries, doesn't knowing what to do. Then, Cupid appears and gives the skunk a book "Advice to a love-worn" by Beatrice Bare Fax. The first chapter says to try a great lover routine. B.O. then goes to another female squirrel, sitting on the branch and attracts her in the manner of Charles Boyer. All goes good until the squirrel feels the stinky smell of B.O. and runs out. B.O., thinking he kisses a squirell, kisses all the branch and then a sleepy owl. Owl falls onto ground. The second chapter says to try a balcony routine. B.O. dresses like Romeo and then climbs up the tree to female raccoon while singing a serenade. At first, raccoon is attracted by B.O. But, when raccoon feels the smell of skunk, she throws a pot on him. B.O. falls in a pond. Even fishes don't like B.O.'s smell and then they run away from the pond. Then, an big female rabbit goes to B.O., grabs him and wants to kiss B.O. But even she runs from his smell. The next chapter of book says "Swoon 'em!" B.O. then gets a Frank Sinatra suit and pours it to become more thicker. Then, B.O.-Sinatra sings a "Rhapsody in Pew" with really Sinatra's voice. All forest's females run to hear B.O.'s singing. All of them are swooned, and even an old female rabbit jumps in the air and yells "FRANKIE!" B.O. continue to sing with some gags and then ends to sing as all females are jump on him. But then, they all run out, having detected his smell. Despaired B.O. then wants to do a suicide, because no one loves him. But Cupid stops him and shows the last advise: camouflage! B.O. then sees a pretty fox and disguises himsef as a male fox. Then, B.O. whistles to the fox. Fox likes B.O. and she kisses him. B.O. is excited and then walks with Fox on trunk, lying horizontally above the river. B.O. and Fox then lose their balance on trunk and fall into river. Downcast B.O. thinks that now fox will run away from him, as the paint has washed out. But fox is a painted skunk too in reality, but female. Paint washes out of her, revealing her true appearance. The both understand they are both skunks, and kiss longly. Iris out, and B.O. throws the advice book out of scene while kissing with female skunk.
