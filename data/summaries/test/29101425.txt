The film opens with screen titles describing the anti-Catholic provisions of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico. Civil war erupts when newly elected Mexican president, Plutarco Elías Calles , begins a violent and relentless crackdown against the country's Catholic faithful. The film depicts the carnage by showing churches being set on fire, nuns subjected to extreme harassment, Catholic priests murdered and countless faithful peasants killed and then publicly hanged on telegraph poles. The story shifts to Father Christopher , a Catholic priest, who is ruthlessly murdered by the Federales . The killing is witnessed by a thirteen-year-old boy named José Luis Sanchez . Driven by anger and rage, José joins the rebels, or Cristeros , fighting against Calles. Their battle cry is "¡Viva Cristo Rey!" . The rebel leader, retired general Enrique Gorostieta , an agnostic, takes an interest in young José and the boy soon becomes his protégé. Later while fighting against the Federales, José is captured in a firefight and is tortured to force him to renounce his belief in God. When he resolutely defends his faith, he is executed. The next year Gorostieta is killed in a battle at Jalisco.
