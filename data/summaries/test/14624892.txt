The next morning, she tries to apologize for her behavior, but Jim is not interested in hearing an apology. Joan, who over the while falls in love with him, tries to win his affection, though Jim remains unmoved by any of her actions. Meanwhile, he is informed that he will lose his land if he does not make profit anytime soon.
