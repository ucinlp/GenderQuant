In pre-war Japan, Yumiko, an aristocratic lady, accompanied by her maid, travels to Tokyo to visit her brother. Unaware that her brother has become involved in anti-governmental activities and left the city, the two women are captured, raped and tortured by the military police. Two years later, during the war, the government confiscates Yumiko's estate, turning it into a torture chamber for the inquisition of prisoners. Yumiko and her maid are among those who are subjected to sexual indignities.<ref nameWeisser|firstYuko Mihara Weisser|title1998|publisherMiami|isbn 96â€“97|chapter= CRUELTY: BLACK ROSE TORTURE }}
