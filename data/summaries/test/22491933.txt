The Water explores the past, present and future of a family over 24 hours. Set in the middle of a cold beautiful winter, it explores the complex and intimate dynamic between loved ones, and loss with regret and anticipation. The story, told like a visual poem, unfolds in silence, in the faces of the characters and in the beauty of music, leaving questions about death, life and love.
