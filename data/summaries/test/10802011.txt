When modestly successful screenwriter Hudson Milbank descends into a strange mood in which he feels detached from the world around him and unable to connect with his surroundings, either physically or emotionally, he attributes it to a night of excessive cannabis use. His writing partner Tom is disturbed by the sudden change in Hudson's demeanor and urges him to seek psychiatric help. Dr. Townsend diagnoses his condition as depersonalization disorder and prescribes various medications, and when nothing seems to help Hudson consults Dr. Richmond, who also sees drugs as the solution. Hudson meets Sara, a beautiful young woman who finds him attractive and appealing and decides to introduce him to as many positive and compelling experiences as possible. Also trying to help him is yet another psychiatrist, Dr. Blaine, who initially resists his advances but ultimately has an affair with him before revealing she has serious issues of her own that require professional attention.
