It consists of six stories from the fairy tale tradition, all performed by the Muppet characters and narrated by Rizzo and Gonzo. They were previously the main characters in The Muppet Christmas Carol, performing a similar narrative role.  In this segment, Sandy Pig  must protect her two na√Øve brothers  from a big bad wolf and his various attempts on their lives and homes.  King Midas  spares the life of a Satyr . When King Midas wants world peace, Queen Midas  wanted money and is granted the Golden Touch. When Queen Midas accidentally turns King Midas to gold, the Satyr tells Queen Midas that the effects of the Golden Touch can be undone if Queen Midas renounces her interest in gold.  The repeated overreactions of a young shepherd  cause villagers to doubt his word, even when the threat of a wolf is near. When the wolf actually shows up and nobody answers the shepherd's actual cries for help, the sheep enlist their larger cousin Norman who ends up crushing the wolf. The mayor  gives Gonzo a medal for "not crying wolf except when an actual wolf was present".  Miss Piggy plays a miller's daughter who is brought into the services of the King  where she must spin straw into gold as claimed by her attention-wanting father  or she'll be locked up in the dungeon. She ends up receiving the assistance of Rumpelstiltskin . She is forced by fate to give up her firstborn in return for the desperately needed services of Rumpelstiltskin.  The Emperor of Fozzalia  is fooled into believing that his vestments are made of an invisible cloth made by some tricksters . When Fozzie goes out to show his new clothes, a young boy  notices that the Emperor is wearing nothing but his boxers. The citizenry think that since the Emperor isn't wearing clothing and that public nudity must be the latest fad. The Emperor tells his people that they should stop doing things just because he does them, and that they should start thinking for themselves.  A shoemaker  and his nephew  face ruin until the Shoemaker's livelihood is saved by a group of philanthropic entertainers . Unfortunately, they can only make blue swede shoes. NOTE: During this story, Rizzo walks onstage to speak to Kermit and Robin about a gift to give the Elvises. As Steve Whitmire was already performing Kermit, he could not puppeteer for Rizzo at the same time and Rizzo's voice is recognizably that of Dave Goelz.
