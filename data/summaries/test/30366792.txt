After rounding up a large herd of horses, Gene Autry  receives a telegram from his brother Tex , who is mining diamonds in South Africa. The message states that Tex and his partner, Edward Barclay, have discovered a big strike in the Valley of Suspicion and urges Gene to bring as many horses as possible to Dunbar, South Africa, wher he can contact John Cardigan , the saloon owner who staked Tex and Barclay. Gene and his sidekick Frog  quickly arrange for passage overseas and accompany the horses to South Africa. Meanwhile Tex and his partner, while on their way back to Dunbar from their mine, are ambushed by Cardigan's men. Barclay is killed and Tex is able to escape. Cardigan wants sole control of the mine. Sometime later, Gene and Frog arrive at Dunbar and hire Barkey McCuskey, a small-time English con artist, as their auctioneer for when they sell their horses. Worried that Tex is not in Dunbar, Gene stoutly defends his brother when Cardigan tells him he is being sought for the murder of Barclay. Gene grows suspicious of Cardigan when he sees that the saloon owner tampered with another telegram from Tex. Cardigan in turn grows jealous as Gene who becomes friendly with saloon singer Gwen , who is Barclay's daughter. The next day Gene sees Cardigan's servant Namba  at the auction wearing the belt buckle that Gene gave to Tex, and Gene becomes more suspicious of Cardigan, whose henchman, Craig Johnson , plans to kill the Texans that night. Johnson arranges to have Gene and Frog arrested after he gives uncut diamonds to Frog in return for a horse. The police explain that it is illegal to have uncut diamonds without a license. The next day, while the police take Gene and Frog to Kimberly for trial, the Texans manage to escape. Later they find Cardigan as he is making his way through the jungle with Johnson, Gwen, and Barkey in search of the diamond mine. The group is captured by natives and brought before Chief Bosuto . Just as they are about to be sacrificed, Frog wins the chief over by teaching his children to sing. The chief agrees to let the others go if Frog stays behind to teach his children more music. Frog and Cardigan stay with the natives while Gene, Barkey, and Gwen are led away by Namba. After the police arrive and free Cardigan, and head to Cardigan's jungle hideout, where Tex is beling held a slave. Gene arrives and frees his brother and the other workers. Cardigan and Johnson attempt to escape, taken Gwen as a hostage, but Frog catches up with Johnson and Gene fights with Cardigan, who falls from a cliff to his death. The police arrive and capture the rest of Cardigan's gang. Later on the ship returning to Texas, while Frog sings along with Bosuto's children, Gene and Gwen kiss.
