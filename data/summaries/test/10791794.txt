The movie revolves around the trials and tribulations of Anu . Anu is a happy-go-lucky girl head-over-heels in love with her boyfriend. Her life changes when her father gets transferred to Mumbai . Her love life falls apart as her boy friend doesn’t respond to any of her letters. In addition, her father becomes seriously ill. Her father’s office colleague, Ramanathan , becomes a great source of strength for her in these tough times. Soon, he asks for her hand in marriage. She accepts gratefully, and confesses that she had a boyfriend, who has seemingly forgotten her. However, she soon realizes the truth about Ramanathan. He is a sadistic and jealous husband, who tortures her no end and, not unsurprisingly, she opts for a divorce. As a divorced woman, with an infant in her hands, she lands in Chennai  to take up a new job and start a new life. Her life takes a turn for the better in Chennai as she has a very supportive friend-group in her office, particularly a widower, Janardhan . Janardhan, or Johnnie as he is popularly called, is a talented ventriloquist who “talks” through his puppet, Junior. He falls in love with Anu, but is unable to muster up the courage to tell her about it. In an interesting cinematic twist, her ex-husband’s mother discovers her presence in the city and takes up a job as a maid in her house. Anu also stumbles upon her old lover in Chennai and discovers that her letters to him never reached as they were intercepted by his mentally-challenged sister. Soon, Anu renews her relationship with her old love and life seems to be looking up for her. But the ghosts of the past continue to haunt her. Ramanathan comes to Chennai in the role of her boss – a contrite and repentant Ramanathan, who now wants to re-marry Anu and redress the wrongs he had done. The situation becomes piquant with 3 men vying for Anu – her ex-love, her ex-husband and a silent lover lurking on the sidelines. Which way will Anu go? K. Balachander takes the movie to its logical, yet completely radical and unexpected, end.
