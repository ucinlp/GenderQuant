In 1849, Huckleberry Hound rides west on his "faithful horsie" hoping to start up a country farm. His journey takes him to the small town of Two-Bit, California, where the Dalton Gang are terrorising the townsfolk. As Huck approaches the town, the Daltons race past him and take his possessions. Entering the saloon, Huck tries to buy a drink with a large gold nugget. Seeing this, the Daltons coerce Huck into playing poker. The stakes are Huck's gold for the return of his stolen possessions. Huck accuses them of cheating, so they challenge him to a fight in a boxing ring. Huck finally wins. Huck goes to deposit his nugget in Quick Draw McGraw and Baba's bank, where he wins a prize of his choice. Being partial to its blue ink, Huck selects the fountain pen. Shortly the Daltons rob the bank, stealing Huck's nugget and pen. Soon an emergency town meeting is taking place to discuss what to do about the Daltons, now that Stinky has broken out of jail. Fearing for his life, Hokey quickly decides to appoint Huckleberry as the new sheriff. Sheriff Huck goes after the three Dalton Brothers and, after a number of confrontations and receiving injuries, he successfully jails them. After a celebration, Huck is ushered to run from Stinky, but he decides to face him anyway, while townsfolk flee for Tahiti. Stinky arrives on schedule and tries unsuccessfully to kill Huck. Stinky decides to get help by breaking his brothers out of jail by disguising himself as their grandmother. The Daltons start their revenge against Huck, which on first attempt, Huck is able to evade but after a long chase to the ends of the earth, they launch Huck on a rocket and he is presumably blown up in the sky. With Huck out of the way, the Daltons are free to go on a crime spree, becoming the richest outlaws in the west and rename Two-Bit as Daltonville. The Two-Bit townsfolk return to find this sight that greets them and learn what happened to Huck, before they are thrown out of town by the Daltons on a freight train, knowing that they've only themselves to blame for what's happened to their town and to Huckleberry. Meanwhile, at a campsite of a tribe of Native American hounds, the chief's daughter Desert Flower discovers the crashed rocket and Huck; still alive. Huck awakens, but has amnesia. Desert Flower calls him 'the mysterious blue hombre with amnesia'. The two of them quickly fall in love. Huck proposes to Desert Flower, but first Huck has to undergo a two-part initiation test to join the tribe for the chief's approval. He passes the first test, but fails the second test. Before Huck is forced to pay the "penalty", Desert Flower falls in the river and is swept toward a waterfall. Acting quickly, Huck jumps in and rescues her. Grateful and impressed, the chief gives his blessing for the two of them to marry. The wedding ceremony is interrupted by Huck's horse, who's finally found his master. The horse restores Huck's memory urges him to take care of "unfinished business" with the Daltons. Promising to return and marry Desert Flower, Huck rides off on his faithful horsie Bob. He finds the Two-Bit townsfolk at their own unsuccessful circus and urges them to help him defeat the Daltons. Back in Daltonville, as the Daltons are enjoying their success, they are shown a movie film made by Huck and the others saying that the ghost of Huckleberry Hound is coming back to Daltonville on a midnight ghost train. The Daltons are scared, but Stinky refuses to be intimidated. Wearing his disguise, Huck arrives in Daltonville in a green painted train rigged with special effects. Huck succeeds in terrifying the Daltons, even Stinky. The Daltons give in and but then they refuse to be brought to jail.The Two-Bit townsfolk, chase after them, and the Daltons run into what they think is their secret hideout, but is actually the state prison in disguise. Huck is awarded on capturing the Daltons, his friends also credited and they all go home to enjoy their victories, especially Huck married with Desert Flower.
