Blood will tell is a sci-fi horror film set in 16th Century Holland. A mysterious visitor who is hopelessly sick, attempts to hide from death in a dark, mosquito infested well. But the darkness canâ€™t hide him, or the surrounding villages for very long as the mosquitoes suck the blood of a mysterious visitor before turning their sights on a group of children playing outside in an idyllic landscape.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1408354/plotsummaryhttp://www.telefilm.gc.ca/05/slamdance2008.asp
