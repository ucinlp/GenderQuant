{{plot}} After a random attack the night before by a local gang known as "The Scullions" and their infantile leader Zed McGlunk  , Chief Henry Hurst  arrives at the 16th precinct and notifies its captain, Pete Lassard  that the precinct is the worst in the city. Nevertheless, Hurst gives him 30 days or else Lassard is out. Before he leaves, Lieutenant Mauser  schemes his way into talking to Hurst. Hurst promises him the rank of captain should Lassard fail. Pete calls his brother Eric  and asks him for six new recruits, as was promised by Hurst. Throughout the movie, Mauser is seen scheming with his dim-witted partner Sgt. Proctor  as he attempts to take control of the precinct. Carey Mahoney , Larvell Jones , Eugene Tackleberry , Moses Hightower , Laverne Hooks , and Douglas Fackler  join the 16th precinct, and some are assigned a veteran officer partner since they are rookies: Fackler has Dooley , Mahoney has Vinnie Schtulman , and Tackleberry has Sgt. Kathleen Kirkland . At first, Tackleberry disapproves of his partner, Kirkland, because of the fact she's a woman, but they later hit it off when they compare their preference of gun choices. Tackleberry later confides to Mahoney that he may have fallen in love with her. He also confides he is still a virgin. Mahoney and Schtulman spot a robbery at a merchant's place , but the robbers escape through a back door before Mahoney and Schtulman even enter the shop. Eventually Fackler, Tackleberry and Kirkland arrived, each one contributing in his own characteristic way to the destruction of the store. Mauser is ready to suspend them, but Mahoney makes a passionate plea that convinces Lassard to give them another chance. While all this is going on, Zed and his gang go shopping in a supermarket. They cause havoc as they go, leaving the store with wagon-loads without paying and Mr. Sweetchuck is already at hand in the supermarket to be further tormented this time by Zed & co. Mauser gives Mahoney a new assignment; patrolling a tunnel, covering him and his partner with soot in the process. He gets revenge on Mauser by switching his shampoo with Tackleberry's epoxy resin solution, which glues his hands to his hair. He ends up embarrassing himself in front of the station, and has to wear a wig through the remainder of the film. On his morning drive to the station the next day, Pete Lassard spots some of Zed's men and tries to deal with them, but is eventually over-powered and spray-painted. After his rousing speech to finish what they started, the whole gang is riled up. Progress is made and most of the gang is captured , but Mauser informs the captain that most of the charges were dropped. Mahoney sees that Mauser did this on purpose, so as revenge has a full body cavity search done on him . Tackleberry goes on a date with Kirkland, where they stay out late dancing. They profess their love for each other and have sex . Pete goes to see his brother Eric at a Japanese steakhouse, and Eric comes out with an idea to hold a fair. At the night of the fair though, Zed's men trash the place. Lassard is out of a job the next day, while Mauser is promoted Captain. His first act is to remove Mahoney and Schtulman, who is quick to object to Mahoney's dismissal. Mahoney, Schtulman, and Lassard get together in an last-ditch attempt to stop the gang. They send in Mahoney undercover to find the leader of the gang.  Lassard and Schtulman wire him, using duct tape and a radio microphone. Under the guise of "Jughead," he is able to infiltrate the gang and find out both their hiding spot and the name of their leader. His cover is blown however due to the radio microphone cutting into a baseball game, which leads to Lassard calling every man to the location. Mauser intervenes, but takes Fackler through the air duct. However, Fackler accidentally bumps him and pushes him inside. The police arrive and arrest every gangmember there. Zed escapes with Mahoney, but Lassard arrives and prepares to shoot Zed with a loaded pistol. Mahoney punches him down a flight of stairs, while Hooks arrests him. It is then revealed that Lassard's gun wasn't loaded, as he "never carried live ammo since '73". The film ends with the officers attending Tackleberry and Kirkland's wedding. They drive off the Police Academy lot in the monster truck BIGFOOT #3.
