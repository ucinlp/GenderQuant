The film tells a story of Mariana, a depressed nurse working in Lisbon. She accompanies an immigrant worker in a comatose sleep on his trip to home. After she arrives in Cape Verde, she encounters the strange and enigmatic world. The devoted Portuguese nurse took a journey only to find herself lost in abstract drama. There she finds that "she brought a living man among the dead." Quoted from the distributor's official synopsis: http://gemini-films.com/catalogue/casadelava_us.htm The director Pedro Costa made the film in a minimalist style. Some ominous, poetic imageries of local people and Mount Fogo, the highest active volcano of Cape Verde, are used as esoteric metaphors of the heroine's isolation. For instance, the eerily first images are of Mount Fogo's volcanic eruption and the lava flowing on its surface, preluding this film about solitary life with juxtaposition of silent volcanic eruption and locals' close-up shots accompanied by ominous music.
