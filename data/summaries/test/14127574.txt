After discussions and dishonest negotiations, a decision is made as to where a large new chemical factory is to be built. Stefan Bednarz , an honest Party man, is put in charge of the construction. Bednarz used to live in the small town where the factory is to be built, and his wife used to be a Party activist there. Although he has unpleasant memories of the town, Bednarz sets out to build a place where people will be able to live well and work well. His intentions and convictions, however, conflict with those of the townspeople who are mainly concerned with their short-term needs. Disillusioned, Bednarz gives up his position.
