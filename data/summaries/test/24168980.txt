In a typical Tokyo High School a perpetually teenage vampire named Monami  falls for her classmate, Mizushima , who happens to already be the reluctant boyfriend to the vice-principal/science professor's daughter, Keiko , a leader of a Sweet Lolita gang. The ensuing love triangle leads Keiko to seek the assistance of her father who, unbeknown to his daughter, moonlights as a Kabuki-clad mad scientist with the school nurse as his assistant. The pair experiment on students in the school basement hoping to discover the secret of reanimating corpses . Their hopes are answered when they discover a solution of Monami's blood holds the properties to bring life to dead body parts and inanimate objects. The story begins to unfold after Mizushima carelessly accepts a honmei choco spiked with Monami's blood, causing him to become a half vampire. When Keiko discovers their secret, she attacks Monami but accidentally throws herself off the school roof in the process. Her premature death leads to her father using the blood solution to transform her into a vicious Frankenstein's monster determined to get revenge against Monami. From then on Monami and Keiko battle each other in the pursuit of winning Mizushima's heart, regardless of his feelings towards either of them. Monami ultimately kills Keiko by using her powers to turn droplets of her blood into spikes that rip the flesh off the latter's body and leaves her skeleton impaled at the top of Tokyo Tower. At the end Keiko's father turns himself in a Franken Advanced Composite Life Form with use of Monami's blood.
