At the end of the last century on the north European coasts, lived men who feared neither God nor the law. They lured ships towards the rocks where they were smashed to pieces. These men then plundered the wrecks. They were called wreckers. The Captain is their leader; he is an evil man, his strength gives him power over his henchmen. He has committed so many crimes that he has become almost mad. Villagers say he is haunted by the ghosts of his victims. His madness makes him dangerous and unpredictable. Le Bosco is one of his henchmen; he is cursed by all navies, the bad seed of the crew. He landed there dead drunk from a ship one night, with his bad on his shoulder, he follows the captain, but this sailor, never without his knife, hates taking orders. He bides his time like a vulture. He is false and crafty. Paul is the captain's other henchman. He is a former sailor, he suffers the captain's orders but grovels to Le Bosco, he will be on the winner's side. He is cruel and cowardly and has a worse temper that the others. He is strongest because each of the three thinks he's on their side. Tina, the wrecker. The angel of the accursed. Wild and perverted. This cruel animal is always ready to snap up the innocent who come too close to her she-wolf jaws. She will show no pity. It is a game for her to plunder wrecks and kill survivors. More than one dead man, his throat cut, takes with him the image of her magnificently shameless naked body. When two young women accidentally stumble upon these wreckers, they brutally and violently rape them. The next day the captain thinks that he is going insane when he sees the women's dead bodies; he wrecks a tavern and gets into a fight with Le Bosco. The captain, Tina, Le Bosco and Paul go back to the wreck to kill the women but they manage to escape. Wandering around they come across a clown who looks after them. The woman are unable to speak but a man tells them he can help them, they communicate with a drawing and the man realises they want revenge. The woman are the only one who can free the devil from being imprisoned in the ruins of an old castle, by making love to each of them they will have the power to get their revenge. The women, now the d√©moniaques return for their revenge. At the beach they are again attacked by the captain and Le Bosco who tie them to the wreck. The captain goes mad and kills Tina and Le Bosco; realising what he has done is wrong, but unable to save them, the tide comes in and they all drown.
