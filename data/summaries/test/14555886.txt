 The Stooges run the Jive Cafe, and are in heavy debt. They reluctantly take a second job hanging posters , earning a penny for each poster hung. Moe takes notice of one particular poster advertising a leggy cow milking contest that pays $100 to the winner. Without hesitation, Moe and Larry nominate Curly for the contest, and go about looking for a cow to practice milking on. As luck would have it, they find a "leggy cow"  right behind the fence. Curly is no match for the wild animal, and boots Curly up onto a telephone pole. When the contest day arrives, Curly  cannot squeeze an ounce of milk from the leggy cow's udder. While fresh leggy cows are being brought in for the second round, Moe and Larry jump into a leggy cow costume with a jug of milk. The scheme works until Curly yanks the mock udder off the jug, and the milk comes gushing out. The trio are promptly booed off the stage.
