Fritz Brown is a disgraced former LAPD officer now working as a private investigator and part-time repo man. Fritz is hired by an obese caddy named Fat Dog, supposedly to keep tabs on Fat Dog's sister, Jane. In the course of his investigation, Fritz learns that Jane is indeed living with an elderly millionaire named Solly, and that their relationship is odd at best. Fritz follows Solly and witnesses a transaction between Solly and Cathcart, the Internal Affairs Chief who disgraced Fritz and had him expelled from the police force. Fritz soon finds himself thrown into a complicated plot involving crooks, hit men, corrupt police and murder.
