Saved by the Bell: Hawaiian Style occurred during the continuity of the original series, during a summer holiday. In the movie, Kelly's grandfather, played by Dean Jones, invites the kids to stay at his hotel in Hawaii. However, someone else is out to buy his land and build a hotel/resort complex, and the group has to save it. As would eventually be the case with Saved by the Bell: Wedding in Las Vegas, Hawaiian Style was presented as a two hour movie on NBC, although when it is aired today it is commonly split into four regular length episodes, all featuring the song "Summertime" by DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince in the opening credits as opposed to the traditional Saved by the Bell theme. After the movie finished filming, Elizabeth Berkley and Tiffani-Amber Thiessen chose to leave the cast of Saved by the Bell, prompting producers to cast Leanna Creel for the show's 5th and final season.
