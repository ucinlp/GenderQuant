The first scenes of the film take part in modern-day Havana, Chico, a shoe-shiner ends his day and goes up to his room that overlooks the port. He listens to the radio that plays a romantic arrangement of Bésame Mucho, which won a radio contest some 60 years back by performers Chico and Rita. The film then changes back to 1948 and finds Chico and his friend Ramón living as struggling dandies in a low-life bar where they are paired with two American tourists. The musicians at the bar play a ballad with their lead singer, Rita. Chico is immediately taken with her and he wishes to talk to her, but she is already busy with her own American tourist who will not let her leave. Chico and Ramón go to the Tropicana Club with their lady-friends, where they sneak in through the performer’s entrance. While walking around Chico stumbles upon Rita and her gentleman-friend almost initiating a fight but the Maitre d' overhears that Chico is an accomplished pianist and takes him backstage, since the main event of the evening is missing the pianist and he fills in playing at first sight a new piece by Igor Stravinsky. Chico, initially nervous, ends up performing the piece with aplomb, to the delight of the band. Rita finally agrees to flee with Chico in Ramón’s motorcycle along with the Americans, ditching her own John. After a dangerous chase, the American man finally crashes into a car dealership, giving the others plenty of time to escape. Rita and Chico take their leave from the rest of their party and go to a bar where Chico introduces her to bebop music, which she takes up very quickly; afterwards they go to Chico’s place and spend the rest of the night together. The next day Rita wakes up to find Chico playing a new composition on the piano, which he names “Rita”. As they play and kiss, Juana, Chico’s former girlfriend walks in and ends up in a fight with Rita after which both women leave angrily. Chico is taken with Rita and does not want to play in an upcoming contest if it not with Rita, so Ramón, who also is his agent, tracks Rita down and pays her to participate in the contest. After the performance is over, Rita leaves and Chico follows her in Ramón’s motorcycle. He sees that she enters a house where he believes that she lives with a man, but as it turns out it is the house of a santera that had predicted she would cause him much suffering. That night the contest winners are announced, and Pico and Chico win. The prize is a month’s engagement at the Hotel Nacional. A few weeks later, Chico and Rita are having great success during their performances and Rita’s beauty mesmerizes more than one man, which ignites Chico’s jealousy. One of the admirers, Ron, asks Rita to his table to discuss business. He offers to take Rita to New York City to make her a star, where jazz and Latin music are a burgeoning scene. While Ron tries to convince Rita to go to New York, she insists that the offer must include Chico, as well. Meanwhile, Chico has been watching from a distance and is extremely jealous, believing Rita wishes to leave him for Ron. Rita stands up to talk to Chico but he is already too drunk to understand and leaves in a rage. Even after this Rita insists that the offer should include both. Rita leaves and looks for Chico and goes to his place and waits in the courtyard where she falls asleep. She's awakened by the sound of Chico, completely drunk and barely able to walk, assisted by Juana. She leaves for New York alone as the new lover of Ron. Chico is depressed but he manages to get enough means to go to New York as well to find fortune. While there he finds Rita and manages to see her but she has become very successful and wishes not to see him again. Chico and Ramón deliver a letter of recommendation that they have received from Chano Pozo’s sister in Cuba which they hope will turn out to be a huge opportunity for them. Chano is receptive and excited to meet them; however, he is involved in drugs and has a short temper. After discovering that he was sold oregano instead of marijuana, Chano attacks his dealer only to be shot and killed by him a while later. In turn, Chico finds work as a party musician and Ramón as an usher at the Plaza Hotel. While at one of his gigs in a party, Chico runs into Rita again, who is flustered by the fact that a white woman has expressed her doubts about having a film made that features a black latino woman as a lead. Chico and Rita run away in her new car that she just got as a gift from Ron. The next day she leaves for California to film the movie. In the meantime Ron has located Ramón and proposes a deal to finance his artist-agency business, as long as he finds jobs to keep Chico away from Rita. Ramón complies with his end of the bargain and signs Chico with Dizzy Gillespie, who has a gig in Paris and then a European tour. All the while, Rita has become a big star and her film is a huge success. Chico has found a new girlfriend in Paris with a small dog; one morning, while playing “Rita” at the piano, the dog comes in and sits by Chico, who then changes the name of the song to “Lily”, the dog’s name. A few months pass on and Rita is sad despite all her wealth and success, since she is still mistreated socially due to her skin color. While being driven to a set and going through her lines, the radio plays a song she instantly recognizes and is moved to tears but is a bit disappointed to hear that the newest jazz-hit is known as “Lily”. Sometime later, while playing in a bar, Rita comes in and sees Chico playing “Lily”. After the performance is over and as Chico is ready to leave home, he comes across Rita, who asks him about this “Lily”, he teases her about the identity of the mystery female but finally reveals that the song is named after a dog. The two passionately kiss, which is caught in a photograph by a paparazzo, and agree to marry that New Year’s Eve after Rita’s debut in Las Vegas. Chico tells Ramón, who is alarmed that their union shall mean his own ruin and he slips in Chico’s coat a pack of drugs which are discovered during a police search during his own gig in Las Vegas. Chico is arrested and deported for Cuba, all the while Rita is waiting in her motel. She keeps drinking and when it is time for her performance, she denounces racism, virtually ending her career. When entering Cuba, Chico’s passport is held by the new Cuban revolutionary authorities and is forbidden to play jazz because it is capitalist music. Disappointed with life, Chico gives up music all together. Sixty years pass and while shining shoes for a tourist a young man rushes to Chico and tells him that some music big shots are asking very eagerly for him. He reluctantly agrees to go to the recording studio. For the first time in years he plays “Lily” and the singer asks him to join him recording that song which becomes a big hit and takes him in a world tour. After he ends his tour, Chico is allowed again into the United States and he searches for Rita, he finds Ron in a nursing home and discovers that his friend Ramón has died but no clues as to Rita’s whereabouts until he goes to Vegas, he knocks on Rita’s door, who has stayed for 47 years in the same motel room waiting for him.
