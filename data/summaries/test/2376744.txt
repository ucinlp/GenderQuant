Ryu , is a deaf-mute man working in a factory to support his ailing sister , who is in desperate need of a kidney transplant. As Ryu is not a match, and he is laid off from his job, Ryu contacts a black market organ dealer, and agrees to exchange his savings and one of his own kidneys in exchange for a matching one; the dealers perform the operation, but disappear after taking Ryu's kidney and money. Three weeks later, Ryu learns from his doctor that a donor has been found, but Ryu is unable to afford the operation now. In need of money for the operation and in retaliation for his being fired, Yeong-mi , Ryu's radical anarchist girlfriend, conspires they kidnap Yu-sun, the daughter of factory executive Dong-jin. The girl stays with Ryu's sister, who believes Ryu is merely babysitting her; concurrently, Ryu and Yeong-mi collect the ransom from Dong-jin. After collecting the money, Ryu finds his sister discovered his plan, and that she committed suicide as she was unwilling to be involved or to burden Ryu. Ryu takes Yu-sun and his sister's body to a suburban riverbed they used to frequent as children; while Ryu buries his sister, Yu-sun accidentally slips into the river and drowns. As Dong-jin mourns his daughter, he hires an investigator to help find Yu-sun's kidnappers, and realizes those he laid off may seek revenge. Meanwhile, Ryu locates, ambushes and murders the organ dealers. Dong-jin, receiving help from several sources, finds Yeong-mi and interrogates her; Yeong-mi apologizes for Yu-sun's death, but warns him of an organization she is part of that will find and kill Don-jin if he kills her. Dong-jin, unfazed by Yeong-mi's threats, electrocutes her to death. Ryu returns to Yeong-mi's apartment building and discovers the police removing her corpse. Ryu and Dong-jin wait at each other's residence in an attempt to kill the other; Ryu is the first to return home and, unaware of an electric booby trap on his doorknob, is rendered unconscious. Dong-jin binds Ryu and returns him to the riverbed where Yu-sun died. After binding Ryu's hands and feet and bringing him chest-high into the water, an emotional Dong-jin acknowledges that although Ryu is a good man, he has no choice; Dong-jin then slashes Ryu's Achilles tendons, resulting in his drowning. Dong-jin drags Ryu back to shore and begins to dig a hole, but soon a group of men arrives. They surround and stab Dong-jin repeatedly, finally attaching a note to his chest identifying themselves as the terrorist group of which Yeong-mi was part. The group leave Dong-jin dying beside his car with the bloody tools and bags containing Ryu's body.
