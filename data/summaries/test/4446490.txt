Two unrelated young girls who happen to look identical suddenly meet. Amanda Lemmon  is an orphan, and she is about to be adopted by the Butkises, a family whom she doesn't like. She actually wants her child-loving case worker Diane Barrows  to adopt her instead. She would like to do so, but authorities will not let her because of her low salary. Alyssa Callaway  is coming home from her boarding school's piano recital competition, only to find that her wealthy father Roger  is about to marry Clarice Kensington  a socialite who  hates kids and baseball, which Roger adores. The girls switch places and find out that Roger and Diane would fit together perfectly. So they arrange "chance" meetings with the desired result: they fall in love with each other. After some turbulences, Alyssa  ends up being adopted by the Butkisses. She and Diane  find out the only reason they have adopted so many kids was for them to work in their salvage yard. When Clarice secretly spies on Roger and Diane, she decides to move up the wedding from the next month to the next day. After Amanda, who poses as Alyssa, proves to the family butler Vincenzo  who she really is at the church, he summons to have the real Alyssa picked up from the Butkisses' salvage yard to stall the wedding. Once she and Diane show up, Roger stops the wedding and tells Clarice that he fell in love with Diane. Furious, she slaps him and prepares to do the same to both Amanda and Alyssa but is stopped by both Vincenzo and Diane. She storms out, embarrassed. Alyssa embarrasses her even more by stepping on her dress, causing the skirt to rip off, revealing her underwear in front of everybody, including people with cameras. Roger and Diane both find out in the end that it was Amanda and Alyssa that arranged all the meetings between the two of them the entire time.
