  Mari Illustrious Makinami, a new pilot, launched in Provisional Unit-05, destroys the resuscitated skeleton of the Third Angel in its attack on NERV's arctic Bethany Base and defeats the Angel by self-destructing Unit-05, safely ejecting at the last moment. Meanwhile, Shinji Ikari and his father Gendo visit Yui's grave, with the Seventh Angel attacking shortly before is dispatched by the newly arrived Unit-02 and its headstrong pilot, Asuka Langley Shikinami. Chief Inspector Ryoji Kaji, present at the battle with Unit-05 and arriving alongside Unit-02, delivers a suitcase to Gendo containing an object referred to as the "Key of Nebuchadnezzar" and notes that the destruction of Unit-05 went as planned. Later Shinji, Asuka, and Rei kill the Eighth Angel in a devised haphazard plan by Misato Katsuragi. Both Unit-00 and Unit-01 are damaged, but SEELE orders only the latter be repaired, as the former is no longer needed. Gendo and Kozo Fuyutsuki visit Tabgha Base on the Moon to view SEELE's progress on the mysterious "Evangelion Mark.06." Though they are denied landing, they confirm that its construction is different from the other EVAs and briefly see Kaworu Nagisa sitting on its finger. On Earth, Shinji decides to cook an extra lunch for Rei who asks Gendo for permission to host a dinner party but he initially refuses before remembering Yui's request to take care of Shinji. Rei invites everyone to her home for a cooked meal, with the intention of helping repair Gendo and Shinji's relationship. Mari arrives in Tokyo-3 by parachute, rather than in the covert manner she intended, landing on Shinji in the process. Soon, Evangelion Unit-04 and NERV's U.S. branch are destroyed during a test of an experimental engine, prompting the U.S. government to send the completed Unit-03 to Tokyo-3. In accordance with the "Vatican Treaty", where no nation is allowed to possess more than three functioning Evangelions at a time, NERV decides to seal Unit-02. Rei refuses to pilot the new Eva, which is to be tested on the same day as her planned dinner, with Asuka realizing how much Rei likes Shinji. Asuka volunteers to take her place before the Ninth Angel possesses the activation of Unit-03 and Shinji inside NERV's only functional EVA Unit-01 refuses to fight for fear of harming Asuka, who is still trapped inside. Gendo orders the activation of the dummy system causing the autonomous Unit-01 to savagely kill the Angel, crushing the entry plug in its teeth. Shinji is distraught over his father's actions and leaves NERV. Asuka survives, but is grievously injured and placed in quarantine for mental contamination fear by the Angel. As Shinji heads out of the city on a train, the Tenth Angel attacks. Gendo fails to activate Unit-01, as it rejects the dummy system. Mari hijacks Unit-02 and heads out to fight Zeruel, activating Unit-02s second best mode "The Beast", that removes the unit's restraints. In this mode, she successfully smashes through most of Zeruels multiple AT Fields, but is still taken out by the Angels rapid extending blade-like arms. Then, Rei's damaged Unit-00 emerges on the battlefield and charges at Zeruel with an NÂ² mine-armed missile. Rei attempts to neutralize Zeruel's AT Fields, but cannot on her own. The battered Unit-02 makes a last attack, tearing through the Angels remaining AT Fields with her teeth. Unit-00 throws Unit-02 out of the blast radius before the missile detonates. It fails to destroy Zeruel, and blows off Unit-00s arms in the process. Mari sees Shinji upon fleeing in the damaged Unit-02 and takes him to safety as the Angel consumes Unit-00, growing the body of a giant woman with its original one as the head. Once Shinji runs back and tells Gendo to let him pilot Unit-01, Zeruel easily breaks into the command center, bypassing NERV's auto-self destruct security measures by changing to Unit-00s blood pattern. Shinji fends it off and takes the fight back to the Geofront, but Unit-01 runs out of power and shuts down. The Angel throws Unit-01 into the side of a mountain, impaling it. Enraged and determined to save Rei no matter the cost, Shinji reactivates Unit-01 in berserker mode, glowing red with a halo over its head to take down the Angel to reveal its core, and reaches inside its core to try to save Rei. Shinji's willpower causes Unit-01 to start floating up into the air, taking the Angel up with it. The Halo above Unit-01's head expands to the size of a cyclone, making the sky glow red, and sweeping up debris all around them. Unit-01 presses its hands against the Angel's core, attempting to grant Shinji's wish, and starts transcending the boundaries of humanity. Inside the cockpit, Shinji sees Rei beyond him, floating huddled up and alone under a liquid-like surface. He climbs forward, reaching out for her through the surface taking hands and pulls out of the liquid and into his cockpit while Unit-01 pulls Unit-00's core out of the Angels core, moments before it collapses, as the Angel explodes into blood which combines with Unit-00's core, taking form of a giant Rei which is absorbed into Unit-01's core. Unit-01 sprouts giant wings of light, and Misato sees that they are identical to the ones she saw during Second Impact fifteen years ago. Ritsuko notes that the EVA is transcending humanity as a divine being, beginning Third Impact, and Apocalypse. In a post-credits scene, the Lance of Longinus in Earth neutralizes Unit-01, stopping Third Impact. Kaworu descends from the Moon in Mark.06, saying that he will make Shinji happy.
