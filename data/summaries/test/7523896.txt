In 1850 San Francisco, Russian Countess Marina Selanova  flees from an arranged marriage to Prince Semyon . She books passage with the "Portuguese"  to Sitka, where her uncle Governor Ivan Vorashilov  can protect her. When the Portuguese's bitter rival, Captain Jonathan Clark , frees his shanghaied crew, she sends a man to negotiate with him instead. However, Jonathan hates all Russians and turns down the offer. In desperation, Marina goes to the party he is throwing and, pretending to be the Countess's companion, gets him to change his mind. As he shows her the sights of the city in one whirlwind night, they fall in love. Jonathan proposes marriage and she gladly accepts. However, Prince Semyon finds Marina and takes her to Sitka. Believing Marina has tricked him, Jonathan races the Portuguese to Alaska, recklessly wagering his ship on who gets there first. Jonathan wins, but that doesn't stop the Portuguese from trying to steal his ship anyway. Unluckily, while both crews are brawling, a Russian gunboat appears and takes them all captive to Sitka. There, Prince Semyon forces Marina to agree to marry him in return for Jonathan's freedom. Jonathan and his men double back, rescue Marina, and sail away.
