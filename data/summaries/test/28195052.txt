 {{Plot}} Tinkers' Nook is bustling with activity, for the tinker fairies are making snowflake baskets for the fairies of winter. A flock of snowy owls soon arrive for the baskets, bringing a final shipment order for Fairy Mary  with them. Tinker Bell  watches as the birds headed off toward the Winter Woods in awe and curiosity. Later that day, Tinker Bell volunteers to help Fawn  take animals to the Winter Woods to hibernate, but Fawn warns Tinker Bell that they could only bring animals to the border, and they aren't allowed to go into the Winter Woods. With Fawn distracted by a sleeping marmot, Tinker Bell jumps across the border into the Winter Woods. Tink gazes in wonder at the beautiful wintry landscape, enchanted by the delicate snowflakes falling around her, and the strange colors her wings create. The moment ends when Fawn yanks Tinker Bell back into the Autumn Woods. Touching Tink's wings, Fawn gasps at their cold temperature and rushes her off to the fairy hospital. A healing-talent fairy  examines Tink's wings and warms them to normal temperature. Tink remains curious about the sparkles and colors her wings made in the Winter Woods. Tink flies off to the Book Nook, where she finds a wing-shaped book, but unfortunately, it's pages are all chewed through. A fairy ([[Thomas Lennon  tells Tink that the author of the book, the Keeper, might be able to help her, but he lives in the Winter Woods. Preparing herself for the Winter Woods, Tink sneaks into the tinkers' workshop and climbs inside one of the snowflake baskets, and flies her way into the Winter Woods. Suddenly, the owl accidentally drops the basket, and Tink crashes into the snow. Realizing her book had been flung from her bag after the landing, she tries to get it back before another fairy finds it. However, Lord Milori , the Lord of Winter, takes the book from Sled . Lord Milori asks Sled to return the book to the Keeper. Tinker Bell follows Sled to the Hall of Winter, upon arriving spotting the Keeper, Dewey . Then another winter fairy rushes into the room and proclaims that her wings are sparkling. Simultaneously, Tinker Bell's wings begin to sparkle, too. A force pulls her toward the winter fairy, who's name is Periwinkle . The girls ask Dewey to explain what was happening to their wings. Bringing Tink and Periwinkle to the giant snowflake, and positioning their wings, the whole chamber becomes filled with images of a baby's first laugh, that split in half: one to the Pixie Dust Tree, and the other to the Winter Woods. Tink and Periwinkle realize that they are fraternal twins. Suddenly, Lord Milori arrives, concerned over Tinker Bell's book, warning Dewey to send any 'warm' fairy back to the Autumn Woods. Dewey tells the girls they can have a little time to visit before Tink has to return home. The two go to Periwinkle's house, where she shows Tink her various items she had collected. Next, they go to the Frost Forest, to introduce Tink to Periwinkle's friends Gliss  and Spike . They continue to spend time together the entire day. That night outside Periwinkle's house, as Tinker Bell builds a fire to stay warm, she realizes that if she can make it warm in the Winter Woods, she can make it cooler at her home. Suddenly, the snow floor melts beneath them, weakened by the fire. After the incident, Dewey tells the girls that Tink has to go home. The girls realize that they might never see each other again, but Tinker Bell comes up with a plan. When the three fairies reach the border, Tinker Bell begins to fake crying while whispering to Periwinkle to meet her at the border tomorrow. When Tinker Bell arrives home, she asks her friends Clank  and Bobble  for help. Hard at work, some of Tink's other friends stop by and learn of Tinker Bell's sister, excited at the prospect of meeting her. The next day, Tinker Bell arrives at the border with Bobble and Clank, pulling along a snow-maker. Now able to keep Periwinkle cold enough, Peri's crosses the border to the 'warm' side of Pixie Hollow. She meets Tinker Bell's friends, Fawn, Iridessa , Rosetta , Silvermist , and Vidia  and continues her tour of the warm side of Pixie Hollow, until Tink noticed Periwinkle's wings wilting. The snow-maker was running out of ice, and there wasn't enough snow to keep Peri cold, so Tink and Periwinkle return to the border. Lord Milori appears and instructs Periwinkle how to fix her wings. Queen Clarion , arrives too, and explains to the girls that they can never see each other again. As the girls go their separate ways, the snow-maker gets knocked into the stream, and creates a snowstorm. Later that day, Queen Clarion tried to make Tinker Bell understand why the rule about not crossing the border was so important. She tells the story of two fairies who fell deeply in love, but were from the different worlds. One of the fairies crossed the border and broke a wing; an injury for which there was no cure. Just as the Queen finishes her sad tale, it begins to snow, causing a commotion. Queen Clarion, Tink, and a group of fairies arrive at the stream to find Clank and Bobble attempting to free the snow-maker. Finally, they succeeded in pushing the machine into the water, but it continues to snow. The seasons become thrown out of balance, and the life of the Pixie Dust Tree comes into question; if it becomes too cold, it will freeze and stop producing pixie dust. Tink then notices that a flower that Periwinkle had planted is still blooming, despite its warm surroundings. Tinker Bell flies straight to the Winter Woods, and asks Gliss and Periwinkle why the flower was still alive. Gliss explains that frost tucks warm air inside,and Periwinkle suggests that they could frost the Pixie Dust Tree before the cold comes. Tinker Bell and the frost fairies fly to the Pixie Dust Tree. They get right to work, but realize that the job would be too big for them to finish in time. Then Tinker Bell spotted Dewey, Lord Milori, and the rest of the frost fairies flying toward them, helping them frost the tree. Afraid the freeze had come too late, the fairies gather anxiously around the Pixie Dust Well, and rejoice when pixie dust then begins to flow again. Tinker Bell realizes that she had broken a wing when she had flown to the Winter Woods, and warns Periwinkle to go back to the Winter Woods before her wing wilt. As the sisters hold hands and say good-bye, an explosion of pure sparkly light bursts from their wings, healing Tink's broken wing. From that day on, warm fairies can cross over the border into the Winter Woods anytime they like. A coat of frost keeps the warm fairie's wings safe while in the cold. Strong and close friendships between warm fairies and winter fairies blossom, just as warm and beautiful as Periwinkle's flower.
