The film profiles Michael Perry, a man on death row convicted of murdering Sandra Stotler, a fifty-year-old nurse. He was suspected, but never charged, in two other murders which occurred in Conroe, Texas, with his accomplice Jason Burkett. Perry was convicted eight years earlier of the October 2001 murder, apparently committed in order to steal a car for a joyride. Perry denies that he was responsible for the killings, blaming Burkett  who was convicted of the other two murders. Burkett, who received a lesser life sentence for his involvement, likewise blames Perry.http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/tiff/2011/intotheabyss{{dead link|date"officialsite"/> The film also includes interviews with victims' families and law enforcement officers.{{cite news}} Burkett's wife appears in the film, a free woman who met and married Burkett after his conviction.
