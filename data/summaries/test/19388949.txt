Cheerful vagrant Stymie tries to get back in the good graces of the gang after stealing their pies. When a mean dogcatcher  tries to round up Pete the Pup, Stymie comes to the rescue, earning the undying devotion of the kids and the animosity of the dogcatcher, who vengefully bundles Petey off to the pound, intending to consign the poor pooch to the gas chamber. Desperately, Stymie prays for the five dollars necessary to spring Pete, whereupon a five-spot blows out of the hands of a lady shopper and lands at Stymie's feet. After out smarting a cop, with the help of Spanky, that was in pursuit to take it back he and the gang race to the dog pound. Upon arriving the dog catcher says that he already gassed Petey and was dead. Stymie and the gang sulk as another employee of the pound tells them Petey isn't dead. It turns out there wasn't any gas in the cylinders and Petey was just sitting alive in the chamber when opened. It ends with Petey chasing the dog catcher for revenge with the gang following.
