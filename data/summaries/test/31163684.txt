Army medical officer Tom Owen returns home to Coalville, Pennsylvania. He learns his brother Floyd, a mine safety engineer killed in an explosion, might have been negligent in his duty and is heavily in debt to a man named Dan Reasonover. Twice divorced Helen Curtis, who is Dan's daughter, asks Tom for a date. He is warned about her, but can't resist. Knowing that Tom has vowed to pay his late brother's debts, Helen persuades him to accept a position at a Pittsburgh clinic run by a Dr. Gleeson. New nurse Joan Lasher is disappointed that Tom treats wealthy society patients for minor ailments when he could be doing more good elsewhere. She is impressed by his idealistic Army acquaintance, Dr. Jim Crowley, who is concerned with the health of people more in need. Emergency surgery is needed for Helen's rich aunt. Her physician, Gleeson, pleads with Tom to perform the operation for him. Tom does, unethically, and Joan quits as his nurse. Helen's aunt offers a $10,000 reward, which Gleeson offers to split. In another mine explosion, Joan and Jim are trapped. Tom arrives in time to rescue them, but Jim dies in the ambulance. He resigns from the clinic and Helen leaves him, but Joan now stands by his side.
