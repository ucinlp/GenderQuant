Bangalore-based Police Inspector Amar, a reformed juvenile, convicted for knifing a male, is approached by Mumbai's Police Commissioner Vinod Talwar, and assigned the task of locating the killer of a businessman, Khanna. Amar soon finds out that the culprit is none other than his childhood friend, Raja Lokhande. His attempts to reform Raja will be ridiculed, his life will be endangered and out of control when he will be given an ultimatum to arrange an 'encounter' killing of not only Raja, but also his other childhood buddies, Surya, whose sister, Pooja, is his childhood sweetheart; and Jaggu, Raja's brother - while the underworld, led by Lala Roshanlal, asks him to prove himself by killing a Police Inspector attached to Naigaon Police Station.
