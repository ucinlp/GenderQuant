Murder Seen centers around Zoey Drayden , a botany grad student, who happens to experience disturbing visions. After receiving a phone call for help late at night and discovering some proof that her visions and the phone call have an actual basis, she goes to the police. They link her story to the case of an abducted student and first detain her as the only suspect. Detectives Keegan  and Stepnoski  eventually give some credit to her assertions. But when they find a new suspect and are obliged to release him for lack of proof, Zoey decides to track him herself.
