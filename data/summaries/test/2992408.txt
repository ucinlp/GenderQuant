The movie begins as the two-year term expires, and all the elders of the Wo Shing society are in the process of electing a new chairman, with some last-minute "campaigning" from both Lok  and Big D  a few days prior to the election. After bitter arguments from supporters of both candidates in the likes of Uncle Cocky  and Uncle Monk, Lok is elected as the new chairman. However, Big D is dismayed by the result and proceeds to punish two men responsible for his loss by kidnapping them and rolling them down a hill in boxes, prompting ex-chairman Whistle to ask his lieutenant Four-Eye to hide the dragon head baton, which is a symbol of power for the leader. In the meantime, Chief Superintendent Hui and the police, as well as the police in China arrests all the key figures that include Uncle Teng, Big D, Cocky, Monk and the newly-elected chairman Lok of the Wo Shing in an attempt to avoid infighting within the society. However, during a negotiation attempt in a holding cell, Big D's plans of organizing a new triad society are uncovered, which infuriates both Teng & Hui. Meanwhile, a pursuit of the baton ensues in which Kun , who is recovering the baton for Big D catches up with Big Head , who holds the baton and is recovering it for Lok. During the confrontation, Kun severely beats Big Head with a giant log in order for him to hand out the baton when Kun's boss informs him that the plan has changed and that Kun is to recover the baton for Lok. The leaders are eventually released on bail and after hours of never-ending pursuit between Kun, Jimmy, and Jet on route, Lok eventually receives the baton from Jimmy thus making his election official. Despite negotiations with Big D after his bail, Lok murders his nemesis with a boulder during a fishing trip with his son, Denny, Big D and D's wife after Big D insisted on proposing the idea of two chairmans and the sharing of power between them. As Lok is killing D, D's wife witnesses Lok and makes a run for it causing Lok to murder her too by strangling her against a tree with a log. D and his wife are then buried before Lok drives away with Denny, who becomes petrified after witnessing his dad's brutality as the movie comes to an end.
