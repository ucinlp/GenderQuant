Gwyneth McBride  is a Wiccan woman who attempts to open up a homeless shelter in a small community. She is threatened when a local crime lord Joe Merchant  with a mathematical bent—and a particular flair for chaos theory—sends in his thugs to intimidate her. She defends herself against anti-Pagan religious intolerance with both martial arts and the support of the homeless shelter residents.
