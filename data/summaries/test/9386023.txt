When newlyweds Jack  and Peggy  face eviction from their rented London flat, they are tricked into buying a rundown houseboat by its current owner Alfred Harper  and his put-upon wife . Mr Watson  owns Jack and Peggy’s mooring and soon makes their acquaintance by introducing them to his mooring tariffs and associated surcharges. After rebuilding the engine with the help of his friend Sid , a used-car salesman, Jack and Peggy plan a trip down the Thames River to Ramsgate, taking along Sid and his partner Sandra . On their way, they get into trouble with the Thames Conservancy  and also the river police . After Sandra's transistor radio gets misplaced next to the compass, they manage to end up in Calais. With no fuel and supplies, they have to resort to desperate actions to get themselves and their houseboat back home. This involves Sandra putting on a striptease for Watson, who also happens to be in Calais Harbour on his own boat, to enable Jack and Sid to borrow some of Watson’s fuel and food. The next morning they follow Watson back across the Channel, as their own compass is broken, and end up entering into a wager with Watson on who can get back to their mooring first.
