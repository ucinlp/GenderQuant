Seeking winter shelter, the Pink Panther enters Zammo the Great's house while the magician is away, and the panther discovers a mischievous rabbit that leads him through a series of phantasmagorical phenomena, including a mobile door with stairs that change from ascending to descending, depending on what position the door is at in relation to the floor, a tilted will picture that, when straightened, causes the whole house to tilt, a deceptive, two-way mirror, and a subjective, psychedelic hole in the floor. Eventually in the end, Zammo returns to his house to find his rabbit, who gets put back into Zammo's hat, before Zammo walks inside. The Pink Panther then walks off, only to be turned into a rabbit from behind his back.
