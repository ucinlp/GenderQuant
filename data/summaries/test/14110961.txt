Charlotte Castang is a working-class 13-year-old girl, who lives in a drab, run-down neighbourhood, and is ready to become an adult. She has been raised without a mother, and lives with her crass brother and her father, whose attention is elsewhere. Her only friend is Lulu, a sick 10-year-old pest she would like to be rid of. Charlotte is bored and dreams of a better life, and her life improves when she meets Clara Bauman, a pianist from the other side of the tracks, whom she admires. Charlotte wants to be friends with Clara, who she sees as her ticket out of the area, while the sophisticated Clara jokingly suggests that Charlotte should become her manager.
