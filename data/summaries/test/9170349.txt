In 1935, de la Torre initiated an investigation on the meat trade, which had been previously attempted without success by his fellow party member Julio Noble. In the midst of the investigation, de la Torre's disciple and friend, senator elect Enzo Bordabehere, was murdered, and the province of Santa Fe was intervened. The film chronicles de la Torre's and Bordavere's investigation, as well as the grooming of de la Torre's would-be assassin, Valdez Cora, by corrupt members of the senate, most notably the pro-Nazist Don Alberto.
