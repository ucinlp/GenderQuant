Former CIA agent and ex-Special Forces member Dean Cage is in a rehab program, haunted by a botched mission in Bosnia which resulted in the execution of his best friend Scott. While in a restaurant waiting for his girlfriend, Detective Amy Knight , he is mistakenly believed to be a CIA agent involved with a stolen military experimental truth serum. He is abducted by the real thieves and injected with the drug, which makes him relive the moments from the failed Bosnian mission and unable to discern who are his allies and who are his enemies. Amy has six hours to find the antidote and save Dean's life.
