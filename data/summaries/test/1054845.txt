 A mysterious meteorite is hurtling towards the earth. During its entry into the atmosphere, it almost wounds Rayquaza, a sky guardian living in the ozone layer. The meteorite crashes into a polar zone, revealing two egg-shaped objects. The purple egg regenerates into a Deoxys and picks up the green egg. Rayquaza descends from the ozone layer to fight the invader. A battle ensues, destroying a nearby research site and traumatizing a young boy, scared by a stampede of Spheal, Sealeo, and Walrein. The purple Deoxys traps Rayquaza and is about to beat it, but it is distracted by electricity from broken computers, giving Rayquaza a chance to obliterate the purple Deoxys with its Hyper Beam. Deoxys goes back to egg form and falls into the sea, while some researchers take the green egg with them. Beneath the sea, the injured Deoxys regenerates and waits. The green egg appears somewhere in Hoenn. Four years later, Ash, May, Brock, and Max travel to LaRousse City's Battle Tower. There they meet Tori , a boy who is afraid of Pokémon because of psychological trauma that had ensued from the stampede caused by the battle between Deoxys and Rayquaza. Tori is found to be a loner. Deoxys, which has fully healed, leaves to find the other green egg which Tori's parents are testing in a lab. In the Battle Tower, Ash mistakes Tori for a Pokémon trainer and they battle against Rafe and Sid, with Tori using Ash's Torkoal. However, Tory does not know how to handle Ash's Torkoal and they lose. Tori runs away, stopping to save a Minun which was trapped in a trash can. Later, Ash meets Tori's parents and they have fun until they see a mysterious purple aurora, signaling the return of Deoxys. When Deoxys begins to remove the city's inhabitants to search for the green egg, it is up to Ash, Pikachu, and Tori to help it find the egg. This is complicated by the return of Rayquaza, and the security robots malfunctioning. Deoxys and Rayquaza then continue to battle, causing havoc in the city. The green egg is regenerated when Pikachu and Minun and Plusle charge the power generator in the lab. As the fight continues, Deoxys tackles Rayquaza into the floor. He is about to release a final blow, but the green Deoxys arrives in perfect timing and quickly transforms into defense form saving Rayquaza from the attack. The city is filled with blocks of robots almost destroying Rayquaza, but with the help of the green and purple Deoxys, Rayquaza was saved.
