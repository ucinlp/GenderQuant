On the last day of school, the gang learns that their beloved teacher Miss Jones is going to be married and that, come September, they will have a new teacher named Mrs. Wilson, who will probably be an older widowed lady. Miss Jones's fianc√©e, Ralph, playfully paints a frightening picture of Mrs. Wilson as "a dried-up mean old woman," neglecting to inform the kids that his last name is Wilson and that Miss Jones will continue to be their teacher under her new, married name. Thanks to Ralph's ill-timed joshing, the youngsters convince themselves that the only way to retain their favorite teacher is to break up the wedding, starting with the prenuptial reception, where the kids surreptitiously spike the food with tabasco sauce, horseradish and garlic peppers. After they do this, they discover that Mrs. Wilson will actually be their current teacher, that she got special permission to keep her job, and that Mr. Wilson will allow her to teach them as long as she likes. Unfortunately, the gang wind up eating the ultra-spicy spaghetti.<ref namehttp://movies.nytimes.com/movie/225679/Teacher-s-Beau/overview |title2008-09-20|work=NY Times}}
