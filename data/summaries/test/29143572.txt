As the picture opens, a re-enacted phone call featuring reporter Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jr. in Germany, and narrator Edwin C. Hill in New York is depicted. Then a parade of people carrying torchlights in Berlin, where Jewish works and other political books are burned. Vanderbilt meets with Hill, and then flies out of the country. Hill talks with Vanderbilt about the problems in his country, then a re-enacted interview between Adolf Hitler and Vanderbilt. During a viewing of World War I battle footage, Hitler's home town, Leonidad, Austria, and his parents' graves are pictured. Vanderbilt goes to Vienna, to see Chancellor Dollfuss, and he films several Austrian Nazis riots during a parade. In a re-enactment, Vanderbilt's passport is stolen, and there are several shots of Nazis abusing Jews. In yet another re-enactment, Vanderbilt interviews Crown Prince Wilhelm, and more books are burned. Helen Keller talks to an interviewer about her books, which were burned by the Nazis. Then a conversation Vanderbilt, Kaiser Wilhelm II in Doorn, Holland, and Prince Louis Ferdinand had is re-enacted. Actual anti-Nazi speeches given by prominent Jews and some Gentiles are shown and the Nazis are shown trying to alter the Bible. In the final scene, Congressman Samuel Dickstein of New York and Hill give speeches directly to the audience, explaining the dangers of Nazism.
