The film takes place in 2000 in the fictional town of Spurbury, Vermont, near the Canadian border. The plot centers on five Vermont State Troopers who seem to have more of a knack for pranks than actual police work. The experienced Troopers, Thorn, Mac, and Foster, spend most of their time devising new ways of messing with the heads of the people they pull over and hazing the new recruit, "Rabbit". They also find time to torment their easily infuriated radio dispatcher, Rodney Farva, who has been removed from patrol work because he was involved in a fight with several students during a  traffic stop of a schoolbus . Their days of pranking and slacking off are cut short when the Troopers suddenly find their post and their jobs threatened by the state's impending budget cuts. The troopers have an ongoing rivalry with the local Spurbury Police Department. They repeatedly enter conflicts with them; one such dispute breaks out into an all-out fistfight, further increasing the station's chances of being shut down. Their chances to keep their station improve when they uncover a possible drug smuggling ring. When they suspect a connection to a murder investigation by the local police, State Trooper Captain O'Hagan ([[Brian Cox  tries to get Spurbury Police Chief Grady to cooperate, but Grady wants the trooper station shut down so his department can have a bigger budget. Foster secretly develops a relationship with Ursula, the Spurbury Police dispatcher, and together they find a stash of confiscated marijuana hidden in the Spurbury impound. Ursula suggests stealing the marijuana from the impound and showing it to the Governor  during a banquet so they can convince her to keep the trooper station open. However, Grady foils their plan by showing the marijuana to the Governor himself during the banquet, putting Foster and Ursula at odds with each other when Foster suspects that Ursula leaked the plan to Grady. The now-unemployed troopers learn that it was Farva, not Ursula, who informed Grady in exchange for a transfer to the local police. Farva's motivation arose from his constant belittlement by the other troopers, but he relents and wants to make amends. The troopers learn that the Spurbury Police runs protection for the drug smuggling ring. The former troopers and Ursula expose the corrupt policemen and smugglers and bring them to justice. Unfortunately their actions are not enough to earn reinstatement of their trooper unit because of the budget cuts. Three months later, Thorn and Rabbit are working as beer delivery men. They go to a house party run by a group of college kids whom they had previously arrested for marijuana possession. The underage college kids are at first panicked to see them, but begin vengefully tormenting them when they realize they are no longer state troopers. Thorn and Rabbit then take off their delivery clothes to reveal they are actually Spurbury Police officers, having replaced their corrupt predecessors, and are now free to continue their shenanigans, much to the college kids' discomfort.
