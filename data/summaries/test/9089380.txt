Like the play, the film tells the story of a gay couple – Renato Baldi , the manager of a Saint-Tropez nightclub featuring drag entertainment, and Albin Mougeotte , his star attraction – and the madness that ensues when Renato's son, Laurent , brings home his fiancée, Andrea , and her ultra-conservative parents  to meet them.
