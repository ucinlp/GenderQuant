Set in 1912 Mexico, an Arizona lawman named Lyedecker  travels to a remote village looking for Yaqui Joe , a half-Indian, half-white bank robber who has stolen $6,000  to buy rifles for his people who are being repressed by the government. Lyedecker isn't concerned with Yaqui Joe's cause of helping his tribe, and all he cares about is getting the money returned to a Phoenix bank within his jurisdiction.The two men escape to the hills where they are joined by Sarita , a beautiful Indian revolutionary. They eventually become allies and fight for the Indians. Taking over the leadership of the Yaquis, Lyedecker ambushes Verdugo's train while Sarita distracts the attention of the soldiers on board by taking a public shower.
