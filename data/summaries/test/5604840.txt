Laurel & Hardy try to sleep in a rent room. Hardy, suffering from a cold, coughs frequently, while Laurel snores. Both of them have trouble falling asleep because of this. They try to solve their problems, but this results in total chaos. The owner of the room (played by [[Charlie Hall  threatens to throw them out. When the duo is back in their room, their air mattress is filled up accidentally with gas and blown up so big that Stan and Ollie are pressed against the ceiling. After they have realized the trouble they are in, they start to panic, at which point the hotel owner and a police officer enter the room. Oliver sneezes and the mattress explodes.
