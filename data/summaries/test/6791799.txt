On May 20, 1941, thousands of elite German paratroopers assaulted the island of Crete. It was the beginning of the Battle of Crete - the largest German airborne operation of World War II. They had expected to control the island within a few days; after all, they only needed to occupy Paris for a week before France surrendered. What they hadnâ€™t expected was that the men, women, and even children of Crete would fight them to their dying breath. Together with hundreds of stranded soldiers from Britain, Australia, and New Zealand, and a handful of British special operations commandos and US special operation paramilitary officers from the OSS  who had parachuted in to help, the Cretan resistance dealt Nazi Germany one of its most crippling defeats of the entire war.
