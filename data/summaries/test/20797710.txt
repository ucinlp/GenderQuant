Jaivir Singh Rathod  is the chief executive and owner of Telpal Industries, a hugely successful auto firm. Yash is stepping down as CEO, in order to enjoy retirement. He gave the responsibility and authority to run the family business to his son, Rajiv . When Yash is walking his dogs and crossing at a busy intersection, a car drives through ... nearly running him over. He is irate and berates the woman driver. He calls for a policeman to do something about this menace. This is his first encounter with Sheetal, who was the woman driver. As Sheetal  drives off with Toshi , her sister-in-law, they are both laughing, releasing their tenson at this very close call with the law. She had pointed out to the policeman that it is against the law to walk two dogs at the same time. When they get home, Yash and Sheetal each describe the day's main event to their families. Little do they realize that their paths will cross again ... They share more in common than either of them realize. Each is totally devoted to their families, putting them first in their lives. Each of them made great sacrifices to keep the families together during tough times, by showing a strong and deep love, which seems occasionally to be taken for granted. Each lost a spouse whom they loved deeply. Sheetal is planning the marriage of her beautiful daughter Ria  to Sanju , the son of a wealthy upper-class family . Sanju's mother, Madhu  is not totally supportive of her son's choice for a wife. She feels he is marrying beneath his social class. She has objections to whatever date they choose for the ceremony. She is creating delays, hoping to break up their plans. Eventually Sanju is willing to defy his mother's authority and states he will elope with Ria unless his mother accepts her. Rajiv feels the pressure of trying to fill his father's shoes in running the family business. He is a well trained and highly educated executive who is insecure. When he is unsure of himself, he questions his father's love and support. It is by pure chance he discovers a family secret which proves once and forevermore his father's true feelings for his son. Sheetal and Yash meet again but it causes a great deal of misunderstandings. This one event creates havoc and confusion in the lives of both Yash and Sheetal and their children. Yash and Sheetal go out on a date and are seen dancing and dining at a Moroccan restaurant. A gossiping friend of Madhu reports this to her. Madhu uses it as yet another excuse to delay the date for the marriage of her son to Ria. Mr. Singh sees Sheetal leaving Sanju's home. She visited his parents to try to understand the reasons for Madhu's latest tactics. Mr.Singh refers to Sheetal as Mrs. Khurana and explains why. The children of both Sheetal and Yash are irate over their budding friendship. They even suspect it may be a secret love affair, carried on behind their backs. Toshi, Sheetal's sister-in-law has a brain storm of an idea to solve their deteriorating relationship with their children. Sheetal and Yash follow her advice
