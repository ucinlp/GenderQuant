In April 1942 the crew of a downed American B-25 Mitchell bomber are captured in a Wang Jingwei controlled section of China by a Chinese collaborator who transferred them to the Imperial Japanese Army. General Mitsubi refuses to allow the Swiss Consul to contact Washington. At the start of the trial, Lt. Greenbaum, an attorney in civilian life , explains that the trial is illegal, the men are in the military service of their country. The men suffer the interrogation and torture of the Japanese, the senior officer Captain Ross refuses to answer questions of the sly General Mitsubi. The general decides to break the men: Sgt. Jan Skvoznik,  is left in a catatonic state with a permanent head twitch. In court the men see the pitiful state of Skvoznik, Lts. Canelli and Vincent rush the Japanese general, quickly felled by rifle butts. They are returned to their cell, Canelli, an artist has a broken right hand and arm; Vincent, in a catatonic state much like Skvoznik. Sgt. Clinton returns seemingly unharmed, the Japanese have ruptured his vocal cords, he is unable to speak. The Japanese have a listening device in the cell when Greenbaum repeats what the speechless Clinton writes, if anything happens to Lt. Bayforth, he will tell all. After torture Bayforth returns with his hands and arms useless covered in black rubber gloves. The story relates the torture and hardship the men endured while in captivity, and their final humiliation: being tried, convicted and executed as war criminals. Throughout, the American stalwarts are subjected to mistreatment and systematic abuse by the sadistic General Mitsubi  who ultimately chooses to shoot himself, in the face of his captives' unshakable resolve and the realization that the Japanese are doomed to destruction.
