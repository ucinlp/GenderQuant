The film starts in medieval times, when a young couple is attacked by Templar knights. The man is instantly killed, the woman is carried away to the Templar's castle where she is sacrificed. The story then continues in the 20th century. A doctor and his wife are moving into a very primitive coast town, where they are met with distrust and hatred from the locals. It doesn't take long before the doctor and his wife find out that the town harbors an ancient evil: Every seven years undead Templars will ride from the sea for seven consecutive nights to demand the sacrifice of a young maiden. The doctor and his wife then try to save one of the maidens, Lucy, from her horrible fate, aided by the local village idiot.
