As a child summer means playing outside, lots of time to swim and ride your bike and run, run, run. These three activities make all the games of childhood possible. Leave it to adults to translate them into a serious athletic pursuit. Tied together, the swim, bike and run make up the sport of triathlon. In this film, three athletes take on the legendary California Triathlon, Wildflower. Set in the rugged terrain of central California the heat and hills test their preparation, endurance, and limits and we are along for the ride. Since December, we have followed three athletes, Rachel Sears, Brian Lavelle, and Sara Maas. Two are professionals, one is an amateur. But professional or amateur, no one is guaranteed success at this race, or even a finish.
