The Pink Panther wants to go on a ride with his self-built motorcycle, but it starts driving backwards at a frightening speed, and a policeman tries in vain to catch him for speeding. The panther builds another motorcycle, which splits in two in the midst of the ride, and the other half continues its way. When the panther rides his next vehicle, made out of bed frame bars, he gets caught by the policeman and sent to prison.
