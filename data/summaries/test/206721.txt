1928 Kansas: Wilma Dean "Deanie" Loomis  is a teenage girl who follows her mother's advice to resist her desire for sex with her boyfriend, Bud Stamper , the scion of one of the most prosperous families in town. In turn, Bud reluctantly follows the advice of his father, Ace , who suggests that he find another kind of girl with whom to satisfy his desires. Bud's parents are disappointed by, and ashamed of, his older sister, Ginny , a flapper and party girl who is sexually promiscuous, smokes, drinks, has had an abortion , and a marriage annulled, so they "pin all their hopes" on Bud, pressuring him to attend Yale University. Bud does find a girl who is willing to become sexually involved with him; when Deanie finds out and is later almost raped by another boy, she is driven close to madness and institutionalized. Her parents must sell their stock in order to pay for her institutionalization, which they do just before the Great Depression. Bud's family loses its fortune in the Crash of '29, which leads to the father's suicide. Ginny dies in an automobile accident, his mother lives nearby in squalor, and Bud takes up ranching, which he had postponed because of his father's aspirations for him. In the final scene, Deanie, home from the asylum after two years and six months, goes to meet Bud. He is now married to Angelina , the daughter of Italian immigrants; he and his wife, whom he met while complying with his father's desire that he attend Yale, have an infant child and are expecting another one. After their brief reunion, Deanie and Bud see that they must continue their lives separately; Deanie goes off to marry a doctor in Cincinnati whom she met at the asylum.
