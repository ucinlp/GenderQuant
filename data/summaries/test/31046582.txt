Eddie  is trained killer for the Eliminator Corp, a shadowy government organization dedicated to wasting society's undesirables. Since he is a devout Catholic, he reconciles his beliefs and career choice by taking a vow of celibacy. Sensing that her underling could use some fun, Eddie's boss -- known only as Middleman  -- sets him up on a blind date with no-nonsense Lois Newton . The tenacious Lois is struck by the gloomy loner and sets about trying to break Eddie's vow of chastity and his homicidal line of work. In the process, Eddie begins to rethink his life, much to the dismay of Middleman and his work associates. Jason Alexander, Michael Gilio, and Ed Asner co-star in this debut effort by writer-director Dwayne Johnson-Cochran. Love and Action in Chicago premiered at the 1999 Toronto Film Festival.
