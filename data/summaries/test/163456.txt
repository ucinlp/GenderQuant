Paul , a middle-aged American hotel owner mourning his wife's suicide, meets a young, engaged Parisian woman named Jeanne ([[Maria Schneider  in an apartment that both are interested in renting. Paul and Jeanne proceed to have an anonymous sexual relationship in the apartment, and Paul demands that neither of them share any personal information, not even their names. The affair goes on until one day Jeanne comes to the apartment to find that Paul has, without warning, packed up and left. Paul later meets Jeanne on the street and says that he wants to start anew with their relationship. He proceeds to tell her of the recent tragedy with his wife and the telling of his life story carries them to a tango bar where he continues telling her about himself. This loss of anonymity disillusions Jeanne about the relationship and she tells Paul she doesn't want to see him again. Paul, not wanting to let Jeanne go, chases her back to her apartment where he tells her that he loves her and finally wants to know her name. Unbeknown to Paul, Jeanne holds a gun that she has taken from a drawer. She tells him her name and shoots him. Paul, mortally wounded, staggers out onto the balcony, collapses, and dies. The audience then sees Jeanne dazed and muttering to herself that he was just a stranger who tried to rape her, reassuring herself that she did not know who he was in a rehearsal for questioning by the police.
