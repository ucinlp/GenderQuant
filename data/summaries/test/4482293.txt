Two people are attacked in a cemetery when slices of bread hurl themselves at them. They escape in their car as bread throws itself at them from offscreen. They make it to a farm house where they and others are besieged by rampant slices of killer bread. One gets smothered to death, leaving behind a white bread-strewn corpse. News reports speculate that an explosion at a bakery thus animating—as opposed to re-animating—all manner of bread. Even Communion Wafers attack people when priests using their Churches as Emergency shelters lead Mass. The group then barricades their sanctuary farmhouse, using toasters instead of torches to frighten off the bread and barricading the doors and wall with sandwich bags instead of boards. The two women go into the basement to keep safe, not knowing that there is a lunch bag next to them. The bread kills them and one of the men leaving only one person. At the end of the film, the sole survivor is smothered by the bread.
