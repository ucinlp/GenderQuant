On a riverboat, Mark Fallon impresses fellow gambler Kansas John Polly, who takes him under his wing. The advice includes being wary of the rich and dishonest F. Montague Caldwell, who is caught cheating by Mark in a poker game. Mark makes the acquaintance of attractive Angelique Dureau and her brother, Laurent, who gets in over his head at cards, losing not only all his money to Mark but a priceless necklace belonging to Angelique. She angrily declines when Mark offers to give it back. Caldwell and his men plot an ambush, but Kansas John is able to help Mark get away to New Orleans safely. There he meets the father of Angelique and Laurent, the sophisticated Edmond Dureau, who is impressed by Mark and wishes his daughter would feel differently toward him. Angelique instead weds a banker, George Elwood. Mark builds a successful casino. He and Edmond also give a helpful hand to Ann Conant, the daughter of an unlucky gambler who committed suicide. Laurent falls for Ann, but she is smitten with Mark. A duel is demanded, resulting in Laurent dishonorably firing prematurely. He misses, then has his life spared when Mark refuses to shoot back. Angelique's new banker husband skips town with everyone's money after a scandal is uncovered. Mark is once again penniless, so the only way he can think of to replenish his funds is to return to his old life as a gambler. Angelique realizes her true feelings and asks to go along.
