Chloe Lawrence  is a very driven teenager and leader of her high school's Model United Nations team. After performing particularly well in a competition, the team is selected to attend the international Model UN competition in London, United Kingdom. One of the team members, Randall, is unable to attend. Chloe's twin sister, Riley , steps in to fill the gap &ndash; to get closer to Chloe's attractive teammate, Brian, more than anything else. When the group arrives in London, they discover that someone is already representing their usual country: China. Undaunted, they improvise and end up representing the UK. Plenty of sight-seeing and shopping ensues, while Chloe takes a fancy to James Browning, the son of an English noble, Lord Browning, who is pressuring his son to achieve more. As the competition progresses, Chloe's over-competitive nature stalls her budding romance, Riley tries to get closer to Brian, and the team earns both admiration and anger for their unconventional methods. Nevertheless, tribulations are weathered and lessons learned about sportsmanship, overlooked friends, and learning to enjoy one's youth.
