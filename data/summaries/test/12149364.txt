Young Pete Lender is setting up traps around his house, explaining to his parents that things in their house are being stolen, despite his parents believing otherwise. The humans leave and a family of tiny people , Pod Clock, Arrietty Clock and Peagreen Clock make their way through the kitchen to "borrow" the radio's battery. Arrietty, while treating herself with some ice cream in the freezer, is accidentally shut inside just as the Lenders return. Pod manages to rescue Arietty, but jams the ice cube tube in the process and is forced to leave one of his gadgets behind, which is found by Mr Lender. Meanwhile, the will of Mrs. Lender's aunt, Mrs. Allabaster, is the only proof that the house rightfully belongs to the family, yet their lawyer, Ocious P. Potter cannot find it, and has already made plans to demolish their house in order to build condominiums on the land. The Lenders have until Saturday to move away. Arietty wanders off and is trapped by Pete, who is actually astonished to discover the Borrowers and offers his help in moving them to their new house. Pod reluctantly agrees, but during the journey, Arrietty and Peagreen fall out of the moving truck and make their way back to the old house, where they find the new house on a map. However, Potter turns up and finds the will hidden in a safe inside the wall , but as he tries to burn it, Arrietty and Peagreen steal the will, determined to save the house. Potter, seeing the Clocks' underground home, calls the local exterminator, Jeff, but they manage to escape, with Jeff accidentally burning Potter's face and mustache off, with expanding foam, in the process. Potter and Jeff give chase by having Jeff's bloodhound, Mr Smelly, sniff Peagreen's jacket and follow the scent to a milk factory. Along the way, they occasionally bump into a local policeman, Officer Steady, who questions their actions. Around the same time, Jeff starts to question Potter's intention of killing the Borrowers, after seeing how truly capable that they are, resulting Potter to break off with him. Peagreen becomes trapped in an empty milk bottle and taken into the factory with Arrietty unable to save him, but another Borrower, Spud Spiller, an "Outie" , shows up and offers help. Together they manage to make their way through the factory and locate Peagreen and force their way past Potter, dousing him in a shower of liquid cheese in the process. Meanwhile, Pod and his wife, Homily, discover that their children are missing and, with Pete's help, track them to the milk factory. Pod rescues Peagreen from drowning in a milk bottle just as Arrietty and Spiller reunite with them. Unfortunately, Potter catches them, steals the will and ties them to the cheese machine, intending to drown them in the liquid cheese. Spiller cheeks Potter to the point that Potter dumps him in another machine, apparently killing him. Just before the cheese can hit, Pete arrives and turns the machine off. He and the Borrowers, this time with Jeff's help, follow Potter to City Hall to stop him arranging the demolition. He is briefly stalled thanks to the receptionist who gives him confusing directions to the demolition office in response to his rude behavior. When he finally reaches the door, he finds himself trapped inside the storeroom instead, where the Clocks tie his hands to his face with Sellotape. In his rage, Potter breaks off and attempts to vacuum the Clocks when an army of Borrowers turns up to save them. The Borrowers tie Potter up with wire and it is revealed that Spiller had survived the machine at the factory and summoned the army to aid the Clocks. Pod delivers a speech to Potter on the Borrowers' behalf, and they disappear as soon as they hear the door open. Pete, Jeff, and Officer Steady enter, and Pete recovers the will from Potter and shows it to Steady, proving Potter's deceit and his plan to cheat the Lenders out of their house. Potter rambles about the Borrowers, resulting an unconvinced Steady to arrest him for fraud and theft. Having obtained the will, the Lenders move back into their house, and Pete becomes friends with the Clocks and regularly gives them food while keeping their existence a secret. A post-credits scene shows Potter trying to describe the Borrowers to Steady at interrogation only to be mocked and laughed at by the police. As a result, Potter is indicted, and the film closes with his mugshot being taken.
