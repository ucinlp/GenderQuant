As the government begins experimenting with a bacteriological weapon in a small town in Eastern Europe, a disaster occurs in which the weapon spreads its effects on the citizens of the area, turning them into mutated zombies. To cover up the exposure and make it look like a nuclear meltdown, a team of contracted mercenaries are sent in to wipe out the zombie plague and secure the "accident" while facing off with the infected horde.http://www.searchmytrash.com/articles/carlwharton%287-12%29.shtmlhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2081438/plotsummary
