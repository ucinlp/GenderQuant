Set against the backdrop of the new culture of bandhs  that frequently immobilize post-conflict Nepal, Highway explores five different relationship stories that become intertwined during an ill-fated bus journey from eastern Nepal to the capital, Kathmandu. While the passengers - each of whom urgently needs to be somewhere else - await a resolution to the combustible strike that is blocking the only passable road, the film explores the psychological and spiritual bandhs that many Nepalese contend with.http://www.louverturefilms.com/ss/projects http://indiejournalism.org/highwaymoviereview/
