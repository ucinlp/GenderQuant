Eric Binford is a hollow, chain smoking young man who is also an obsessed film addict whose love of old films extends far beyond his job at a Los Angeles film distributor's warehouse and endless late night film screenings in his bedroom. For his vast knowledge, he's been bullied by his friends and family. His singular obsession eventually rounds the bend into psychosis after he crosses paths with Marilyn O'Connor , an Australian model and a Marilyn Monroe look-alike who becomes the physical embodiment of his cinematic desires. When  stood up by Marilyn on what would have been their first date, Eric becomes homicidally unbalanced, transforming himself into a gallery of classic film characters - including Dracula, The Mummy, Hopalong Cassidy, and Norman Bates - and sets out to destroy his oppressors, starting with his crotchety wheelchair-using, ex-dancer Aunt Stella whom he pushes her wheelchair down a staircase to her death, reenacting a scene from the 1947 film Kiss of Death and makes it look like an accident. Eric attends her funeral dressed as Tommy Udo - Richard Widmark's role from the aforementioned film. Eric then dresses up as Count Dracula to attend a midnight screening of Night of the Living Dead at a local cinema, and afterwords targets a hooker who had earlier snubbed him. She trips, falling to her death, and Eric drinks her blood. A few more nights later, Eric dresses up as the cowboy Hopalong Cassidy where he shoots and kills a boorish co-worker , who taunted him on a regular basis. Another few nights later, Eric dresses up as the Mummy where he drives his mean and vindictive boss, Mr. Berger , into suffering a fatal heart attack while he is working late night at the distribution warehouse. Finally, Eric dresses up as gangster Cody Jarrett (from [[White Heat  and kills a sleazy filmmaker, named Gary Bially, who stole his idea as his own for an upcoming feature film at a barber shop in broad daylight which finally gives away his identity. Eric then eventually works his way toward Marilyn hoping to lure her to his side. Investigating the murders is a criminal psychologist, named Dr. Jerry Moriarty , who tries to find a pattern to the murders and find Eric, to help or stop him, with the assistance of a friendly policewoman. But Moriarty's investigation is hampered by his own mean-spirited and nasty boss Captain Gallagher, who tries to stop Moriarty's investigation because Gallagher wants to take all the credit of finding the killer for himself. It all leads to Eric luring Marilyn to a photography studio where he drugs her to reenact a scene from The Prince and the Showgirl which is interrupted when Dr. Moriarty arrives and Eric is forced to run with Marilyn at his side. It leads to the Grauman's Chinese Theatre where the insane Eric is shot dead by the police on the roof of the building while reenacting Cody Jarrett's death scene in White Heat.
