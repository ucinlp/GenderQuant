At a Texas high school, Mandy Lane  is a popular outsider. Dylan  invites her to a party at his house and she accepts with the provision that her best friend, Emmet ([[Michael Welch , can attend also. At the party, Dylan and Emmet clash, and Emmet sits on the roof overlooking the pool watching Mandy. Dylan joins him and is convinced to jump from the roof to the pool to get Mandy's attention. Dylan jumps but misses, hitting his head on the edge of the pool and dies. Nine months later, Red  is having a party at his father's ranch and has invited Mandy along. She obtains permission from her Aunt  and agrees to go. Since Dylan's death she has refused to talk to Emmet. On the way to the ranch, the kids take a break at a railroad track, then steal a keg from a driver  at a truck stop. When they arrive at the ranch Chloe  won't drive her car over the cattle grid and so with a shortage of seats Mandy and Bird  elect to walk to the ranch. While walking, Bird asks to hold Mandy's hand, and she agrees. He then asks if he can kiss her, to which she agrees also, and he kisses her on the cheek, but is interrupted by Garth , the ranch hand. Once at the house, they begin drinking and playing games. Mandy is the only one to stay sober. After a disparaging remark, Jake  walks out, followed by his girlfriend, Marlin . They stop in a cattle shed, engage in oral sex, then Jake leaves. Marlin is hit in the jaw with the butt of a shotgun. The double-barrel is rammed down her throat, almost killing her. While looking for Marlin, Jake discovers her, barely alive, but is shot by the stranger, and Marlin finally dies. Meanwhile, Bird, Mandy, Red, and Chloe are joined by Garth at the house after a stranger in Red's car fires fireworks at them on the porch. Bird chases the car, believing that Jake is the driver, but he encounters Emmet. During their fight, Emmet blinds Bird by cutting his eyes, chases him and finally stabs him to death. At the ranch, Garth stays over. Mandy falls asleep in the kitchen. Red and Chloe fall asleep on the couch. In the morning, Emmet is in the house , and Garth runs upstairs. Emmet goes downstairs and walks over to Mandy, stroking her hair. Garth runs back down to find Mandy still asleep with blood on her hair from Emmet, who also left a message on the fridge reading "Wake Up" with a bloody handprint. Garth and Mandy realize that they need to leave and go to wake up Red and Chloe. As they prepare to leave, Emmet shoots Garth. Red and Chloe escape out the back and run to Chloe's car. There they discover the bodies of Jake and Marlin, after a brief kiss Red is shot in the leg. After running away, Chloe then discovers the body of Bird, as she runs back to the ranch. She is chased by Emmet driving her car. Mandy retrieves the keys to Garth's jeep, and the hunting knife Emmet used to kill Bird. She then sees Chloe running towards the ranch, pursued by Emmet. As Chloe runs up to Mandy, she stabs Chloe in the stomach. While Chloe bleeds out, Emmet and Mandy discuss their plan. Emmet has kept a journal giving the reason behind the killings since he and Mandy have previously agreed to a suicide pact. However, Mandy changes her mind and refuses to take the pills Emmet gives her. They have an argument, which ends up in a fight. Garth shoots Emmet as Emmet chases Mandy; she fights him off, long enough to obtain a sharp object and kill him. Mandy then picks up a wounded Garth and heads to his truck. They drive off, with Garth calling Mandy a "hero". A flashback then shows the group back at a railroad track, taking a break from the drive. They are all goofing off, and Mandy is seen balancing on the tracks, giving the camera a knowing look.
