In space, Ultraman Cosmos is at the battle with Baltan to stop him to invade Earth. A young boy named Musashi  who is a 5th grader who has a lot of dreams, such as becoming astronaut to sail the sea of stars, and meet Ultraman. One night he comes to the forest park to observe eclipse with his friends. Unfortunately it rains, so everybody goes home except Musashi. Meanwhile, in the rain, Ultraman Cosmos is at the battle with Baltan to stop him to invade the cities. They both use their powers to clash each other. After the explosion, they fall in different directions. Later Musashi went to see what happen in the forest. Ultraman Cosmos comes in front of Musashi, lost lots of energy during the battle. Ultraman Cosmos regained the power with the help of Musashi. Before Cosmos leaves Earth, he gives a mysterious blue bright stone to Musashi. Later on Earth, Baltan awakens monster from hibernation, which is put into sleep again by the SEAS. However, the military robbed Musashi of the blue stone, which is later retrieved by Mari  under the help of a mini-Baltan. Later, Baltan made an official broadcast through the help of the interpretation of SEAS, stating he would like to co-habitat on this planets with the lives on Earth and will have a negotiation with the human beings. Despite the effort of the SEAS to smooth out the neogtiation, the military had abruptly turned the things to worse when they attacked the alien. Forcing the alien into an unstoppable rage and the now raged Baltan stated that he would conquer the Earth in return to the hostile action. In order to save both sides from an unimaginable disaster, Ultraman Cosmos is again summoned by the determined Musashi to stop Baltan's rampage. Although it's successful at first to stop Baltan, the alien changed into his stronger fighting form to overrun Cosmos. In return, Cosmos changed into Corona form to counter it. Eventually, baltan is subdued with a Blazing Wave attack by Cosmos. Knowing what he has done wrong that ruined the chance of his offspring to have a new planet to live on, baltan killed himself with an internal explosion. At this time, Cosmos changed back to Luna form to return Baltan from his battle form and transport the dead body of the alien back to the hands of his offspring. In such peaceful moment however, the military planned a missile attack on Cosmos, which fortunately is thwarted by the combined effort of Musashi and his father. After the incident and before Cosmos's leave, the Ultraman told Musashi that they will meet again sometime.
