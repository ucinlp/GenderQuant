As a clairvoyant, Marina awaits signs from beyond that her true love, whoever he may be, is waiting for her, somewhere. When New York butcher Leo Lemke shows up on the tiny North Carolina island of Okracoke, where Marina lives, she is convinced that he is the man predestined to be her husband. After the wedding, Marina moves into Leo's blue-collar neighborhood, where she successfully commiserates with such eccentrics as withdrawn teenager Eugene, frustrated singer Stella Keefover, unlucky-in-love actress Robyn Graves, over analytical psychiatrist Dr. Alex Tremor, and frustrated dress shop clerk Grace. As Marina helpfully tries to chart the destinies of her new friends, she fails to notice that Leo is falling in love with Stella. Though there are many traumatic detours along the way, Marina's psychic talents have very positive effects on at least one of the characters, Doc Tremor, who is falling in love with her. During their meetings, Doc Tremor begins to speak of Plato's theory of love and the notion of man and woman as "split-apart" halves of one whole being. He says of the notion, "It's a corruption [of Plato's actual theory], but it's Plato nonetheless."
