Sir Alfred de Carter  is a world-famous symphony conductor who returns from a visit to his native England and discovers that his rich and boring brother-in-law, August Henshler , has misunderstood Alfred's casual instruction to watch over his much younger wife Daphne  while he was away, and instead hired a detective named Sweeney  to follow her. Alfred is livid, and ineptly attempts to destroy any evidence of the detective's report. Eventually, despite his efforts, he learns the content of the report directly from Sweeney: while he was gone, his wife was spied late at night going to the hotel room of Alfred's secretary, Anthony Windborn , a man closer in age to her own, where she stayed for thirty-eight minutes. Distressed by the news, Alfred quarrels with Daphne before proceeding to his concert, where he conducts three distinct pieces of romantic-era music, envisioning revenge scenarios appropriate to each one: a complicated "perfect crime" scenario in which he murders his wife and frames Windborn , nobly accepting the situation and giving Daphne a generous check and his blessing (to the Prelude to Wagner's [[Tannh√§user , and a game of Russian roulette with a blubbering Windborn, that ends in de Carter's Suicide (to Tchaikovsky's [[Francesca da Rimini  After the concert, Alfred tries to stage his fantasy of murdering his wife, but is thwarted by his own ineptness, making a mess of their apartment in the process. When Daphne returns home, he realizes that she really loves him, and learns that she is innocent of Sweeney's charges: she had gone to Windborn's room in search of her sister Barbara , August's wife, who was having an affair with Windborn, and became trapped there when she saw Sweeney spying on the room. Alfred begs Daphne's forgiveness for his irrational behavior, which she gladly gives, ascribing it to the creative temperament of a great artist.TCM Full synopsis<ref nameavg&sql=1:51839~T0 Plot synopsis ]
