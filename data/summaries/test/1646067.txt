David Freeman  is an average 12-year-old American boy living in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in 1978. On the night of July 4, his mother Helen , asks him to get his younger brother, Jeff , from a friend's house on the other side of the woods. While walking through the woods, he falls down into a ravine and is knocked unconscious. He wakes up after what seems like a few moments and walks home. He is shocked to find that his family no longer lives there; somehow he's traveled into the future, 1986. The police take him to a house where he is reunited with his family, now eight years older. Meanwhile, an extraterrestrial spacecraft has crashed into some high-tension power lines. NASA agents convince the police that it is theirs and take it to their base. They intend to study it, but find the craft seamless and impenetrable. In the meantime, David is taken to the hospital to discover why he hasn't aged. The doctors begin performing tests on his brain and find it contains accurate starcharts. The lead NASA scientist, Dr. Faraday , hears about David and requests that he be taken to the same facility where the UFO is kept. Further scans reveal that his brain contains alien data and unknown star charts from a planet called Phaelon, 560 light-years from Earth. The concept of time dilation due to faster-than-lightspeed travel is used to explain how he may have been in space for only 4 1/2 hours, while eight years passed on Earth. David befriends an intern named Carolyn McAdams  and tells her to let his parents know that the institute plans to keep him locked up. The next morning, he hears a voice telepathically. He escapes from his room by hiding in a service robot and is taken to where the ship is stored. Once inside, he meets its pilot, an artificial intelligence called a Trimaxian Drone Ship from the planet Phaelon, who David nicknames Max . Referring to him as "Navigator", Max accepts his command to escape the base. The ship takes off from the NASA facility and travels straight up to a low earth orbit as David struggles to issue precise orders to Max. After working through their initial confusion they hide on the ocean floor. Max tells David that his mission was to travel the galaxy, collect biological specimens, and take them back to Phaelon for analysis before returning them to their homes. He discovered humans only use 10% of their brain and as an experiment, David's brain was filled with miscellaneous information, including star charts. Max then returned him to Earth, but didn't take him back to his own time, fearing that humans were too delicate for time travel. Before returning to Phaelon, Max stopped to examine a patch of wild flowers and accidentally crashed the ship into the nearby power lines, erasing all the computer's star charts and data. He therefore needs the information in David's brain to return home. While Max prepares to perform a brain scan on David, he shows the boy the remaining alien specimens he has to return to their homeworlds. David bonds with a Puckmaren, a tiny alien species and the last of his kind, since his world was destroyed. After a while, Max performs the scan, but in the process also contracts the ability for emotions and attitude, making him more human in behavior, but also funnier, stubborn and argumentative. David and Max start bickering, so Max's response is to shut down and allow the ship to fall from orbit, taunting David to become the navigator. He manages to activate the manual controls and takes over. They travel around the planet trying to decide what to do next, all the while being tracked by NASA. In the meantime, Carolyn has made contact with David's family and told them about his escape in the ship; as a result, Dr. Faraday has them put under house arrest. To find his way home to his family, David stops to use a gas station pay phone, calls home and has Jeff send a signal so he can find the new house. Jeff lights a series of fireworks, which David is able to home in on. He is initially thrilled that he will soon return home, but becomes despondent upon realizing that he has lost eight years with his family. Upon arriving and seeing government agents waiting for him, David decides that he does not belong in 1986, says goodbye, and orders Max to take him back to his own time, regardless of the risks. Max reluctantly travels back with David and successfully returns him unharmed and at the same moment he left. David makes his way home and finds everything the way he left it. His family take off in their boat to see the fireworks and he makes up with Jeff. He discovers that he has a stowaway in his backpack, the Puckmaren. Jeff sees the tiny new pet, too, and agrees to keep it a secret. The film ends with Max flying off amidst the Fourth of July fireworks, shouting "See ya later, Navigator."
