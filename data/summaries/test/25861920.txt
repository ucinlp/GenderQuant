Susan Clarkson  agrees to go with Jason  and three other young crew members who have built themselves a 60 foot yacht, and take the yacht out to sea from San Diego to Vancouver to deliver it to a potential buyer. However the over-anxious captain sails off course and the kids run into some bad weather. While out at sea, the yacht sinks leaving the teens to fend for themselves against the merciless elements. All trapped on an emergency raft, they find themselves without food, water or supplies and with sharks posing a constant threat to their survival.
