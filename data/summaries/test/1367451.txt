John, the heir to the Earl of Greystoke , and his wife Alice  set sail and are quickly marooned in Africa. After John builds a home in the trees, Alice gives birth to a son. Soon after, Alice grows delirious and dies. When John finds her recently dead, the tree house is visited by curious chimpanzees, and John is killed by one of the apes. The female of the group, Kala, carries her dead infant, but upon hearing the cries of the infant human in his crib, she adopts the boy and raises him among the family of Mangani. The little human child thus grows up naked, wild, and free. At age 5, the boy  is still trying to fit in with his ape family. When a black panther attacks, he learns how to swim in order to evade it while another chimp is killed. At age 12, the boy  discovers the tree-house in which he lived as a baby with his mother and father and finds a wooden block, with pictures of both a boy and a chimpanzee painted on it. It is there, after seeing himself in a mirror, that the physical difference between him and the rest of his ape family is made more apparent. He later discovers his father's hunting knife and how it works. The objects fascinate the naked ape boy, who carries them with him. Years pass, and the young man  becomes the dominant male of the ape group. He protects and shows love toward his adopted mother, father and siblings. He loses his mother  to a hunting party of natives and kills one of them. He is intensely aggrieved by his mother's death and cannot reconcile this event, wailing and howling forlornly at the sky. Years later, Philippe D'Arnot  leads a band of British adventurers along the river, though he is disgusted by their boorish nature and love of 'blood and sport'. A band of natives attack the party, killing everyone except Philippe, who is injured and conceals himself in the trees. The now half-naked man  finds Philippe and nurses him back to health. D'Arnot discovers that the man is a natural mimic and teaches him to speak rudimentary English. D'Arnot deduces that this man is the son of the late Lord John and Lady Alice of Greystoke and calls the man "Jean" . Jean agrees to return to England with his benefactor and reunite with his family. On arrival at Greystoke, the family estate, John is welcomed by his grandfather, the Earl of Greystoke , and his ward, a young American woman called Jane . The Earl is now elderly and has obviously suffered from the loss of his son and daughter-in-law years earlier, displaying eccentric behavior and sometimes forgetting that John is his grandson, not his son returned. John is seen as a novelty by the local social set, and some of his behavior is seen as threatening and savage. He befriends a young mentally disabled worker on the estate and in his company relaxes into his natural behavior. Jane teaches John more English, French and social skills  and the two become very close, making love one evening in secret. Lord Greystoke seems to enjoy renewed vigor at the return of his grandson and, reminiscing about his childhood game of using a silver tray as a toboggan on a large flight of stairs in the grand house, decides to relive the old pastime. He crashes at the foot of the stairs and slowly dies, apparently from a head injury, in the arms of his grandson. At his passing, John displays similar emotion and lack of understanding about death as he did in Africa following the death of his adoptive mother. Jane helps John through his grief, and the two become engaged. As the official Earl of Greystoke, John visits the Natural History Museum in London with Jane. During their visit, John is disturbed by the crude displays of stuffed animals. He discovers many caged apes from Africa, including his adoptive ape father . The two recognize one another and John breaks open the cage and escapes with Kerchak, releasing other caged animals, pursued by police and museum officials. They make it to a woodland park, but when Kerchak climbs a tree to avoid capture, he is fatally shot and John is devastated to lose yet another loved one, yelling to the crowd, "He was my father"! That night, John rides his carriage in circles in front of his estate, howling to the sky and wailing "Father". Feeling that he cannot assimilate to the cruel nature of human society, John decides to return to Africa and reunite with his chimp family. Philippe and Jane escort him back to Africa and to the jungle where Philippe and John first met. There, John strips back into his loincloth and returns to the world and life he understands.
