In the year 2025, earth sends an expedition to Mars in the spaceship Izanami. A huge rock formation is discovered beneath the surface, and is transported back to earth. On the way back, the rock's temperature soars, causing the Izanami to explode and crash-land in Tokyo, leaving a large crater. The rock hatches into a colossal alien life form, which proceeds to attack Japan with bolts of energy from its many appendages and orifices. Missiles, tanks, and aircraft all attack but fail to destroy Negadon , whose thick exoskeleton protects it from conventional weaponry. At the same time, Ry√ªichi Narasaki, a downcast robotics constructor, is still devastated by the incident that cost him his left eye and the life of his only child, a young daughter. The incident was caused by the malfunctioning of his masterpiece, the giant super-robot MI-6 2 Miroku. Because of the ominous threat of Negadon, Narasaki faces the painful choice of reactivating  Miroku to destroy Negadon and save the world. After an epic battle, Narasaki  hauls Negadon into the upper atmosphere and destroys the space creature. His mission accomplished, Narasaki allows himself and Miroku to die when Negadon explodes.
