In early 1960s Oklahoma, a time of economic distress and small town politics, high school sports are an integral part of the town's fabric and pride, but girls' sports are an afterthought and warrant little or no attention. Clay Driscoll, a young coach with big dreams, is hired by the local superintendent to coach boys' basketball. Clay immediately finds himself head-to-head with Ellis Brawley, the town's ultimate boss, great-great grandson of the town's founder, owner of the bank and head of the school board. Clay is crushed by the news from Brawley that the job of boys’ coach has gone to “someone more qualified” and that he will be coaching the girls’ team. With his dream dashed and his future uncertain, Clay begins a journey from despair to acceptance, challenge, and finally destiny. Supported and inspired at every hurdle by his wife Jean's wisdom and strength, Clay decides to stay and take on the seemingly impossible task of coaching the hapless Lady Cyclones. Lacking confidence, the rag-tag girls are ridiculed by the boys for wearing their oversized hand-me-downs, for even trying to play ball. But Clay learns as much from "his girls" as he teaches them. The Lady Cyclones are challenged at every step by a dismissive school board and the ever-present 1960s small-town attitude that girls just shouldn’t be playing competitive sports. Through it all, Clay and Jean fight the system, support the girls, work to heal a wound in their own marriage, and turn around what was a neglected stepchild program with a long history of losing. The community eventually rallies behind Clay and the girls as they strive to achieve the unbelievable — the State Championship.
