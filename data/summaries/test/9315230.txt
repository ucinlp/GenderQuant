The film is seen through the eyes of a ten-year-old boy, Harry , who does not know that Argentina's 1976 coup d'Ã©tat is impacting his life. After witnessing the "disappearance" of dissident friends, a human rights lawyer  and his research scientist wife  flee the city and hide from the military police in a vacant summer house. With them are their two kids: Harry, who is fascinated with the escape artistry of Harry Houdini, and El Enano, his little brother.  The family adopts new identities and attempts to lead a normal life. Later, they are joined by a student who is using the alias Lucas . Their new life is difficult, but a visit with their estranged grandparents  reveals that they are still a close-knit family. Subtly hinted, however, and used as a metaphor, is the mother's constant smoking and El Enano's renewed bed-wetting. Both serve to show how stressful and precarious their situation is.
