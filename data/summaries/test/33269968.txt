Thambi Vettothi Sundaram is set in Kaliyakkavila, a town set on the state border. This place has a unique distinction; almost everyone here is educated and quite peculiarly, almost every second person is involved in some kind of illegal business ranging from smuggling to the brewing of illegal liquor and other such activities. This place is certainly an antithesis for all those who believe that education is the one solution to all social evils. Here, people seem to be corrupt in spite of education. Sundaram  is one from the town, well educated, but not yet initiated into any subversive acts. He has no idea to drift off onto the wrong side of the law, but the place and people are such that he finds it near impossible to follow a straightforward means of livelihood. He is confused, vexed, angry and then finds someone  who seems to understand his troubles; they form a jolly good duo. So, who is Saravanan, what does the duo end up doing, do they cleanse society, do they join the fray, do they make enemies? And, in the midst of this, there is a love story as an admiring Anjali falls for Karan; not without good reason! finally in a fight with the don of smuggling, the don burn sundaram's eyes with a mix of acid+chalk powder and also breaks a part of his spinal cord. Eventhogh sundram kills all, he loses eyesight and cannot stand erect for more than 15 minutes. So he kill himself by lying under a moving bullock cart. 2 years later , anjali gets Sundaram's appointment letter as a teacher and she cries!
