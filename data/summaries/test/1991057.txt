Kai and Stefan are two friends who own a gourmet pizza delivery business as a front for selling cannabis. Stefan is finishing law school and preparing to take the Bar examination to become a lawyer under the behest of his father who is a judge. They visit their outdoor cannabis grow operation and discover that aphids are destroying their plants. They visit a head shop and meet Achim who informs them that he knows how to get rid of aphids and hands them a tub full of Aphidoletes aphidimyza. Unbeknownst to the protagonists, Achim is an undercover police officer. After much debate, the duo bring Achim to the plantation so that Achim can help with the aphid problem and use an adulterant on the plants called "Brain cell massacre" which according to Achim is used in Kazakhstan plantations. On the way to the grow area, they try to pick psychedelic mushrooms convinced that nobody will be suspicious of mushrooms on a pizza. They test them out on Achim while he is at the plantation stating that they already tried some. Achim is poisoned by the mushrooms and goes into a convulsive state when a hunter is spotted nearby. The "Brain cell massacre" is used to knock Achim out and he is locked in the protagonists' trunk along with the harvested crop itself and the hunter who discovered the cannabis plantation. After narrowly avoiding a police search, the duo confront Stefan's father and confess their situation. Stefan's father is angry and calls the chief of police, whom he befriended when he was a public prosecutor. The duo get off the hook, and Stefan takes his bar exam only to walk out at the last minute to pursue his dream of owning a cafe on a beach.
