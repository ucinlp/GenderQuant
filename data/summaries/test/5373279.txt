Chaos reigns in the Catskills when Kavell  and Bergman , two college students who spend their summers working in the dining hall at Camp Oskemo, an upstate New York summer camp where they're the senior waiters, return. Serving food to bratty children doesn't interest them nearly as much as trying to make it with the female counselors at the camp, among them the pretty but chaste Vicki  and the beautiful and sexually liberated Evie . Kavell and Bergman also wage an annual war against the junior waiters with the help of deranged server Mad Grossman , but their real nemesis is Walrus Wallman , the camp owner who makes no secret of his dislike for the waiters. Over the course of one eventful summer, Kavell, Bergman, and their fellow food slingers dose the entire camp with amphetamines, taint the Kosher meals with pork, screen pornographic movies during Parent's Weekend, run a tank through the campgrounds, and destroy the waiter's housing and most of what surrounds it.
