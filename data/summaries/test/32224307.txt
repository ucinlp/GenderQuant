Oswald is riding on an ostrich, venturing the African jungles. Suddenly, his ostrich decides to make a stop, causing him to be thrown forward. While the disturbed Oswald let out his dissatisfaction, the large bird lays an egg. The egg hatches but the offspring chooses to go a separate path rather than to stay with its mother. Just nearby, an elephant was playing golf using its trunk as a club, and coconuts as balls. The elephant executes a shot but the coconut just veered away from the hole. After missing the next several shots without even scoring once, the frustrated golfer started striking the coconuts at random directions. One of them struck Oswald's ostrich, prompting that bird to quickly fled the scene. Oswald too was hit and was daze for a few seconds. Annoyed, Oswald confronts and tells the elephant to stop, threatening to attack. Not liking to be commanded by someone, the elephant gives a raspberry as Oswald turns around. Oswald then retaliates as he roughs up and wrestles the elephant to the ground. Momentarilly, the elephant's huge father came by. Seemingly intimidated by the larger pachyderm, Oswald helps the downed son get back on its feet. The smaller elephant walks away, leaving Oswald to face the wrath of its father. But Oswald wasn't actually hopeless as he reveals and opens a cage containing a mouse, much to the big elephant's panic. As the big elephant runs in terror with the mouse chasing, Oswald was laughing out loud. While he does, a squirrel silently walks by and kicks him from behind. Oswald chases the squirrel into a cave, only to be forced back out by something stronger. It turns out that the more powerful creature was a lion as it exited the cave. Oswald quickly made his getaway. While running from the lion, Oswald drops tacks on the ground but they barely slow down the big cat. When the two ran into a straw house, the tables were turned when Oswald got his hands on a shotgun which he fires at the lion. Upon running out of bullets, Oswald retreats and takes refuge inside a hollow log. To extract the rabbit from inside, the lion extends its scissor-jacked teeth into the log. Although the jaws closed on their target, the lion struggled to pull out Oswald who strongly refuses to be taken. Unfortunately for the lion, the scissor-extenders that connect to the teeth detach from its mouth. Returning the ordeal, Oswald uses the extendable teeth to bite back at the lion, and chases the big cat deep in the jungle.
