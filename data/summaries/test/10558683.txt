Carmela, Paulino, and Gustavete - who is mute as the result of an explosion - are a trio of traveling vaudeville performers. Among the chaos of the Spanish Civil War, they are in the town of Montejo, entertaining republican troops with their variety act. They are survivors motivated not exactly by patriotism but by a desire for self-preservation. Their show consists of four acts. It begins with Carmela singing and dancing a traditional song. The audience is enthusiastic during her performance, but the mood changes completely when the sound of approaching Nationalist planes is heard. When the planes just fly over, the show continues with Paulino reading a poem by Antonio Machado that introduces a note of patriotic fervor representing the feelings of the Republicans in 1938. The seriousness of the moment is followed by a comic routine in which Paulino twists himself into a variety of ridiculous postures in an attempt to break wind. The fourth and final act is a tableau vivant in which Carmela appears representing justice while Paulino brandishes the republican flag and they sing a song whose theme is freedom. The dangers and deprivation that they encounter in the Republican side encourage the trio to go to Valencia. To obtain the gasoline needed for the trip Carmela is required to distract a Republican truck driver while Paulino and Gustavete steal the fuel. They take the difficult journey on a misty night ending up running into the nationalist territory. Detained by a nationalist officer, they are incriminated by the Republican flag they carry in their car. Arrested and taken as prisoners, they are placed in the local school, which serves as the prison camp where the republicans are being held. Carmela befriends a fellow prisoner: a Polish soldier member of the International Brigade and is surprised that he has come to fight in Spain, a strange land whose name he cannot even pronounce. In an atmosphere of mounting tension and terror, some of the prisoners are taken away to be shot. Carmela, Paulino and Gustavete are driven away in an army car. They are convinced that they are also going to be killed, but instead they are taken to the local theater where they meet an Italian Officer, Lieutenant Amelio di Ripamonte. Surprisingly, the Lieutenant, learning that they are performers, wants them as a part of a show he has planned to entertain the Nationalist troops. They must stage a burlesque of the republic in exchange for their freedom. For the variety show to be performed for the nationalist, Paulino rewrites their old script. From the outset, the fiery and patriotic Carmela rebels, displaying her true convictions as an anti-fascist. However, Paulino persuades her that being their lives at stake she must go along with the performance. The day of the show both artists are indisposed as Carmela has her period, Paulino a stomach upset, the result of eating a rabbit which Gustavete, writing on his slate, now confirms was a cat. The presence of the Polish prisoners, who have been brought to watch the mockery of their ideals, greatly upsets Carmela, causing her to refuse to make the number with the flag. The show is similar to the one they performed before for the Republican troops. Musical numbers are followed by a poem, now read by the Lieutenant. The third act is a comic sketch, "The Republic goes to the Doctor", in which Paulino plays a gay Republican doctor who is visited by a female patient, the Spanish Republic, played by Carmela. Claiming that she has been made pregnant by a Russian lover, played by Gustavete, she invites the doctor to stick his thermoter in, but he is forced to confess that is broken. Carmela, increasingly irritated by the mockery of the Republic, decides to abandon the skit, throwing the fascist audience into a frenzy by displaying her breast and intoning the Republican party–line. A nationalist officer rises from the audience and shoots Carmela in the forehead. Gustavete, suddenly finding his voice for the first time, calls her out in an anguish, but Carmela falls to the floor dead. Sometime later, Paulino and Gustavete visit Carmela's rudimentary gravesite to decorate it with flowers and the latter’s chalk board, since Gustavete regained his voice when Carmela was shot. The only words here are spoken by Gustavete – "Come on, Paulino" – as he leads him away. As the two men take the road once again, the song "¡Ay Carmela!" is heard in the soundtrack.
