Ben Kalmen , a 62 year old man who was once a successful car dealer, has hit the skids due to bad business decisions and romantic indiscretions. He is broke, borrowing money from his daughter Susan , and unwilling to accept his age, a heart problem, and a continuing sexual appetite. Ben, who cheated often on his wife Nancy Kalmen , accompanies the 18-year-old daughter of his girlfriend, Jordan Karsch , to her college interview. Ben is an alumnus of the university and was even a building donor during his more prosperous days. Ben meets an impressionable student named Daniel  on campus who appreciates his wisdom and advice. Ben talks himself into bed with Jordan's daughter, Allyson . He expresses desire to continue the relationship, which Allyson dismisses as a one time experiment with an older man. Frustrated with Ben, Allyson flippantly tells her mother about the sexual encounter. Jordan breaks off contact with Ben and withdraws the support Ben needs to open an auto dealership. While discussing his past due rent with his building manager , his daughter Susan appears and tells him he is no longer welcome in her family's life because of his inconsistency and unreliability as grandfather of her son, and an affair Ben has had with the mother of one of her son's friends. Ben chooses to work at his college friend Jimmy Marino 's diner on campus. Allyson is upset to find Ben working near her college campus and informs her mother. He receives a call from Jordan, demanding that he move out of college town immediately. If he does not, Jordan tells Ben, she will have her ex-husband's Mob underworld contacts physically persuade him to do so. Unable to help himself, Ben makes a sexual advance toward a college girl, Maureen , whom Daniel has begun to date. Shortly after the girl rebuffs Ben, he is severely beaten by an ex-police officer  whom Jordan's ex-husband sent to the campus. He finds Nancy on the bench where they met, and she offers to give him a ride back to New York. The film ends with Ben looking at Nancy waiting in the car for his decision, watching a young woman walk by headed in the opposite direction, unsure which way he should turn.
