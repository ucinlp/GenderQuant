Made by combining footage from the original series with newly filmed material, it served as an "epilogue" to the original Ultraman television series, as Ultraman returns to Earth for one final battle. The plot of this episode picks up from Ultraman's defeat at the hands of Zetton. Zetton was destroyed by the Patrol and Ultraman is saved by Zoffy and has recombined with Hayata. However both Ultraman and Hayata are weakened by this defeat as well as suffering from a lack of confidence. Ultraman is being bested by other monsters and saved by the Patrol. The Patrol realizes they cannot count on Ultraman at this time and Hayata feels weaker. Arashi suggests Hayata use a stamina drink and Ide gets an idea and heads to his lab to build a new device. Hayata's ultra-senses divine the approach of a second Zetton attack fleet but before he can warn the Captain, Ide warns them of the fleet as he somehow knows it is coming. The patrol attacks the new fleet to minimal effect and another Zetton is defeated at their headquarters, but this triggers the revival of a previously defeated monster along with Pigmon. Pigmon warns them of what is coming and Ide can understand Pigmon perfectly somehow. Pigmon is again mortally wounded and this angers Hayata who triggers the beta capsule and becomes Ultraman. Ultraman wins, but now there is a simultaneous attack by several revived monsters. Ultraman then reveals a new power call Ultra Separation. He absorbs extra energies and creates replicas of himself who scatter to defeat the monsters. After this he reverts back to Hayata. Hayata is then alerted that Zetton 2 is attacking headquarters and transforms again. The fight goes bad for Ultraman due to his weakened condition and he hesitates to fire his specium beam. Ide reveals a new device which Arashi shoots into Ultraman's color timer. The device is a solar energy booster which fully recharges Ultraman. Ultraman then demolishes Zetton 2 with his rainbow spectrum colored specium blast.
