It is the late 5th century and Britain has been free of Roman rule for several decades and is vulnerable to outside enemies, particularly the Saxons. The British Isles are divided up into several kingdoms, each one ruled by kings and lords, and the one that starts to emerge as the most powerful, Camelot, is the focus of this historical fiction. The series starts off with King Uther's sudden death and chaos threats to engulf Britain. When the sorcerer Merlin has visions of a dark future, he installs the young and impetuous Arthur, Uther's unknown son and heir, who has been raised from birth as a commoner. But Arthur's cold, ambitious and tyrannical half-sister Morgan will fight him to the bitter end, summoning unnatural forces to claim the royal crown in this epic battle for not only Camelot, but all of Britain.
