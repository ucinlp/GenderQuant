The story is set in Dearborn, Michigan, during the 1950s, and revolves around sixteen-year-old Arthur Bartley  and his schoolmates, fifteen-year-old Janet Willard  and Ernie . While widower's-daughter Janet laughs at Arthur and Ernie's forays into smoking, drinking, and playing cards, she's always been interested in Arthur, and as Arthur's parents try to shelter him from negative things in life , he turns to Janet for comfort. The relationship between Janet and Arthur results in her becoming pregnant. Unable to ask their parents  for help, they turn to Ernie, who'd boasted earlier about "helping a sailor who got his girl in trouble" by directing him to an abortionist &ndash; only to discover Ernie made it all up, based on secondhand stories. The three seek together to arrange an abortion and raise the funds, only to be discovered by their parents at the last moment. In the meantime, Arthur and Janet find out how much they do not yet know about life &ndash; and how much they truly care about each other.
