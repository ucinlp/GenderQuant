Pattinte Palazhi movie is about Veena  for whom music was not just a passion, but it was her life. Aspiring to become a world renowned singer, she sets out on a journey where setbacks, broken dreams and losses await her. When she realizes with a shudder that the music within her has no ways of flowing out, she is driven almost to madness. But the music they say, always finds a way out. And it soon overwhelmed the whole world, as it surged out of her. Time stood in honor of her, and she was reborn. Those who knew her and who did not, competed for their share of her voice. Her father Sheshadri, Guru Usthad, Aamir who was in love with her, Dr. Aparna, Ganapathi, young music director Sreehari; all of them were after her. And she needed every one of them as well.
