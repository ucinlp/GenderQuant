The film opens on Rachel  and Hector's  wedding day in North London, England. Rachel's bossy mother Tess  and dazed dad Ned  are introduced. Luce,  who manages a flower shop, is the wedding florist. She also makes fast friends with Rachel's younger sister, Henrietta . However, as Rachel is walking up the aisle, her eyes meet Luce's and a connection is made. Some time later, Luce is invited to dinner with Rachel, Heck, and Coop , Heck's best friend and a perennial bachelor. Rachel suggests they fix up Luce with Coop, until Luce mentions that she's a lesbian. Heck takes this news in stride, and Coop is undeterred in his good-natured attempts to sleep with her. While Heck works long hours at his increasingly unsatisfying office job, he encourages Rachel to be friends with Luce. The two spend an evening together, visiting a football match and an arcade . At the end of the night, Luce walks Rachel back to her flat. Their goodbye grows awkward from tension, then Rachel leans forward to kiss Luce, but withdraws at the last moment and leaves. Over the next few days, Rachel continues to deny her growing attraction to Luce in an effort to remain loyal to Heck. For her part, Luce has no wish to break up a committed couple. Unable to deny what she is feeling, Rachel eventually confronts Luce directly at her flower shop. She tells Luce that a romance between them cannot happen, leaves, and abruptly returns seconds later to kiss Luce in the back of Luce's shop. Their foreplay gets interrupted by Heck, who has stopped by to pick up flowers for Rachel. He tells Luce that he has sensed the distance growing between him and Rachel and partially blames himself for not being there for her. Hearing this, Rachel runs off, later sorrowfully agreeing with Luce that they can't betray Heck. In the meantime, Heck reaches breaking point at his job and finally quits. When he returns home drunk, Rachel rashly confesses all to him without saying who her love is. Heck, who was feigning sleep, later calls Coop for support and Coop angrily confronts Luce after figuring out it was her Rachel fell in love with. Luce decides that being near Rachel without being with her is too hard. She makes plans to go on an extended trip out of the country, leaving care of her shop to her mother. When Rachel and Heck are celebrating her birthday at her parents', H tells them about Luce's trip. Heck then figures out that it was Luce who Rachel fell in love with after noticing her reaction to the news. Heck does not want to be her second choice or to live a lie so he leaves. She then confesses to her parents that she is in love with a woman and with their help, Rachel tracks down Luce as she takes a taxi to the airport. After getting stuck in traffic and Luce brushing her off on the phone, all seems lost. However, Rachel realizes Luce is in the same traffic jam and uses the lessons Luce taught her about yelling loudly to call to her. The two women reunite and kiss each other in the middle of a crowded London street. In a post credits coda, we see the characters some time later. Heck is on the plane to an unknown destination, all set to write his travel book, where he sits next to a young woman  for the 24 hour flight. There is an obvious and immediate attraction  between them. H and her young boyfriend are playing at a playground, Coop is seen holding a baby, and Luce and Rachel are still happy together.
