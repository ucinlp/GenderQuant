It is 1813. The South Essex Regiment has suffered terrible losses in the fighting in Spain and is in danger of being disbanded as a result. Major Sharpe  and Sergeant Major Harper  are sent back to England to find out why replacements have not been sent. During an audience with the dimwitted Prince Regent , Sharpe is introduced to Lord Fenner , the man responsible for the regiment's troubles. Fenner sends Lady Anne Camoynes  to sleep with Sharpe and ascertain his intentions. When he finds out, he sends assassins to solve his potential problem, but Sharpe and Harper dispose of them instead. Their bodies are tossed into the river and rumours are spread that Sharpe and Harper have been killed. Meanwhile, the two men "enlist" in the South Essex to find out what happens to the recruits. They learn that they are being trained by Lieutenant Colonel Girdwood ([[Mark Lambert  and then sold to other regiments by Sharpe's old enemy, Sir Henry Simmerson . Simmerson's niece, Jane Gibbons , helps Sharpe and Harper escape afterwards. Sharpe confronts Lord Fenner, but does not have any proof. Just in time, Lady Camoynes, who has her own grudge against Fenner, shows up with ledgers detailing the crimes and uses them for blackmail for herself and for Sharpe. Simmerson due to his influential friends, once more escapes prosecution. Sharpe gets the men he came for and goes back to fight in Spain, albeit with Colonel Girdwood in tow. In Spain, Girdwood is injured and Sharpe takes command of the South Essex, leading them on to victory. To shelter Jane from Simmerson's wrath, Sharpe becomes engaged to her.
