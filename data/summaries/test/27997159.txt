Vince Carden's hatred for Indians has caused an estrangement from his brother Paul and disappointment from wife Martha. A wagon train joined by Paul is attacked by braves in retaliation for a raid by Vince, and the only survivor besides Paul is a woman, Kate Mayfield, returning home from her education back East. Vince organizes one more attack, pitting him against not only the Indians but his own brother.
