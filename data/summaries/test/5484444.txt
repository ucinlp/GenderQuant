Successful British box manufacturer Charlie Blake  meets Sara Deever  when they both take a driver's exam in New York City. She tries to get a few answers from him, but he is the one who gets expelled for cheating. They run into each other later and go out on a date. When they return to her apartment, Charlie meets Alonzo , Sara's older, vegetarian friend. Then Richard  bursts in; he begs her to let him stay with her, but she has already packed his bag. After he leaves, Charlie asks her why he referred to him as his successor. She explains that she has a "special therapy program": She takes in a man for no longer than a month to diagnose and fix whatever problem he has. Richard was October, and she wants him to be November. She believes his trouble is his devotion to his work. Charlie accepts, though he is only interested in a short fling. He tells his employee, Digby , to send him a telegram after a week so he will have an excuse to leave. As November progresses, however, Charlie begins to fall in love  with the unorthodox Sara. When he gets the prearranged telegram, he telephones Digby to tell him to handle an important business meeting by himself. Clem Batchman , another of Sara's projects, shows up, inciting Charlie's jealousy until Sara informs him that he just wants to introduce her to his fianc√©e, Carol . Charlie becomes troubled by certain signs that Sara may be ill. When he asks Alonzo, his worst fears are confirmed: Sara has only a little time left. She lives as she does so that she will be remembered after she is gone. Charlie tries hard to get her to break her self-imposed rule, and believes he has succeeded. She later admits to Alonzo that, unlike all the others, she has fallen for Charlie, but wants him to remember her as she is now. Thus, when December  arrives, she has secretly packed November's bag. Charlie reluctantly leaves, promising he will never forget her.
