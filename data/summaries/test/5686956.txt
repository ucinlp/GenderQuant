Set during World War II, Stan and Ollie try their hand at various business ventures. Their store opens and closes in various guises but without success. They finally open it as a bicycle store but some German spies trick them into partnering the business so that they can use it as a front for a base. Stan and Ollie volunteer as air raid wardens but keep messing up until they are fired. They soon discover that the spies are planning to blow up the local magnesium plant and in the end are heroes as they scupper the plan.
