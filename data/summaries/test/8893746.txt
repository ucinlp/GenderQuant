Directed by Patri Ferreira, The Impatient Alchemist follows the efforts of two men and their investigation of a mysterious death. When Vila , a disillusioned psychologist-turned-cop, accompanied by his partner Chamorro , find a bound-and-gagged body of a nuclear plant worker in a motel room, the pair head off to interview the plant worker and the victim's wife. Though the case is closed fairly quickly, the body of a woman who had been partially devoured by wolves is found and believed to be connected to a mob boss named Vasili . The first case is re-opened when the detectives discover that the employers of the victims were two dubiously run companies vying for dominance.
