Hidden Agenda depicts the investigation of the British assassination of Paul Sullivan , an American civil rights lawyer and political activist in Northern Ireland, whilst he was accompanied by a Provisional Irish Republican Army sympathiser. Investigator Peter Kerrigan' s  interrogations, assisted by Ingrid Jessner , the dead man's girlfriend and colleague, reveal that the two men were shot without warning, and that there is a mysterious tape recording involved in the killings. The tape was made by Captain Harris , who recorded senior military leaders and Conservative party politicians discussing how they arranged the rise to power of Margaret Thatcher. Eventually, Cpt. Harris gives a copy of the tape recording to Jessner, but British security forces kidnap and kill Harris, and blame his assassination upon the IRA. Without Harris to authenticate it, the tape recording can be dismissed as a forgery. At story's end, Kerrigan is blackmailed into silence about the wider conspiracy; Jessner still has the tape recording, and, presumably, will reveal it, but shall not be believed.
