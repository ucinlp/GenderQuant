Betty responds to an ad for employment , along with an enormous group of fellow applicants. When the interviewing manager asks Betty what she can do, Betty replies in song that she can't type or take dictation, but that she can provide other benefits. The businessman sends the other applicants away via a trap door, and hires Betty. Betty is happy with her new job, but the boss soon takes liberties with his employee. Scared, Betty calls for help. The police arrive on the scene, making several futile attempts to enter the building. They finally whittle down the skyscraper by firing machine guns into it. Betty and her boss appear in silhouette behind the window shade, but when the shade is raised, the two are locked in an embrace. Betty exclaims "Fresh!" and pulls the shade back down for some privacy.
