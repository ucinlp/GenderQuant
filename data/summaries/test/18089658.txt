The story is set in 1950s Iraq and illustrates the plight of Juamer in a flashback structure. When Juamer's wife goes into labor, he runs to get the midwife but is caught in the midst of a clash between Kurdish protestors and Iraqi police. He is mistakenly arrested, tortured and sentenced to ten years imprisonment. After his release, Juamer sets out to find his loved ones but he discovers that his wife died, without medical help, on the same day that he was arrested.Jani Gal, Review by Robert Koehler, Variety, Jan.17, 2008.Jani Gal: Synopsis.Alphabetical Film Synopsis, Moondance International Film Festival, 2008.
