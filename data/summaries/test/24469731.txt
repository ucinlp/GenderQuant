A former prostitute is in charge of a successful men's magazine. An obsessed admirer systematically slaughters her models  and supplies the mistress with pictures of their disfigured corpses taken in front of her semi-nude posters visible in the background. The more he kills, the closer the killer gets to slaughtering his obsession.
