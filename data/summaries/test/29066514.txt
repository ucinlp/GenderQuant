Porky Pig has arranged the screening of a film in a cinema campaign. The public goes to the ticket booth. A chicken buys tickets for herself and her three "children" . A kangaroo tears the tickets  and throws them in his pouch. A firefly usher leads the audience with his hindquarters as bright lamp. A skunk has a "scent"  and cannot enter, so he goes through the back door. On stage Porky presents the film he made himself. The accompanying music is a version of the flickering that usually introduced cartoons of Looney Tunes. The film turns out to be a series of small sketches of primitive characters drawn wire stick figures, minimalist, with settings that seem to have been penciled by a child. After the film, Porky is surprised to see the theatre in shambles the only audience that remaining is the skunk .
