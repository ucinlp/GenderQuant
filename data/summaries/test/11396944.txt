Spike and Tyke walk into the backyard to have a barbecue. The first attempt fails because the charcoal blows up. On the second attempt, Spike puts on too much charcoal on the barbecue, the result which lets of a cloud of dark smoke when Spike blows into the charcoal to get the fire going . He however claims this to his son that a bit of Hickory smoke always keeps in good barbecue flavour. On the third attempt, the steak is instantly burnt to a crisp. Spike retrieves another steak, but by this time Tom and Jerry have appeared on the scene with Tom chasing Jerry as usual. Jerry repeatedly hides in items involved in the barbecue: the bag of charcoal, Spike's hat, the salad, the pepper shaker, and the bread. This means that every time Tom pursues Jerry, he is interfering with the barbecue. Each time this happens, Spike furiously chases Tom off, so that Tom ends up in the swimming pool.  Spike finally manages to prepare the meal, and he and Tyke sit down to eat. Tom and Jerry are no longer seen from this point. However, at this point a group of ants called the Ant Army spots the food and approaches the picnic table. Spike grabs the food, putting it wrapped up like a bag and he also grabbed Tyke and flees to the diving board. The diving board and Spike and Tyke gets shakier as the Ant Army gets closer. Then they push them into the pool while the food goes back to the ground where the Ant Army retrieves it. Spike returns to the ground and grabs the steak from the ants who are carrying the food back. But at this time, the lead ant blows his trumpet as the Ant Army retrieves it.
