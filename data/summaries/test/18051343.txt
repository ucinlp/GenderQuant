The story begins with WALL-E running his hand through the rings of Saturn while hanging on the side of EVE's ship, as shown in the original film. One of the rock particles that swirls away begins to increase in velocity as it moves up against the atmosphere of a Saturnian moon, becoming a meteorite that destroys a small lamp spire outside the starship Axiom. A repair robot named BURN-E is dispatched by SUPPLY-R, a storage robot that dispenses spare lamps, to replace the broken lamp. Before he can secure the new lamp, EVE's ship enters the Axiom{{'}}s docking bay. Still hanging on the side of the ship, WALL-E waves to and distracts BURN-E while the loose lamp floats off into space. BURN-E retrieves another spare from SUPPLY-R, who is reluctant to let it go, and begins welding it down around the same time WALL-E is launched in an escape pod set to self-destruct in the original film. The pod explodes and BURN-E turns in surprise, accidentally slicing off the lamp with his blowtorch. Annoyed, SUPPLY-R gives BURN-E the last spare lamp , which he finally manages to install successfully. By this point, WALL-E and EVE fly into the Axiom through the only available entrance near BURN-E, which closes and locks him out. Later, WALL-E and EVE are nearly jettisoned through a garbage airlock, which BURN-E tries to use to reenter the ship but is closed as soon as he reaches it. BURN-E gives up all hope and begins playing with his blowtorch when it dawns on him that he can use it to cut a hole into the ship, and he does so. BURN-E returns to SUPPLY-R to turn on the newly installed lamp. At this point, the Axiom{{'}}s captain and autopilot AUTO get into a fight and the ship is tilted, throwing BURN-E outside again. The captain deactivates Auto and realigns the ship, but as BURN-E prepares to go back inside, the ship blasts into hyperspace and pins BURN-E to the side of the hull. The Axiom lands on Earth and BURN-E reenters to find the ship deserted. BURN-E spots SUPPLY-R through the window of an escape pod and waves to him, but accidentally launches it and crashes to the ground below near SUPPLY-R. BURN-E flings off the pod's hatch and finally turns on the lamp, which is then crushed and destroyed by the falling hatch. BURN-E collapses in despair, leading SUPPLY-R to try to console him after the end credits by patting him on the head and saying, "There, there," in a dull, monotone voice.
