Matt Sorenson , a former boxer and San Francisco cop, now makes a living collecting debts for small businesses. The brutal death of his high-powered younger brother, Michael, changes all that forever. Intent on finding his brother's killer, Sorenson infiltrates the powerful inner world of politics, business intrigue and casual sex. Rejecting the police and media theory that the murder is the work of a female prostitute, Sorensen's focus falls on the corrupt big city businessman, Jim Conway. His obsession to discover the killer's identity mounts as a series of other men are found murdered in a similar fashion. Sorenson loses all objectivity and becomes a vigilante.
