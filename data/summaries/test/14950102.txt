The setting of the film takes place at John R. Rogers High School in Spokane, Washington. Ten years prior, student Abel Frye took his life through suicide. A victim of bullying, Frye ended his life by hanging himself on the school property. Fast forward to the current day, several student football players  are becoming gravely ill. Just before they fall into a coma, each victim is heard screaming the spirit's name. Abel Frye. In an effort to get to the bottom of the haunting, the school turns to the Veritas Project for help. The Veritas Project is made up of the Springfield family, including father Nate , mother Sarah , daughter Elisha , and son Elijah . The members of the Springfield family are highly trained paranormal investigators who work undercover to unravel mysteries and discover the truth about paranormal activities. The high school students in the film represent members from each social class or youth subculture, including jocks, geeks, and goths. Prominent among the students in the film are members of the goth culture, who worship the ghost of Abel Frye. The group of goth students is led by Norman Bloom, who unbeknownst to the rest of the school, is Frye's nephew. In retaliation for the bullying and mistreatment of the goth students, Bloom enacts revenge on the popular football players. Bloom's plan includes gaining access to the locker of each targeted bully and placing a deadly male spider, trapped in a straw. Bloom then gives the bully tainted money, upon which he placed trace amounts of female spider pheromones. When the unsuspecting bully reached into the locker between classes, the waiting male spider would be easily attracted to the pheromones, then crawl out and bite the student. Among the side effects of the toxin, the affected student would experience hallucinations, believing that the ghost of Abel Frye is after them. At one point, Bloom additionally puts a female spider in one of the straws by accident, which resulted in thousands of deadly spiders overtaking the school. Elisha Springfield, attending the school undercover as a student, eventually figures out the mystery and the diabolical plot designed by Bloom. In fear of being discovered, Bloom attempts to keep his involvement in the haunting hidden by poisoning both himself and Elisha with a spider, hoping that they will both die. When Elijah figures out that Bloom is behind the sinister attacks in the school, he races to find his sister and the Springfield family rush to professor and scientist, Dr. Algernon Wheeling , who saves Elisha with an antivenom. In the end, the students at Rogers High School are protected not only from haunting and harm from others, but from the harm brought on by their own hatred and fear, as well.
