William Shatner plays the role of Aidan Carvell, a businessman running for Congress as an independent candidate with what is presented as a broadly libertarian agenda. Unknown to the public, Carvell is training and arming a militia force. Though the purpose of this private army is never wholly specified, a general sense of sinister intent is established. Carvell's political campaign manager Frank Jennings  is persuaded by the FBI to assist them in indicting Carvell for treason. Carvell sets out to punish Jennings for this betrayal, requiring Jennings to fight for his own safety as well as that of his family.
