The Lambda Lambda Lambda from Adams College are packing their suitcases to get ready for a national fraternity convention in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Just before heading to the airport, Lewis'  best friend Gilbert  explains to him that he feels stupid that he cannot come, due to breaking his leg . After arriving at Fort Lauderdale and heading to the Royal Flamingo Hotel, A trainee named Sunny  informs Lewis that their reservation is canceled and has been given to the Alpha Betas. The Royal Flamingo manager  explains to Sunny that they do not want nerds staying in this hotel. The Tri-Lambs also meet Stewart , a geeky bellboy at the hotel who is also friends with Sunny. Lewis finds another hotel called the Hotel Coral Essex, located in a shady neighborhood, and makes their reservation there. Roger , the president of the local chapter of Alpha Betas  is seen planning with his fellow jocks to get rid of the Tri-Lambs by any means necessary. Furthermore, Ogre  is revealed to be at the conference, scheming with Roger and the Alphas. The Lambdas arrive at the Florida swamplands hoping to attend the United Fraternity pre-conference barbecue. They take the wrong way and see a group of Seminole Indians capture an Indian maiden and throw her into a flame . They are captured and forced to strip to their underwear, until Poindexter  tests their ethnicity by yelling "Bite my crank" at them in Seminole, to which no one responds. They're chased off by Ogre, and forced to make their way across town back to their hotel in their underwear. The next day, Roger announces a new bylaw to be voted upon by the conference; "Proposition 15", a rule that would require physical as well as academic standards to be met by all members of the conference. Before Lewis can make any argument against the proposition, he is co-opted by a wet-nightie contest happening poolside. The Lambdas decide to beat the Alphas at their own game and throw a party at the Hotel Coral Essex. The neon sign outside the hotel is deliberately broken , which draws people for miles. The Tri-Lambs  perform outside of the Hotel Coral Essex, winning over the crowd, and Prop 15 is voted down the next morning. At this time, Roger, seemingly sincere, expresses a desire to make peace once and for all with the Tri-Lambs, and to that end he proposes a bylaw stating that any fraternity found to be guilty of a crime will be expelled from the national conference and their charter revoked. The Lambdas, satisfied that the Alphas now cannot attack them without being expelled from the conference, accept their offer of friendship and their luxurious hotel suite at the Royal Flamingo. Roger encourages Sunny to grab a couple of girls and take the Tri-Lambs to the beach in his car. While on the beach Sunny and Lewis get to know and like each other. Unfortunately, Roger has reported his car stolen, and the Lambdas are arrested. Stewart and Sunny bail the Tri-Lambs out of jail. Sunny apologizes and tries to explain that she knew nothing of Roger's plan, but Lewis doesn't believe her. Before she can explain, The Alpha Betas kidnap the Tri-Lambs along with Sunny and dump them on an uninhabited island. Disgusted by Roger's actions, Sunny jumps overboard. When they realize Ogre cannot be trusted to keep his mouth shut, they also throw him into the water, despite the fact that he cannot swim. Upon seeing Ogre drowning, Wormser jumps into the ocean and rescues him, though he is seemingly ungrateful. As the group sleeps Lewis has a dream about Gilbert, who explains to him that all is not lost and implores Lewis not to give up. He also points out the Lewis is acting like a jerk to Sunny, who is stranded with him on this island by choice. This helps give Lewis the confidence he needs to apologize to Sunny for his behavior and to try and find a way off the island. The next morning The Tri-Lambs, using their combined intelligence and ingenuity, find a Cuban military officer's hidden cache of military supplies, including an amphibious vehicle. Meanwhile at the conference, Roger is presiding over the vote to expel the Tri-Lambs, when, decked out in military gear, they literally crash the conference, driving right through the conference room wall, then chase the attendees out to the pool. Roger is unfazed and tries to continue to have the Lambdas voted out for stealing his car, until Sunny reveals that Roger set them up and kidnapped them. Roger states that it doesn't matter since he will always be cool, popular and good-looking and the Lambdas will always be weird, different and pathetic, and that there's nothing they can do or say about it. Lewis takes a moment and quietly agrees with Roger, stating that there's nothing he can say, but that there is "something I've gotta do about it." and punches Roger in the jaw, knocking him into the pool. Back at Adams College, in an induction ceremony, Ogre is sworn in to Lambda Lambda Lambda as the newest member.
