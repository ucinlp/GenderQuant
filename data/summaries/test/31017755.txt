For their first day on the job as the new protectors of Metro City after defeating the deranged villain Titan, Megamind  and Minion  are selling off their gadgets from their evil lair to the citizens for good purposes . All of their items get sold . As for the Dehydrating Gun, it gets sold to a boy named Damien, who accidentally uses on his mother and turns her into a cube. Megamind tells Damien to soak the cube in water to get her back to normal. After the auction is over, Megamind reveals a suit he created that contains all of Metro Man's powers, which he will wear to protect Metro City. Minion finds a seemingly harmless button that had also not had been sold. Not knowing what the button does, Megamind pushes the button, and it reveals a giant robot called the Mega Megamind, which Megamind put his evil self in. The robot thinks that Megamind is Metro Man, and starts attacking him. Megamind fights the robot with his new powers, but is defeated. He and Minion hide in the Invisible Car. Megamind decides that they should live in the car from then on, because he programmed the robot to not stop until the hero  is destroyed. Minion reveals that he still kept the Spiderbot, a robot that Megamind wanted to throw away, suggesting that Megamind should try to be a hero his way rather than try to do the job the way Metro-Man did it. Megamind plans to lure the Mega Megamind to a spot where the Death Ray shoots . However, Minion realizes that he cannot activate the Death Ray because the control buttons were broken. He then tries to find the Death Ray remote control, but Megamind does not remember what the remote looks like, so Minion tries all the remotes. Megamind, trying to hide, eventually is found by the Mega Megamind . Minion finally finds the remote and activates the Death Ray. Megamind and the Spiderbot get off the robot, using the robot's wrist-mounted shooter just before the robot explodes. The duo then recover the Dehydrating Gun from Damien, who not only has not re-hydrated his mother, but used it on the parents of several other children, which are now having a party to celebrate no longer having to do as they are told. Megamind re-hydrates the parents with a glass of water to ensure that the children will face punishment of their actions. The short ends with Megamind and Minion seeing a signal in the sky  and riding off in the Invisible Car as they are called to action.
