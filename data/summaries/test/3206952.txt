A film director and his son start a journey towards Koker, the place where half of the film of Where is the Friend's Home was filmed. During the first half of the film they try to find the right highway to reach the village since most of the roads have been damaged or blocked by the earthquake, meanwhile they cross paths with several locals that have experienced the damage and ask directions often to reach their goal. After changing the route several times they finally reach one of the villages in which the film was staged, they visit one of the actors of the first movie and stay near him for a while. Both father and son visit the destroyed village and hear more stories of those who survived, among them a young married couple that lost their relatives in the disaster but decided to marry anyways since the dead did not foresee their demise, so in answer they prefer to live on and marry. The scene with this couple is a focal point of the third film of the Koker trilogy, Through the Olive Trees. Later on they find one of the kids that played a part in the film and take him to the tents where most of the people whose house were destroyed in Koker stay. The son of the director wants to watch the final match of the Football World Cup with the other kids and his father decides to leave him there and come back later to pick him up. He discusses there with other people that were victims of the earthquake and finds out amazed the spirit they have to move on with life. As the director struggles to reach the town in his car, he passes a man carrying a tank and goes up to a hill until the engine gets too hot and he is unable to continue. The man with the tank helps him to restart the engine and then he seemingly leaves as the man goes uphill walking. The director's car races several meters before trying to climb the hill again and after he makes it, the director picks the tank-man with him. With this scene, the movie goes black.
