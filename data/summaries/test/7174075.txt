Betty falls asleep doing a jigsaw puzzle of Alice and the white rabbit. She "awakes" just in time to follow the rabbit through the looking glass into a modern wonderland. Betty meets most of the traditional inhabitants of Wonderland and sings "How Do You Do"  to them. When the Jabberwocky steals Betty away, everyone comes to her rescue. Betty wakes up back in her living room, just in time to prevent the white rabbit from again escaping from her puzzle.
