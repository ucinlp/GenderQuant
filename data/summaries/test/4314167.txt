Although Michael has matured well since the first film, he still feels that by birthright he deserves to start at the top of his father's law firm, whereas his father tells him that he will start him as a job clerking in order to learn the profession from the bottom up. Michael takes a summer vacation with Tommy to Australia. Michael has big plans to show his cousin Tommy a good time aboard a luxury yacht, until he discovers that the yacht he chartered is actually an old, rusty fishing boat. But when modern-day pirates  chase the fishing boat, the boys are forced to jump ship, leaving them stranded on a desert island with the boat's captain, Jake Hunter, who scuttled the fishing boat to lose the pirates, and later admits he hated being a fishing boat captain and only stuck with it because his dad loved it. In the end they escape in the pirates boat and leave them stranded on the island. As they escape they call the Australian Coast Guard for help. The pirates are arrested and their speedboat is seized. During a lunch the boys have with Michael's father and Tommy's mom, Michael arrives and tells Jake and Tommy that Frakes's boat is now theirs and that they are going to start their own charter business owned by all 3 of them. Michael also tells his father that he will return home to take the job offer in his law firm.
