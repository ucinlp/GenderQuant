The early part of the film follows the experience of a late 19th century journalist, known as "the writer", who races through London to be reunited with his wife in Leatherhead as an army of Martians attacks the planet, driving in massive Tripods and taking control of the Earth. The film also shows the adventures of his brother, who accompanies two women to the coast of England in an attempt to escape the aliens.
