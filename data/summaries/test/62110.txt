They quickly get married. Jim loses his job at Drake, when he clashes with the owner , and takes a job with another outfit, flying a very experimental aircraft. Ann soon finds out how dangerous her husband's occupation is, but she promises Gunner that she will stick to her man. Jim wins the race, but Benson, the man Drake sends in Jim's place, dies, leaving a wife and three children behind. One day, Gunner accompanies Jim on a test flight of a new bomber . Something goes wrong; the bomber goes into a spin and sandbags  break loose, pinning Gunner.

When Jim realizes the toll his job has taken on his wife, he gives it up.
