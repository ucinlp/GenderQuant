The movie opens in the New Mexico desert, with the mutants from the first film having captured a woman who is being forced to breed mutant children. As soon as she has given birth, Papa Hades  smashes her head in with a rock, killing her. Nearby, a group of scientists working in the desert hills are attacked by Letch . It is also hinted at the beginning of the film that the surviving members of the Carter family from the first film were not killed by Papa Hades' mutant clan and managed to escape the hills. Some time later, a group of National Guard reservists in training are sent into the hills to resupply the scientists, who are working for the Department of Defense on installing a surveillance system . The soldiers arrive to find the camp apparently abandoned, with no sign of their commanding officer or any of the civilians, with outside radio contact impossible due to the topography. When the radio operator, Spitter , picks up a faint distress call, the sergeant  organizes a rescue mission, leaving behind Napoleon  and Amber . The search party discovers the mutilated body of a scientist in the hills, while Amber and Napolean pull another mutilated and dying scientist from beneath the portable toilet. On her way to join the group, Amber is attacked by Stabber , but a returning  Mickey  drives him off. Just as Napoleon catches up, Mickey is pulled into a bolt-hole and killed. At the same time, the remaining troops are also attacked by Letch, leading to the sergeant being killed by Spitter's friendly fire. Spitter himself is later killed by an unseen mutant sabotaging his rappelling gear. The troop soon locates their commanding officer, who has clearly become unhinged from recent events. He warns them of the mutants' plans to capture women for breeding and kill everyone else, then commits suicide. With their remaining gear stolen, the team is forced to try to find another way down the mountain. In the process, Missy  is captured and taken into the tunnels by Chameleon , where she is raped, while the remaining troop chases after her. They manage to kill mutants Chameleon and Grabber , but Stump  and Delmar  are also killed. Crank  is also killed by a trapped crate of dynamite. While in the mines, the troop locate a non-violent mutant named Hansel ([[David Reynolds  who eventually shows them the way out of the mines, but Amber insists on returning to find Missy. They find and free her, then have a final showdown with Papa Hades. The final three National Guard troops—Amber, Napoleon, and Missy—make their way out of the mine, seemingly alive and safe. However, the epilogue text in the closing scene indicates that none of the guardsmen were ever found, and at least one mutant is seen alive, and making use of the high-tech surveillance equipment to watch the survivors.
