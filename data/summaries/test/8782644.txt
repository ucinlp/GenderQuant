The film is set in Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose's home in Falta, masquerading as Uttarpara. It deals with the story of a girl Anindi and her family , lover  and few neighbours. Nature, tradition and love are Anandi's pillars of support in difficult times. Her brother will slowly drift away with bad or risky companies, will not return home one day, and will be lost forever. Her parents will die heartbroken and her sister will get married suddenly and will leave the family. Babua will go abroad and marry somebody else. It is implied that Anandi is forgetful of her sorrows that she was deceived by Babua  whom she loved most. Babua comes back from abroad only to say: 'Anandi, I came back to set you free.' Bhalo Theko has a non-linear pace with frequent jumps between current time and past. Film critics described Anandi as a large canvas painted in several hues. She stands against rootless internalisation and perplexed culture. A poem by a renowned Bangladeshi author and scholar Humayun Azad named "Shuvescha" was recited in the ending of the film by Anandi while wandering lonely in their garden.http://www.thedailystar.net/2004/10/24/d41024140395.htm/
