The plot, about bank robbers held at bay by the Los Angeles Police Department, is based on a real incident which occurred February 28, 1997 known as the North Hollywood shootout. Homicide detective Frank McGregor  tracks a violent duo of bank robbers: Larry Eugene Phillips, Jr. and Emil Mătăsăreanu. The film opens with scenes of police officers getting ready for work in the morning interspersed with scenes of the robbers Phillips and Mătăsăreanu preparing to loot an armoured bank truck. Officer Donnie Anderson  is mourning the death of his police officer father. He displays a lack of attention on his SWAT assignment and is forced by his superior to take time off. Meanwhile, the staff at the North Hollywood branch of Bank of America are preparing for start of business. Phillips and Mătăsăreanu park outside the branch and wait for the armored truck. They are frustrated when the truck does not turn up and decide on robbing the branch instead . They wear black masks and enter the branch firing at the roof with their AK-47s. An LAPD patrol car happens to pass by at the same time. The officers spot the robbers entering the bank and call it in. The manager is forced to open the vault and fill a duffel bag with all the cash in the branch. When the robbers are turned away from him the manager places a stack of notes with the dye used for tracking purposes. By the time Phillips and Mătăsăreanu collect all the cash, numerous LAPD patrol cars and officers surround the branch and roadblocks are set up. The robbers spot the officers and exit the branch firing their weapons. The officers are unable to stop them because of their low-caliber weapons and also since the robbers are wearing heavy armor. Donnie listens to the call on his radio, gathers his SWAT team and races to the shoot-out location. After several minutes of firing and injuries to both and civilians, Phillips and Mătăsăreanu decide to make a getaway. Mătăsăreanu drives their car while Phillips walks beside the car firing at the officers. On Archwood Street, Phillips separates from Mătăsăreanu and starts firing at the officers following them. While reloading, his rifle malfunctions. He draws his pistol and shoots himself through the chin. At the same time he is also shot by Frank. Mătăsăreanu car-jacks a 1963 Jeep Gladiator pickup truck after the tires on his getaway car are shot out. However, he is unable to start the truck since its driver abandoned the Jeep and took the keys. The SWAT team corners him and he takes cover behind his car. A close-range gun battle ensues. The SWAT team fires below the cars at Mătăsăreanu's legs since they are unprotected. Finally he goes down and surrenders. It is later shown that he bleeds to death. The closing scenes are real-life images of LAPD officers receiving medals of valor and the public sending them thank-you notes and flowers in appreciation of their heroic effort.
