A dog left out in the cold desperately seeks shelter in a dog house, a hawk's nest and a turtle shell, but is rejected every time. He finally stumbles upon the home of Pepe Le Pew, who is currently out. When he returns, the dog unsuccessfully tries to get rid of the skunk. Pepe's stench forces him out in the snow again, and he returns with a cold. Pepe meanwhile wants his home back, and tries equally in vain to make him go away with his stench. However, thanks to his cold, the dog can't smell a thing. After being forced out, Pepe throws the dog a note which reads: WARNING! A COLD CAN BE FATAL! SEE YOUR DOCTOR NOW! The dog hurriedly phones a Dr. Gesundheit, and Pepe promptly appears in disguise as the doctor. He tries putting a mustard plaster on the dog's nose and ripping it off, which doesn't work. Pepe next tries a steam machine, which after several tries, works, ridding the dog of his cold. Pepe now successfully gets rid of his unwanted guest with his stench. The dog returns thawing himself out and again with a cold. Pepe runs off and returns with a cold himself. The pair finally agree to live with the colds and each other since neither can get rid of the other, and as they sneeze,they say "Gesundheit!".
