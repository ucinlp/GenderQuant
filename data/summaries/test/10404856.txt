The French secret agent Josselin Beaumont is sent to Malagawi, a fictional African country, to kill the ruling dictator, Colonel Njala. However, before he manages accomplish his mission, the political situation changes drastically and the French secret service resorts to handing over Beaumont to the Malagawian authorities. After a long and unfair trial, during which Beaumont is injected drugs, he is sentenced to long-term penal servitude at a "re-education camp". After a daring escape with one of the inmates he returns to France and informs the French secret service of his presence, promising that he will kill Njala, who is in France for an official visit, thus getting his revenge on the people who betrayed him. The secret service responds by setting other agents on Beaumont's trail, however he manages to remain one step ahead, humiliating and killing some of the major betrayers, including the sadistic chief of the secret police, Rosen. After the chief falls in a gunfight, Beaumont switches their ID cards, spreading confusion within the secret service and temporarily reducing Njala's guard. Beaumont eventually gets Njala killed, by tricking the secret service into shooting the dictator. As he finally tries to escape by slowly walking towards the helicopter of the presidential whore, Beaumont is shot by the French government.
