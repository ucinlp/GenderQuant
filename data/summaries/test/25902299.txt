A British couple visits Assam looking for the graveyard of the man’s grandfather who was once a tea planter. With a view to drawing international attention, an underground rebel group kidnaps the couple. But being unable to communicate with the foreign couple, the outfit picks up an educated but frustrated youth who is fluent in English. Eager to be a part of that so-called “movement” of the group, the boy readily jumps in. But inside the hideout, Manab, the protagonist, discovers that the idea he had of the militant group and its “struggle for independence” was entirely wrong. He decides to help the British couple escape. In the process he is killed in a crossfire with all the militants present in the scene.
