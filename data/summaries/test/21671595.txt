Iva and Marija, who are a lesbian couple, rent an apartment in Zagreb in a building that seems to be quiet and a safe environment for their love. But as time passes by, the atmosphere in the house gets more and more aggressive. Elder Olga is dominating the house. Other tenants include her calm husband and her grown-up son Daniel , the prostitute Lidija, an abused housewife, a widower keeping the corpse of his newly deceased wife, a gynecologist performing abortions in one flat of the house and an ex-soldier who regularly plays martial music at night. The characters are meant to display the madness of the post war Croatian society. The conservative religious father of Marija is secretly tracing his daughter and pays Lidija to try to seduce Iva, which fails. After Olga finds out that Iva and Marija are lesbians, the situation escalates in rape, murder and kidnapping.
