A young athlete aspiring to become a professional basketball player must make some tough decisions in this sports melodrama. Kyle Lee Watson  is a talented basketball player who is about to graduate from high school. While he waits to find out if he will receive a scholarship to Georgetown University he finds himself in a difficult dilemma over a playground basketball tournament. He must decide whether to play for and follow his good-hearted basketball coach or Birdie , a local thug in the neighborhood. Kyle is also feeling resentment towards a security guard named Shepherd, or Shep , because his mother is falling in love with him. Coincidentally, Kyle's coach also wants Shep to coach his team when he feels its time for him to retire, since Shep was previously a star basketball player himself. It is later revealed to Kyle that Shep is Birdie's older brother. Due to the death of a friend, Nutso, Shep cannot bear the thought of playing again.
