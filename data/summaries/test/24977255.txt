Purebred rough collie Lad and his owners, Stephen  and Elizabeth Tremayne , are visited by their wealthy neighbor Hamilcar Q. Glure  and his 8-year-old daughter Angela , who is crippled from polio. While Lad befriends the girl, Glure invites the Tremaynes to show the prize-winning Lad at his upcoming dog show. However, Glure is jealous of Lad's success and has rigged one event to have such specialized rules that he believes only his recently purchased high-priced, English-trained collie can win. During the competition, which involves directing the dogs through a tricky set of a maneuvers, Lad is able to complete the course, while Glure's champion does not recognize the hand signals Glure makes while holding a cigar. Later, Lad saves Glure's daughter Angela from a poisonous snake by knocking her backwards to get her out of harm's way, then fighting and killing the snake, getting bitten in the process. Her nurse  initially does not see the snake, and begins beating Lad for "attacking" the little girl. Distraught, Angela stands and walks for the first time since her illness to stop the nurse's abuse of her friend. Lad disappears for three days, reappearing covered in mud but cured of the poison. After his return, Lad is bred with another prize-winning collie, Lady, and they have three puppies. Angela is allowed her choice of one as a present to her when they are old enough to leave their mother. However, Jackson White , a poacher Lad fought and chased off the property before, sets fire to barn out of vengeance. Elizabeth is injured and all of the pups are killed except for Wolf. Lad later aids in capturing White when he breaks into the house to try to steal Lad's gold trophy from the dog show. Angela is initially inconsolable over the loss of her puppy, and refuses to have anything to do with Wolf. After he is nearly lost in another accident, she changes her mind and accepts Wolf as her new dog.
