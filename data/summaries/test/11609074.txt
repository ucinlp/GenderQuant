This episodes begins with Tom trying to eat Jerry in a log cabin. Jerry got sprinkled in pepper, which cause him to sneeze. Tom notices Jerry in the Cuckoo clock. Tom turns the clocks hands up to 5:00 and he waves to Jerry. He did it the second time and turns it up to 4:00 and he licks the mouse but the third time when he turn it up to 3:00, instead of Jerry, a bomb pops out. Tom swallows it and explodes inside his mouth. The title cards are shown with Tom and Jerry skiing. In the Alps, Tom is knocked cold while chasing Jerry. However, he is revived by a St. Bernard dog with a keg of brandy. The alcohol makes Tom drunk. He starts seeing hallucinations, like five Jerrys. Tom counts "1, 2, 3-*HIC*". He sees hallucinations of a hole. He seems to see countless holes. Tom hiccups to the real hole, causing him to get frozen solid, requiring the St. Bernard's assistance once again. After several attempts, Tom escapes with Jerry to a tropical island, where he is knocked out by a falling coconut. Fortunately, help is on handâ€”the St. Bernard appears once again to revitalise Tom. Tom once again becomes intoxicated and meanders out to sea, with the rescue hound and Jerry waving goodbye and "The End" appearing on a red circle.
