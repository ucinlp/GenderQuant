The film begins with a group of carefree teenagers on a camping trip. As they spend the night drinking and hanging out, a light appears overhead. Jean is the first to notice something wrong when she videotapes a UFO overhead. At first her friends do not believe her and are not convinced about the tape. That night while they are sitting around the campfire the aliens attack. Four flee for their lives, Jean still clutching the camera, but cannot escape and they are suddenly abducted by a UFO. They wake up in a cell on the ship. Jean uses the camera's night vision to explore the alien glyphs and passages. They eventually rounded up and pushed into a room where they are tied down and vivisected. Jean awakens in a hospital, suffering from terrible flashbacks. That night a shadowy figure sneaks into her room and staples something into the back of her neck, causing the flashbacks to stop and leaving Jean with no memory of the abduction. Jean is questioned by a staff psychiatrist, Dr. Booker, who reveals that she is in a special facility for UFO abductees. She has to remain there until they are certain that she can resume a normal life. The military attache, Commander Shakti, wants her lobotomized. Jean breaks into another wing of the hospital to find her friends and discovers that part of the hospital is reserved for mutants, the insane and the lobotomized. She sees a woman having her skull drilled. Jean is then captured by Shakti and given electric shock therapy until she is unconscious. When she wakes up, Shakti interrogates her and then sends her to an execution room. Jean lobotomizes the nurse instead and disguises the nurse as herself, by covering her with gore. She wanders around the basement, looking for a way out through the vents, until she finds an empty storage room. She explores the area, eventually finding her things in a box labelled with her name. She also finds her video camera with the tape missing, but still with its memory stick. She replays the video and is shocked to see the entire abduction on tape. She escapes the storage room, killing a guard on the way. She also sees and tapes a scientist tending alien larvae in a lab and a scientist masturbating the aliens' genitals to extract sperm. Jean breaks into a worker's locker room and disguises herself. There she runs into her doctor Thomas. She finds out the aliens have escaped and are infecting the facility. When the infected are killed alien larva cracks out of their skulls and escape. Jean and Thomas try to save her friends but they are a mess and Todd barely remembers Jean. Jean just gets them to safety when Todd turns on them. Thomas shows Jean the way out and reveals that the hospital is actually part of the alien ship. Todd kills Britney and Thomas and an alien larva bursts out of Thomas' head just as he dies. Jean is captured by an adult alien, but she shoots it in the throat. Later, Jean finds herself in another lab, looking at a series of human clones of her and her friends. Shakti explains that Jean died in the abduction and she was a clone. Jean, furiously kills her clone by pulling out its umbilical cord. Dr. Brooks fakes removing jean's memory suppression chip, used to keep her memory erased before returning her home. Shakti orders the clones of her friends be resurrected as well. However, since Dr. Brooks faked the procedure Jean's memory was never erased. Jean, Todd, Bud and Britney suddenly find themselves hiking in the woods on a sunny day, when a search and rescue helicopter spots them. They tell rescue team that they are fine. An army officer asks Jean: "Where have you been for the last two weeks?" The movie ends with Jean giving him a cheeky look.
