In 1870 Galveston, Texas, a shipment of $100,000 being transported by stagecoach is the object of a tug-of-war between Zack Thomas  and Joe Jarrett , who first must stave off an outlaw band led by Matson . Thomas and Jarrett become rivals in a bid to open a waterfront casino. Each has a new romantic attachment as well, with the beauties Elya  and Maxine , respectively. They eventually must join forces to hold off the villainous Matson and a corrupt banker, Burden , to keep their new gambling boat afloat. The role of Elya was originally intended for Sophia Loren who had already worked with Sinatra in The Pride and the Passion. Although she was offered $1,000,000 for four weeks of work, Loren turned the part down.{{fact}}
