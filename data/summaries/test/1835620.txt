Ellen Arden , a photographer and mother of two small children, has been declared legally dead, having been lost at sea in the Pacific. Her husband Nick  has remarried; he and his new wife, Bianca , are on their honeymoon when Ellen, rescued from an island where she has been stranded for five years, returns home. The family dog remembers her, but the children do not. However, they take a liking to her, and invite her to stay. Ellen assumes a foreign accent and pretends to be a woman named Ingrid Tic. Nick, flustered by the revelation that he's now married to two women, makes great effort to keep the truth from his new wife all the while trying to quash her amorous advances. Upon learning that she was marooned on the island with a man, Stephen Burkett  — whom she knew as "Adam" to her "Eve" — he becomes jealous and suspicious of her fidelity. To calm his fears, Ellen enlists a meek shoe salesman  to impersonate her island companion.De La Hoz, Cindy: "Marilyn Monroe — Platinum Fox", Page 232, Running Fox. ISBN 0-7624-3133-4.
