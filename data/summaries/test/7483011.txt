Firelight follows a group of scientists â€“ particularly Tony Karcher and UFO believer Howard Richards - as they investigate a series of coloured lights in the sky and the subsequent disappearance of people, animals and objects from the fictional American town of Freeport, Arizona. Among those kidnapped by the Aliens are a dog, a unit of soldiers and young girl named Lisa, whose abduction induces a heart attack in her mother. The film has sub-plots involving marital discord between Karcher and his wife Debbie and the obsessive quest of Richards to convince the CIA that alien life does not exist. The twist comes as the Aliens, represented by three shadows, reveal their purpose: to transport Freeport to their home planet Altaris and create a human zoo.
