The Virgin Spring tells the story, set in medieval Sweden, of a prosperous Christian whose daughter, Karin  is appointed to take candles to the church. Karin is accompanied by her pregnant maid servant, Ingeri , who secretly worships the Norse deity Odin. Along their way through the forest on horseback, the two part, and Karin sets out on her own. Ingeri encounters a one-eyed man at a stream-side mill, converses briefly with him, and then flees in terror. Karin meets three herdsmen , and invites them to eat her lunch with her. Eventually, the two older men rape and murder Karin . The two older men then leave the scene with Karin's clothing. The younger  is left with the body to watch the sheep. He obviously takes the situation poorly because he quickly becomes sick with guilt. The herders then, unknowingly, seek shelter at the home of the murdered girl. Her parents, played by Max von Sydow and Birgitta Valberg, discover that the goat herders murdered their daughter when the goat herders offer to sell Karin's clothes to her mother. In a rage, the father locks the trio in the chamber and kills them. The next day, the parents set out to find their daughter's body, with the help of Ingeri. Her father vows that, although he cannot understand why God would allow such a thing to happen, he will build a church at the site of his daughter's death because his conscience is forcing him to atone. As her parents lift her head from the ground, a spring begins to flow from where she was lying. Ingeri then begins to wash herself with the water, and Karin's parents clean her muddied face.
