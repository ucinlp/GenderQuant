The film begins with a woman and her dog living in a destroyed train-station during a war we never see. The location, setting, and compositions of the film are similar with most other films by Daryush Shokof in which the location, situation or both is confined to one place with universal elements as if it could be any place on earth. The woman confronts strange happenings throughout the film as the intensity of the incidents increase in danger until she finally meets Satan himself who wants to finish her off. She decides to poison Satan by feeding him wild mushrooms in the woods and in the hope that he would have heavenly visions to suffocate him to death.
