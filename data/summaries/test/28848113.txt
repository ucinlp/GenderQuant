Hyo-jeong is a co-host of a shopping channel lingerie show, but after losing her job to her younger and more glamorous rival, she takes the advice of an old friend and enrolls in a week long intensive course at a strange, secluded yoga centre. There she meets her four classmates and their mysterious trainer Na-ni, who informs them about the 5 rules they have to obey for the week. The rules are, 1. Not to shower within an hour after training, 2. Not to eat, 3. Not to communicate with the outside, 4. Not to look at mirrors and 5. Not to go outside. One by one they start to break the rules and suffer the consequences.
