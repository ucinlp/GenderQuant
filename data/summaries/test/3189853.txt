 The story concerns 13th-century Saxon nobleman Walter of Gurnie , who, after sparking an unsuccessful rebellion against the Norman conquerors of his homeland, sets out to seek his fortune in the Far East. In the company of his friend Tristam , Walter makes the acquaintance of megalomaniac Mongol warlord Bayan . The "Black Rose" of the title is the beauteous Maryam , with whom Walter fell in love while both were prisoners of Bayan. Journeying farther east, Walter and Tristam arrive in China, where they are treated with deference - so long as they never try to leave. Eventually escaping his Chinese hosts, but leaving the Black Rose behind, Walter returns to his native country. Previously denounced by King Edward  because of his role in the a Saxon rebellion, Walter is welcomed back with open arms because of all the cultural and scientific wonders  he has brought back from China. Bayan sends the Black Rose to England to join Walter there.
