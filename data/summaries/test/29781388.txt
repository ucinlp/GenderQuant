The year is 1886, and Sergeant Bugs is assigned to protect a Cavalry outpost, Fort Lariat, from invaders. Yosemite Sam, accompanied by local Indians, attempts to invade the fort and fails on several occasions, aggravating the Indians in the process. The story concludes with Bugs and Sam in the middle of a clash between the returning Cavalry and the Indians. Bugs manages to escape into a hole in the ground, while Sam does not-he and his horse are "flattened" after being caught between charging US Cavalry and Indians.
