Fawn Deering  is a college student researching animal mythology and human sexuality. This project leads her to Dr. Jade  for an interview on the subject. While at Dr. Jade's Manor, she meets Adam ([[Brad Armstrong  and is immediately drawn to him. Sophie the maid ([[Missy  warns her to leave Jade Manor and never look back, but Fawn cannot resist Adam's invitation to return that weekend to observe a bacchanal. Sophie tries to get Adam to leave Fawn alone and not share their curse, but Adam has fallen in love with her and does not want to live without her. Unfortunately, this means that Fawn will have to become a Satyr like the rest of them. While the transformation takes place, Fawn spends most of her time sleeping and having visions where she sees Adam is his Satyr form. After Fawn is completely transformed, she journeys into Adamâ€™s room where they profess their love for each other. Adam finally realizes that he is cursing Fawn for the rest of her lifetime, and sets out to return her to human form.
