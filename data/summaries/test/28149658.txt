Oskar , a popular TV weather forecaster, suddenly wakes up to an altered sense of identity: rather than belonging to easygoing wife Zuzana , he feels he ought to belong to the whole wide world – hence the national embarrassment. His first entanglement is with babysitter Kocicka , a lean teenybopper who's more attached to her pet turtle than her older lover – at least until he accidentally smothers it in the dryer. Next in line is mature pop icon Nora , who's about to teach him a thing or two about freedom: the more people you let in, the more alone you end up feeling.
