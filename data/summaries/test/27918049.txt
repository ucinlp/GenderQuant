The plot focuses on several killings along Houston's I-45 corridor between Houston and Galveston; the crime investigators on the case; their sacrifices and personal mission to protect the innocent; plus their stake out to find the killer of the fictional character or victim in the movie. The film's screenplay was loosely inspired by true events surrounding the murders of women kidnapped from cities spread along 30 plus miles of I-45 corridor and dumped in many areas to include numerous bayous surrounding the oil fields of Texas City, Texas. While in real life there have been numerous itinerant serial killers involved over the years, the movie focuses on specific local Texas City suspects. In reality, the local moniker "The Killing Fields" applied to a specific abandoned property with acreage in League City, Texas known as Calder Drive. It was not the setting of this movie. {{Citation needed}}
