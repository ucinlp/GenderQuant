Peter "Junior" Potter  has graduated from Harvard and now heads west to the town of Sawbuck Pass to claim his Daddy's fortune. When he gets there, Junior discovers to his horror that practically everyone in town claims to be owed a debt and that his father's treasure chest is empty. Junior stalls the townfolk for as long as he can. He makes the acquaintance of a singing cowboy named Roy  and a sexy saloon performer with the masculine name of Mike , who has to fend off Junior's persistent advances. A mysterious masked bandit known only as "The Torch" has been leading midnight raids, meanwhile. What the wise-cracking, clueless Junior doesn't know is that the object of his affections, Mike, is in fact The Torch, and that Roy is a government agent with a Smith and Wesson Model 320 Revolving Rifle hidden in his guitar case, bent on capturing her.
