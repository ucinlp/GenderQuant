Then, he commits suicide. Since then, the footage of the murders has disappeared. In the present day, horror movie director, Ikuo Matsumura , decides to make a film about the massacre. As the date of the shoot draws near, Nagisa Sugiura , the actress who is set to star as Professor Omori's daughter Chisato , is haunted by the ghosts of the victims. She begins to hallucinate as she is plagued by nightmares of the killings. Yayoi Kinoshita  wakes up in the middle of a psychology class, in which the professor publicly opposes the ideas of reincarnation and "cryptomnesia". She decides to write an essay supporting cryptomnesia and meets Yuka Morita , who was shown auditioning at the beginning of the movie. Yuka says she remembers things in a "past life" of hers and reveals a mark that would appear to be evidence of strangling on her neck, which reveals that she has the same vision as Nagisa, but that "had been there since [she] was born."Reincarnation, English subtitles. Yayoi and Yuka check out the college library, but mysterious forces dragged Yuka away. Meanwhile, Nagisa begins to believe that she is the reincarnation of Chisato Omori until she finds someone else in the cubby where the little girl was slain.

With all the victims walking towards Nagisa, she then becomes shocked that she is the reincarnation of the homicidal professor. Bound in a full-body wrap, Nagisa is haunted by the souls of her previous incarnation's children. Ayumi Omori , the professor's wife, gives Nagisa her childrens' favourite toys . She screams as they are shoved into her solitary confinement cell, but calms down with a sinister smile on her face as the ghosts of the children closed in.
