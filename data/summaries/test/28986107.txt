At the Scientific Research Institute for the study of Homicidal Baked Goods, The Gingerdead man is visited by a woman from the FBI , who is revealed to be the sister of Toothless McHomeless of the second one, who was driven to suicide by the previous Gingerdead cookie. As she's about to take her revenge on this "half baked piece of shit", a group of activists for animal rights break into the institute, overpower her, and release the Gingerdead Man and the rest of the baked inmates. The killer cookie comes across the "Time Travel Studies" room, shoots the two scientists, and is sent back through time as security tries to kill him. He is sent back to a Roller Disco Beauty Pageant in 1976, and can not get the remote to work to get him out. He then goes on a massive killing spree, killing three car washing bimbos  by hooking up the hose with hydrochloric acid, melting all three of them. He heads back inside, and when he tries to get one of the employees, Ingrid Harshman  to suck his through a glory hole, she rips it off and eats it. He continues on and discovers the Club's ugly janitor having a threesome with two drugged teens  and kills them by piercing them with a nail gun. He then kills one of the Clerks  with a meat cleaver, and mixes up the DJ 's cocaine with cleaning product. Meanwhile, two kids, Pickles  and Tina  discover the remote, manage to get it working, and they are sent traveling through time. Meanwhile, the club's owner  has to close it down due to taxes, and invites her odd niece , who possesses the power of telekinesis, to help her pack up her office. While there, she meets one of the clerks  and skates with him, and is recognized as one of the best skaters at the club, to the dismay of both the aunt, who because of her skating talent, caused the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the four-year winning champion . When she discovers she'll lose the vote, she has her boyfriend  set up a bucket of pig blood to fall on the niece's head during the ceremony. The Gingerdead Man messes up the prank and the bucket falls on her instead. The cookie then kills her and her boyfriend in front of everyone with a meat cleaver, and shoots three people  dead. When the cookie shoots the owner in the shoulder, the niece freaks out, locks everyone in the club and electrocutes them all, killing everyone except herself, her aunt, the clerk and Ingrid. As the cookie's about to finish them off, Pickles and Tina return from time-traveling with the FBI Agent and Security, along with Adolf Hitler, Charles Manson, Jeffrey Dahmer, and Lizzie Borden, all four who's reason of insanity was because they were possessed by a homicidal baked good. All six time travelers overpower the cookie, and shove him into a cookie jar, killing him. Pickles and Tina reveal to the aunt the winning numbers for the lottery, which is enough to keep the club up and running. Pickles and Tina also reveal that because they warned the FBI Agent about the attack on the Institute, the events of the entire film never happened. Everyone who has died comeback to life, and the time travelers go back to their own time period, including the aunt, who goes back in time to prevent herself from causing Pearl Harbor.
