The setting is the Old West town of Paradise, Nevada, where a young woman, Mercedes Murphy , co-owns and operates a combination saloon and dance hall called the Red Hen with her business partner, Slick Barney (played by [[Jack Richardson . Her little half-sister, Olive "Live" Sumner , who is crippled, lives with her and she makes every effort to protect the child. A tough, but good-hearted businesswoman, Mercedes shows a tender side at home with Live. Her partner, Slick, and a cowboy called the Heller (played by [[John Gilbert , who has a heart of gold, are both interested in Live. A reform movement comes to Paradise with the arrival of Reverend Gavin McGregor , who wants to clean up the town and sets up a church next to the saloon and dance hall. Initially, Mercedes is opposed to the church and there is immediate antagonism between her and the reverend. He and Mercedes come to respect each other, however, and she is so impressed by his sermons that she closes down her business. When her little sister is sexually abused, Mercedes blames the reverend and is filled with wrath. She begins a vigorous attack on the church and goes gunning for him. But the Heller discovers that it was actually Mercedes' partner, Slick, who compromised Live's virtue and shoots him dead. After Mercedes learns that it was Slick and not the reverend who betrayed Live, she and the reverend become friends. She closes down the saloon and dance hall permanently and prepares to leave town with Live. The reverend then professes his love for her and begs her to stay.
