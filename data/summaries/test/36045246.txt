After having triplets, Mae  and Rendy  plan to raise their children without paying heed to input from their family or friends. However, Mae begins feeling a postpartum depression; to help her, Rendy asks her childhood friends Beni , Guntoro , and Eman  to secretly help her. Unaware that Rendy asked them to do this, Mae keeps what they do a secret from Rendy, as she thinks he still wants to raise the triplets without outside input. Mae's parents also begin helping after seeing Beni, Guntoro, and Eman with the babies. Rendy realises that the babies have begun to prefer Mae's friends and parents to himself, causing him to feel inadequate as a father. To keep Mae's parents away, he invites her grandmother Nyai  to live with them. She and Mae's father Babe  do not get along, so her presence is hoped to keep Babe away. This goes too far, however, as Babe leaves in a fit of anger, which causes his wife  to fear that he may divorce her. When Mae discovers that Rendy was the one who brought Nyai over, she tells him to leave. After Mae realises that Rendy was trying to help her, she calls Beni, Guntoro, and Eman and tasks them with improving Rendy's confidence. They succeed, and Rendy is able to help Babe and Nyai work out their differences. Both Rendy and Mae's families, as well as Beni, Guntoro, and Eman, help raise the triplets.
