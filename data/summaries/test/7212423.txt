High school outcast Eddie Weinbauer is writing a letter to his hero, metal musician Sammi Curr. He puts the letter in an envelope and starts doing his chores. He watches the news at the same time when he hears the worst words to ever reach his mind: Sammi Curr has died in a mysterious hotel fire. He is completely devastated. He goes to his friend "Nuke" , a DJ who knew Sammi Curr personally. To take Eddie's mind off the death of his idol, Nuke gives Eddie the only copy of Curr's last and only unreleased album on an acetate disc. Once back home, Eddie falls asleep while listening to the record and has a strange dream about the fire that killed Sammi Curr. When he wakes up he finds that the record is skipping and after listening to it for a few seconds he comes to realize that there is something not right about the words the record is stuck on. Having previous experience with hidden lyrics, Eddie plays the record backwards but receives more than he imagined: Sammi Curr speaking to him from beyond the grave. Sammi instructs him on how to go about getting revenge on a group of bullies that like to torment Eddie, since Sammi was bullied constantly in high school and would like to take the revenge on bullies he never got to take himself. At first the revenge is innocent enough, but after a while the plans start to become more sinister, eventually starting to involve murder, and Eddie finally tries cutting ties with the dead rocker, but Sammi will not let him. Eddie accidentally spills some soda on the record which causes an electrical surge that gives Sammi just the amount of energy he needs to get out of the record and become able to carry out his sinister plans without the help of another; the only setback is that Sammi can only travel through radios or anything else electronic, so, no radios, no way for Sammi to carry out his plans. Eddie goes on a path to destroying every radio he sees to prevent Sammi from carrying out his plans.This leads to a final confrontation between Eddie and Sammi. Eddie finally lures Sammi  to a police car and starts dissing and insulting him until he breaks out and tries to attack Eddie from behind a gate in the car. Eddie drives the police car off an unfinished bridge, short-circuiting the tape, thus, destroying Sammi.
