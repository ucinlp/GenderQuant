The film, which is violent and sexually graphic, is a high-speed coming of age story which centers on three young men dreaming of an escape from their provincial surroundings by means of a motocross career: young motocross racing champion Rien , another racer who thinks he has the goods, Hans , and the son of a Bible thumping Calvinist, the mechanic Eef . Their only escapes are alcohol, drugs, and weekend visits to a local disco nightclub. When they run into a young seductress , her homosexual brother, national motocross champion Witkamp  and the national press that follows in his wake, their futures change drastically.
