Prosperous Alec Walker  puts up with a loveless marriage to Maida  until he meets widow Julie Eden . They fall in love and he asks his wife for a divorce. She refuses; as she goes on to tell him, she married him solely for his social position and wealth and won't give them up. She is such a skillful liar that she has Alec's parents  convinced that Julie is out to destroy the marriage. Julie breaks up with Alec since she cannot see any future with him. On Christmas Eve, a distraught Alec gets drunk, falls asleep in a hotel room in front of an open window, and catches pneumonia.

When Maida shows up and tries to see Alec, Julie blocks her. With no one else in the room, Maida freely admits she gave up the man she really loved for Alec's position and his father's wealth. However, Alec's parents enter behind her and overhear her cold-blooded admission. Maida's plotting exposed, the path to Alec and Julie's happiness is now clear.
