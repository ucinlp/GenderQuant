The coastal town of Hampton Bay is threatened when a 35-Foot Great White Shark starts chomping up their vacationers. Days before the annual Regatta celebration, the townspeople are faced with financial ruin if something isn't done about their newfound Shark problem. If that wasn't enough, the owners of the local amusement park have been subject to a hostile takeover from a prospective businessman looking to cash in on their prized property. It's up to the Sheriff, the Park's Owner, and a Shark Expert to head out and destroy the Shark before the summer economy is slashed and the park is left for the bulldozer.
