Race car driver Mike Reardon and his mechanic Tommy Trehearn are the best of friends. Their friendship is damaged however, when Reardon's girlfriend ends up falling for Trehearn. Years later, Trehearn and Reardon's now-ex-girlfriend Chris are now married with children and move to Arizona when Reardon is selected to be a mechanic for a new racing team, which Reardon also happens to be apart of. Somehow, Tommy must do more than win the big race.
