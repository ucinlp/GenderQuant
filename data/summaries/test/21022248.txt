{{Expand section}} An honest, religious engraver, Anargyros Loumbardopoulos , has routinely invested his money in gold coins, specifically British gold sovereigns, bought from a friend of his, a banker. Upon having stored away 100 sovereigns, a friend of the banker suggests that Anargyros mints counterfeit sovereigns, but he adamantly refuses. The banker's friend then introduces Anargyros to a lady that he knows. Anargyros' resistance is soon curbed, and he spends all his invested 100 sovereigns to buy minting equipment.
