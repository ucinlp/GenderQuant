Honey Shayne  is a freshman at Fairenville University . After unsuccessfully pledging the Pi sorority, and being publicly ridiculed by sorority president Melody Ragmore , Honey joins with three other unsuccessful pledges  to form a new sorority  with the goal of stealing all of the rival sorority's boyfriends. The movie includes a number of competitions intended to accomplish that goal, including a fundraiser , a dance and a climactic game of strip football. Both groups play pranks on the others and attempt to avoid disciplinary actions from the F.U. administration. A subplot deals with the attempts of two bungling gangsters to recover money hidden in the renovated building housing the sorority. A running gag during the movie is the source of the name "H.O.T.S." While the closing credits reveal that the name is an anagram of the first names of the four founders, other characters in the film believe it to stand for Hands Off Those Suckers and Hold On To Sex. At one point, the girls claim it stands for Help Out The Seals.
