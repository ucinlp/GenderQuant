In Madrid, in the mid 1950s, Paco, a handsome young man from the provinces serving the last days of his military service, is in search of both a steady job and lodging. He is engaged to be married to Trini, his commandant’s maid. Trini is not only sweet and pretty, but also has saved a sizable amount of money through years of hard work and frugal living, which will enable her and Paco to start their lives together comfortably. With a factory job lined up, Paco moves out of his barracks and look for somewhere to live until the wedding. He is referred by Trini to Luisa, a beautiful widow who periodically takes in boarders and rents him a spare bedroom. Besides supplementing her income with boarders, Luisa engages in swindles with underworld contracts, and is not above cheating her partners by skimming money off her illicit earnings. Instantly smitten by Paco, the attractive Luisa quickly seduces her new tenant. Paco, frustrated by his unfruitful job hunt and by Trini's refusal to sleep with him until they are married, offers little resistance when Luisa seduces him, initiating an affair. He is dazzled with the sexual delight to which she introduces him. So intense is Paco’s attraction for Luisa, that he abandons Trini for long periods, finally showing up at the commander’s house to spend Christmas Eve with her. Trini begins to feel a distance between herself and Paco, and while the couple is strolling in the street, she is surprised to see the “old widow” and immediately guesses that she and Paco are having a relationship. Trini seeks the advice of the commandant’s wife, who tells her that she should use her own sexual powers to win Paco back. Waiting for Luisa to leave the apartment, Trini goes to Paco’s room and gives herself to him, making sure that Luisa later sees her leaving. At first, her tactic works and Paco reaffirms her love for her and they leave to visit Trini’s mother in her village. However, Trini is no match for her rival as a lover and Paco cannot get Luisa out of his mind. When they come back to Madrid, Paco is willing to continue his twin relationship, but Luisa, who knows of Trini’s existence, is wildly jealous of her rival. Things become more complicated for Paco by Luisa’s shady business dealings with Minuta and Gordo, members of a gang of swindlers whom she owes money. They have threatened her life and Paco, attempting to aid his lover, suggests that he get the money by swindling Trini of her savings. Luisa would prefer that they simply kill Trini and proposes that Paco should marry Trini, then steal her savings and run away with Luisa. Paco uneasily agrees. The plan is for Paco to propose marriage to Trini and bring her to the provincial city of Aranda del Duero where they have planned to purchase a bar. Under that pretense, Paco and Trini leave Madrid. Luisa follows them, unsure of Paco’s resolve. While Trini is asleep, Paco steals the money from her handbag. He offers it to Luisa but pulls out of their plan to flee together. Luisa refuses – it is Paco she wants - and, driven by guilt, he returns to Trini to explain the situation. After the disappearance of the money, Trini realizes the fraud and understand that her love for Paco is doomed. When Paco comes back to the hotel room and confesses the plan, Trini tells him she prefers death to abandonment. Thwarted in her attempt to cut her own wrist with Paco’s razor, she begs him to kill her since that is what he really wants. Later, as the two sit in the rain on a bench in front of the cathedral of the town, Trini hands Paco the razor. In despair, she asks Paco to kill her. He stabs her and rushes to the station to prevent Luisa from leaving. His bloody hands signal to Luisa that the mission has been accomplished. The couple embraces passionately on the platform as the train pulls out. A title informs viewers that the police captured the pair three days later.
