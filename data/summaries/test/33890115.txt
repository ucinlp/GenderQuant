Talented young singing and dancing duo, Moana and Eva are performing as Butterfly Crush at Circular Quay in Sydney, when a riot engulfs their show. Moana awakes at the Dreamguides, a cult with which Eva has recently become involved and learns that the riot was just a virtual dream. Their dream to enter the Australasian Song Awards and become the next big thing starts to evaporate, as Eva slips further into the Dreamguides under the pull of the cultâ€™s magnetic leader, Star, who tries to take control of the duo's management. Despite her distrust and suspicions about the cult, Moana finds herself being drawn in by attractive young cult member, Matt, as he shows her how the virtual dreaming technology and physical relationships can combine to create a new experience of passion. Deceived and controlled by Star, Eva quits the duo. Moana realizes she must find a way to turn the tables on Star, if she wants to get Eva and Butterfly Crush back. She attempts to trap Star but it backfires when Star succeeds in undermining her faith in herself, leaving her badly shaken and wandering Sydney, lost and dazed. Moana and their manager, Angel, force Star to allow Eva to participate in the Awards, which they win. Matt decides to leave the cult and escapes his cult minders to join the duo to celebrate the win.
