Joe  and Paul Fabrini  are independent truck drivers who have their own small, one-truck business. The Fabrini boys constantly battle distributors, rivals and loan collectors, while trying to make a success of their transport company. Overworked Paul falls asleep at the wheel causing an accident that costs him his right arm. Meanwhile, Joe is romancing a local waitress Cassie , but is being seduced by Lana Carlsen , the wife of trucking executive Ed Carlsen . Lana, now in love with Joe, murders her husband and makes it look like an accident. She then offers Joe one half interest as a partner in Carlsen's organization. Initially bitter, Paul eventually gets over his self pity and returns to work after Joe is made partner of the company, now as a dispatcher for the Fabrinis' company. Joe accepts but turns away from Lana's sexual advances and says he plans to marry Cassie. This enrages Lana who then accuses Joe of plotting Carlsen's murder. However, eventually, the tide turns when Lana becomes hysterical on the witness stand and breaks down and confesses everything. The case is dismissed because the only witness  is insane and Joe reunites with Cassie.
