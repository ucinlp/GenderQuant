Professor Jim Tanner, a biochemist, discovers evidence of a person with psychic abilities among his co-workers in a research laboratory. His colleagues include geneticist Margery Lansing, physicist Carl Melkinen, biologist Talbot Scott and chairman N.E. Van Zandt, all working for Navy officer Arthur Nordlund. After a warning from Henry Hallson that one among them possesses a super-intelligence capable of destruction and mind control, Hallson is found murdered with the name "Adam Hart" scrawled nearby. His widow Sally Hallson says it is the name of a childhood friend. Tanner is the prime suspect of a police investigator named Corlane. As he tries to uncover the superhuman, his associates are methodically murdered until Tanner faces a showdown with the killer, an apparently undefeatable opponent. In the end, Nordlund is revealed to be Adam Hart. Hart's psychic assault awakens Tanner's own latent psychic powers, and Tanner kills Hart. Tanner realizes that he was the superhuman uncovered by Hallson's tests, and that Hart was trying to eliminate any competition from others like himself.
