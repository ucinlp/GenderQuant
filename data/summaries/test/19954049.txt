In The Attic Door, two siblings, a brother and sister, are left alone in a far-flung and desolate area of the American Old West. Every day, the siblings endeavor to maintain the family farm, apprehensively waiting for their parents' return. Having no place to escape to, the brother and sister discover that they are not completely alone on their farm. They repudiate the truth that something behind their attic door is now awake but must now face brave their greatest fear. The Attic Door is a story of the "love, loss, loneliness, and the truth behind childhood fears."
