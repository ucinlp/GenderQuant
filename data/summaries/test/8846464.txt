Master Sergeant Dan O'Farrell is a G.I. on an island somewhere in the South Pacific during World War II, bemoaning the consequences of a ship torpedoed while ferrying to the island a desperately needed cargo of beer. Among his problems are the Navy personnel making life difficult for him and his Army buddies, an officer trying to emulate John Paul Jones, a hoped-for delivery of morale-boosting nurses turning out to be six men and the ugliest woman  ever to wilt a bouquet of flowers, and a Japanese soldier who has hiding from everyone else ... and hiding something else as well.
