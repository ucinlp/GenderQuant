Yosemite Sam  is rowing the sea towards a castle. The villagers spot him and retreat to the castle. Bugs hears the commotion, peeks out of his hole and decides to fight the invader. While Sam terrorises the castle, Bugs begins confronting Sam calling his outfit a Halloween costume, taking the sword from him and denting and kicks Sam out of the castle. Later Bugs paints a door on the castle walls and Sam mounted on a pink elephant tries to smash the "door" down, but instead knocks into the stone wall where the door was painted. Sam scolds the elephant for failing, but the incensed elephant becomes angry at Sam and repeatedly slams him to the floor. Next Sam has the elephant catapulting rocks over the castle walls. Bugs sprinkles pepper on the elephant, making it sneeze a rock right on Sam. Later Bugs orders the bridge to be lowered. Sam appears and mounted on the elephant charges across the bridge, but the bridge can't hold their weight and they both fall through into the moat. Sam then tries sailing in the back way  to enter via the back. Bugs awaits and plugs the elephant's nose with a cork, forcing him back to land for air and forcing Sam to use his hat to sail back to shore, where he furiously chases away the pink elephant. Frustrated, Sam tries to dig his way into the castle under one of the towers, but the tower falls on top of him. Next Sam attempts to blow open the castle door with dynamite. When Sam tries to leave, the drawbridge has been raised at the other end and Sam is stranded near the lit explosives. After the door blows open, a tattered Sam rushes into his former elephant who has defected to Bugs and then chases Sam away with a club. With that Sam gets to his boat and leaves. Bugs reveals he bribed the elephant with peanuts.
