The film follows two days in the lives of a group of 15-year olds from a mixed-income area of West London. The story focuses mainly upon Trevor, known as "Trife" , and Alisa  who is pregnant by him. Other characters are less developed. The school bully, Sam Peel , is the main antagonist. Another student, Katie , is being physically and emotionally bullied by a group of girls led by Shaneek , and is separately threatened by Sam. Her parents do not know the extent of the bullying. After being picked up from school, a distraught Katie flees to her bedroom, writes a note, and hangs herself. The students are then given a day off for mourning, but instead prepare for a party. Trevor and his best friends: Jay , and Moony  spend the day stealing, trying to talk to women, drinking alcohol, and smoking cannabis. Alisa and her friend Becky  decide to get drunk and high before the party, despite Alisa's pregnancy. Alisa has recently discovered that she is pregnant and she is unsure as to how to cope with the news. Becky takes Alisa to an older man's house where they perform sexual acts in return for drugs. Becky is the instigator and Alisa feels that she has to follow her friend's actions. Meanwhile, the boys trick their way into Sam's house in order to retrieve a Game Boy he had stolen earlier, they then proceed to steal Sam's cannabis and Jay has sex with Sam's girlfriend, Claire . When Sam returns and threatens them, the boys overpower him, attack him, and escape along with Claire. In the process, they knock Sam's mother to the floor, which is later used as a pretext for revenge by Sam. Alisa and Becky arrive at a shopping centre, having sold their drugs to buy new dresses. They meet up with Moony and Jay; Jay tells Alisa that Trevor doesn't want her or the baby, and that she should get out of Trevor's life. Alisa decides to return home alone as Becky wants to stay with the boys. In the meantime, Trevor has gone to meet up with his Uncle Curtis . He sees Katie's brother, Lenny  at Curtis's house, but they do not speak. Trevor tells Curtis that he wants to work for him, and is then issued with a revolver, which Trevor had previously made by drilling the barrel of a starting pistol on a pillar drill at school. Trevor is then taken downstairs to a tied up man, Andreas, who is being tortured for failing to stick to an agreement about payment. Andreas is earlier seen purchasing drugs from Curtis. Curtis orders Trevor to cut the man's face with a Stanley knife. Trevor carries out the order, but then flees from the house, throws the gun into the river and goes to find Alisa. Alisa is on her way home when she sees a classmate, who persuades her to come to a party with him to cheer her up. Trevor arrives at the party, finds Alisa, and confesses he loves her. Alisa tells him that she never slept with Sam, and that the baby definitely belongs to Trevor. Sam later arrives at the party and beats Trevor up with a baseball bat. Alisa runs into the house to get Mooney and Jay. In the ensuing fight Trife attacks Sam when he tries to hurt Alisa and beats him to the ground, but Alisa tells him to stop. As he is leaving Sam picks up the bat and hits Trife, who falls to the ground, critically injured. Katie's older brother arrives, carrying a gun and asking for Sam. He is about to execute Sam but stops momentarily and asks for a reason why he shouldn't kill him. Trife uses his last breaths to shout "because he isn't worth it". Lenny begins to walk away but Sam insults him so he turns and fires, but the gun explodes in his hand. He gets back in to his car and drives away. Trevor dies before the ambulance and police arrive.
