Prof. Krishnan  is a role model; honest and austere, he is a staunch follower of Swami Vivekananda. His principle in life is ‘Duty First’. He swears by his profession that shall serve his students to the best of his abilities and, to that end, will live as a bachelor. There is a feeling of admiration and great respect for him among his students. But love strikes his heart in the form of a student Radha . Even though he tries to resist her, he succumbs to her beauty and love. Prof. Krisnan’s orderly life is in shambles.
