Billy is a boy who has to decide what he will do with his life. His father works at the candy factory as a "fudge packer"  and "has several men under him". His mother is visited by a short, mannish woman who knows how to please the local housewives. His sister is preparing to be a good wife, and in almost every shot is moving a phallic object to her mouth.
