When Mickey reads something in a jokebook stating that one out of every four children born is Chinese, he begins to worry that his new baby brother or sister will be Chinese as well. The Gang put Mickey at ease by telling him that it will not be so bad to have a Chinese sibling. The gang then introduce Mickey to Spanky's friend Lee Wong. Once he has learned that people are people no matter what their ethnic background, Mickey is happyâ€”until he discovers that his much-anticipated "kid brother" is not only a girl, but twins to boot.
