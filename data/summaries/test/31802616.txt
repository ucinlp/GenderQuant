By the end of each summer, children from the Christian cult community in the suburbs of New Jersey visited Camp Hope. Deep in the woods, away from civilization, the children are taught the ways of cult-like Christianity, the dangers of lustful temptations and the horrors of the Devil. The charismatic priest, Fr. Phineas McAllister,  who teaches the children the doctrines of their faith has unknowingly brought evil with him by reaching deep into the children's minds, preying on their fears in an attempt to control the next generation. The priest fills these young minds with the belief that everywhere they turn an occasion of sin awaits them. He warns the young men about the demonic dangers of masturbation, because masturbation according to the priest opens the door to the imagination and gives the Devil access to the mind. The priest goes as far as to call a girl at the camp a whore simply because she was talking to a male member of the camp. As the priest homes in on Tommy Leary  and his provocative relationship with fellow camper Melissa , he learns Tommy has been experiencing demonic oppression since his grandfather's recent death. Tommy's ailment reminds him of another young man who Fr. Phineas failed and now can find some redemption by helping Tommy. However, Fr. Phineas repeats the mistakes of his past and drives Tommy further into madness as the demonic spirits that have plagued Tommy become more real and terrifying. Tommy is forced to face the Demon with his sanity and life hanging in the balance with no hope, only God's will.
