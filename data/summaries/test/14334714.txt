On a little island off the island of Honolulu in Hawaii, Granny, on vacation in Hawaii, has just put on a mumu dress, which Tweety finds extremely attractive. After Tweety does a hulu practice with Granny on his guitar, Granny tells him she's off to a luau she's just been invited to and tells Tweety to be good while she's gone. Before going, she remembers to feed Sharky  and gives him a bone. Soon after, Granny leaves and Tweety begins singing "Her name was Hula Lou" on his guitar. On the main island, Sylvester wanders around the beach looking for something to eat, but only finds fish skeletons and moans how he'll starve if he doesn't find any good food. Upon hearing Tweety's singing, Sylvester suspects his prayers have been answered and starts paddling to Granny's island in a rubber life raft. However, Tweety spots Sylvester approaching and orders Sharky to stop him. Sharky swims out and takes a bite of the life raft, only to inflate from it, but it's enough to scare Sylvester into rowing away. Sharky then lets go of the now deflated life raft, sending Sylvester flying and crashing into a palm tree, but the deflated raft keeps him from falling. Later, Sylvester takes a bow and arrow  and shoots the arrow to Granny's island where it catches on the palm tree there, creating a zip-line. Soon afterwards, as Sylvester rides the zip-line to the island, he thinks about what to have with a feast that involves broiled squab (soup de jour, chestnut salad, black-eyed peas . Just as Sylvester begins to come up with a dessert for the feast , he suddenly notices the zip-line is taking him down to the water, right into Sharky's doghouse. As Sylvester scrambles out of the water, Sharky leaps to take a bite, but misses. Sylvester manages to make his way to a palm tree on the main island, where Sharky comes up on land  and barks like a seal. Next, an air pump is seen on the beach of the main island and the camera goes underwater, showing Sylvester wearing an old fashioned diving suit and making his way to Granny's island underwater. Sylvester manages to make his way up to Sharky's doghouse , pets Sharky gently, and goes on, but Sharky wakes up after seeing Sylvester's tail and cuts the air hose. Just as Sylvester realizes his air supply has been cut off, he immediately scrambles back to the main island  and comes back onto the beach with his suit completely full of water. At that moment, the lower half of the suit splits off, enough for Sylvester to see that Sharky has got into the suit. Right after Sylvester leaps out, Sharky sticks out and walks back into the sea with the water logged diving suit. Later, Sylvester builds a pair of tall stilts, hoping that this time, he'll outsmart Sharky. However, just as Sylvester is making his way over to Granny's island above the water, he sees some fins in the water, of which the underwater camera reveals they belong to a school of saw fish, that seem interested in the stilts. As soon as the saw fish begin cutting through the stilts, Sylvester tries to retreat back to the main island, but gets lower until he's underwater before he finally gets back to the beach. Just as Sylvester is recovering from the backfired attempt, he hears a ship's whistle and see a ship heading back to California. Aboard the ship are Granny and Tweety, bidding farewell and "aloha" to Hawaii as their vacation is now complete. However, Sylvester is determined not to lose his expected lunch and begins pursuit in a canoe. "Oh, that bad ol' putty tat sure don't give up easy," compliments Tweety. At that moment, Sharky appears behind Sylvester's canoe, and, for his only speaking line, adds "Yeah! And I don't give up easy too." Sylvester then turns, gives a nervous look at Sharky, and awaits what Sharky has in store for him just as the cartoon irises out.
