The short is a virtual shot-for-shot remake of the teaser trailer for Juno, with the roles played by Star Wars characters. The film exploits the similarities between the characters of Padm√© Amidala  and Juno MacGuff , two young women who find themselves unexpectedly pregnant. Both characters choose to give their children up for adoption and struggle with complex relationships with the children's fathers -- Anakin Skywalker filling the role of Paulie Bleeker. The mock trailer also showcases parodies of two songs featured in the Juno trailer: "Anyone Else But You" by The Moldy Peaches is spoofed as "Part-Time Jedi / Full-Time Sith." And Mott the Hoople[[Mott the Hoople]]'s "All the Young Dudes" is transformed into "All Jedi Dudes."
