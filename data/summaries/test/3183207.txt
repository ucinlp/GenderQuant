Set in a private mental institution, it tells of a trainee occupational therapist Vincent Bruce  who becomes dangerously obsessed with a seductive, very able, schizophrenic patient Lilith Arthur . After engineering the suicide of another patient  out of jealousy for his crush on Lilith, Bruce presents himself for psychiatric help to his superiors. Chestnut Lodge would not permit filming on location so those scenes were done in a vacant mansion rented by the production company, Centur Productions, on the North Shore of Long Island . Location shooting in Maryland was done in a private home in Rockville as well as in the downtown area, plus scenes at Great Falls on both the Maryland and Virginia sides of the Potomac River, as well as a staged carnival scene at Barnssville, Maryland. This was Robert Rossen's last film before he died.
