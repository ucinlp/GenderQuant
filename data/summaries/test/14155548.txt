While speeding on the road, Donald Duck runs over a nail on a horseshoe causing it to pop his tire, necessitating its replacement with the car's spare. He encounters difficulty lifting the car with his jack, removing the damaged tire, and repairing it with a patch. Unfortunately for him, all four tires immediately pop once he resumes driving , but he continues his trip undaunted on four flats.
