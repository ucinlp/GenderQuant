{{Plot}} A baby reindeer named Rudolph is born with an abnormally red, shiny nose, and upon tripping into a pile of hay bales and sneezing shortly after his birth, his nose begins to glow. His parents start to worry that Rudolph will be made fun of because of this, and their worries come true when the secret of their son's nose is accidentally revealed to Rudolph's three uncles, Cupid, Dasher, and Comet , and he starts getting taunted for this. A year later, Rudolph is sent to school, where he falls in love with a gorgeous doe named Zoey but is ridiculed by everybody around him . When he can take being laughed at no longer, Rudolph runs from the school building and meets Santa Claus, who accepts him despite his nose and treats him with kindness. Shortly after, on Christmas Eve, after Santa has flown away for his annual travel around the world, Rudolph winds up running into Zoey, who wishes to befriend him. However, Arrow, Rudolph's cousin and rival who has also set his cap for Zoey, disrupts their romantic moment beneath the mistletoe to lead Zoey away, hating to see her with Rudolph, albeit she still holds a strong fondness for Rudolph. Years later, after Rudolph, Zoey, and Arrow have reached adolescence and are about to take part in the Reindeer Games, before the event, Zoey gives her pendant Rudolph to bring him good fortune, much to the chagrin of Arrow, who cheats at the games so he may be chosen to become a Flyer . During the beginning competition, Arrow argues with Rudolph that Zoey really does not truly like him, antagonizing Rudolph into making his nose gleam and blind Arrow. Rudolph wins the race, but is disqualified because he was tricked into cheating using his nose by Arrow, thus making him ineligible for the position of Flyer. The disqualification of Rudolph infuriates both Blitzen  and Zoey, who confronts Arrow for cheating and ends their romantic relationship. Rudolph also overhears Blitzen arguing with the coach of the Reindeer Games and catches him shouting at the coach that his son's nose was "an accident," which hurts Rudolph so that he decides to run away into the Arctic wilderness, longing for Zoey's company. Zoey is devastated upon learning that Rudolph ran away from home, so she decides to run off in search of him and even deliberately crosses the forbidden bridge of Stormella, the wicked Ice Queen, who incarcerates her in an icy prison cell. Meanwhile, Rudolph has become acquainted with an Arctic fox named Slyly and a polar bear named Leonard, but one night he winds up meeting the Sprites of the Northern Lights, a group of singing, colorfully-garbed sprites who fly around the North Pole and admire Rudolph, who tell him that he must rescue the kidnapped Zoey. They instruct him how to properly use his nose, and soon Rudolph, Leonard, and Slyly journey to Stormella's castle to free Zoey. Seeing as Zoey defied one of Stormella's orders by trespassing on her closed ice bridge, the antagonized Stormella fulfills her vow that she promised to perform if anybody ever crossed her bridge again: she unleashes a humongous blizzard upon the North Pole using her magical powers. Rudolph, Slyly, and Leonard make it to her castle, but soon find themselves locked up in ice prisons of their own for crossing Stormella's bridge. After the Ice Queen goes to sleep, Slyly sneaks into her bedroom to try and retrieve the key to his friends' prisons, managing to unlock them and free the group. However, the awakened Stormella learns about this and sends her pack of wolves after Rudolph and his friends, cornering them on a cliff. When she threatens to freeze Zoey, Rudolph is antagonized to such a degree that he uses his nose to blind Stormella, sending her toppling off of the cliff, hanging on for dear life. In spite of imprisoning his companions and causing him trouble, Rudolph saves Stormella's life by allowing her to grab on to his budding antlers and pulling her back up on the cliff, so she promises to reward him with a wish. Much to the Ice Queen's dismay, Rudolph wishes that Stormella would turn from evil to kindhearted, to which she reluctantly casts such a spell upon herself, but the snowstorm that she created is unstoppable. Boone and Doggle, two of Santa Claus's elves who were sent to search for Rudolph and Zoey, bring the entire group back to Santa's Village, though because of the blizzard Santa might not be able to carry out his flight this year. However, after he catches sight of Rudolph's glowing red nose, Santa asks the reindeer to lead his team of reindeer, to which he agrees. Rudolph guides Santa's sleigh through the storm, and it turns out to be a merry Christmas after all.
