Vincent Price plays Gallico the great, an inventor of stage-magic effects who aspires to become a star in his own right. Just before his first performance, his act is shut down by capricious manager Ormond , who wants Gallico's brilliant buzzsaw effect for the act of the Great Rinaldi ([[John Emery , an established star. With this defeat, and the humiliation of having already lost his wife Claire  to his rival, Gallico goes insane and uses the buzzsaw to decapitate his manager. His crime is almost revealed when Ormond's severed head is mistakenly taken for a trip with Gallico's assistant Karen ([[Mary Murphy  and her boyfriend Alan Bruce ([[Patrick O'Neal , a police officer. Gallico then impersonates Ormond to rent an apartment from Alice Prentiss , an author of mystery novels. Gallico disposes of Ormond's body, but is again forced to murder when his ex-wife Claire discovers the impersonation. Prentiss comes forth as a witness to the crime, but identifies Ormond as Claire's murderer. The Great Rinaldi again schemes to steal a trick of Gallico's, an illusion involving a crematorium, and ultimately winds up burned to death in the process. Gallico begins impersonating Rinaldi to take over that magician's show. Meanwhile, the detective Alan Bruce matches the fingerprints of Ormond with those of Rinaldiâ€”since both sets of prints are actually Gallico's, and the novelist Prentiss realizes her boarder, and the murderer, was Gallico and not Ormond. The two, along with the assistant Karen, band together for an ultimate confrontation with Gallico.
