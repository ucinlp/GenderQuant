Hearts in Dixie unfolds as a series of sketches of life among American blacks. It featured characters with dignity, who took action on their own, and who were not slaves.{{Citation needed}} The plot focuses on Grandfather Nappus , his daughter, Chloe , her young son, Chinaquapin , and her husband, Gummy . To make certain his grandson Chinaquapin does not end up like his father or become tainted by the superstitions that dominate the community, the grandfather decides to send the boy away. One particularly tender scene shows Nappus' love for his grandson, whom he sends North for schooling. The film ends with the youngster's departure aboard a riverboat.Langman, Larry.
