When news about the storming of the Bastille reaches the Court, most aristocrats and servants desert the Palace, fearing that the government is falling. They abandon the Royal Family. But Sidonie Laborde, a young servant who is the Queen's reader, has a crush on her and refuses to flee. She feels secure under the protection of the Royal Family. She does not know these are the last three days she will spend by the Queen's side.
