There is a mouse invading Porky Pig's house, but so far Porky's attempts to rid the mouse have failed. Porky gets a cat to catch the mouse, only for the cat to get bound and launched out of the house. Next Porky borrows a Mountain Lion, but the mouse has petrified and stuffed the lion. Next Porky hires a gangster cat, but he leaves straight after a bonk on the head with a bowling ball. Without any success so far, Porky constructs a robotic cat. The mouse retaliates at the robot cat, which flawless being unaffected by a bowling ball, a flamethrowing boiler, dynamite and a pistol shot. The robot cat then blocks the mouse's ways into the mouse holes. The robot cat further resists the mouse's tricks from electrocution, more flamethrowing, decapitation and battering. Finally the mouse blows up the robot cat with a dynamite laced clockwork mouse, destroying Porky's house. Despite this, Porky Pig is relieved to be rid of the mouse, who then emerges to say "Shall I tell him?".
