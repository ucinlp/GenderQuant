Daniel Shore, a 28-year-old German American, is about to spend a few days in the flat of his deceased grandmother. Since his return from Morocco, his mental state has become somewhat unstable. The trip to Morocco was all about getting away from the work-related troubles and his whole miserable life, but now there is even more to worry about, because in Morocco a boy got killed, and Daniel is thinking he might have become an accessory to the crime. Even in the new surrounding, Daniel is haunted by images of what has happened, until everyday situations push him over the edge and soon the past and present become an indistinct blur.
