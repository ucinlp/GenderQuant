Opening remarks by Charlton Heston and Mickey Rooney are used to establish the film’s direction and mood. Introductory scenes quickly dissolve into one laced with sounds of thunder and artillery fire. The setting is atop Niagara Falls where waters cascade over the falls’ edge. Superimposed in the haze are dissolving scenes of American conflicts from the American Revolutionary War through Desert Storm. At the misty base of the falls, a glass-like figure materializes from the fog and walks toward the camera. As it draws closer, it assumes the features and flesh tones of George Washington who states, “In my years of public service for this nation, I have observed one truth...that no people can be bound to acknowledge the Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of men, more than the people of the United States. Every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency.”  Washington’s figure morphs into that of Benjamin Franklin who declares, “Everywhere I turn today, I see dissent. I see, Sir, those who say this great American experiment cannot work. They fail in their understanding, to realize that their very right to say that, was paid for with human life. Yet, for their own marginal good and safety, they are freely willing to forsake the heritage of this nation. To those I say.... They, that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.” Franklin turns from the camera, transposing into President John Adams who proclaims, “Posterity—you will never know how much it has cost my generation to preserve your freedom. I hope you will make good use of it.... If you do not, I shall repent it in Heaven, that I ever took half the pains to preserve it.” Adams fades as the Niagara setting dissolves to a stage scene with Charlton Heston addressing the audience, “That proclamation, addressing posterity, was spoken by John Adams, the second President of the United States. Adams was one of the original signers of the Declaration of Independence. He served for eight years under George Washington as this nation's first Vice-President. His words still ring through the halls of time. They call to those of us here today...to carry on the tradition of freedom, for which so many have died. We are that posterity... and, we have been summoned.”  Heston's scene transitions to that of the giant arch in Washington Square at the Disney-MGM Studios. A lowering camera reveals vocalist Larnelle Harris, singing, Let Freedom Ring. As the song concludes, fifty doves released on each side of the arch fly toward the camera. One dove trails the others in a similar arc but flies closer to the camera spreading its wings and passing over the lens. As it does so, it transitions to title for the picture and its opening credits. The duration of the picture provides a continuing narrative of America’s founding and evolution from the revolutionary days of 1776 through the 20th century. By means of prosthetic make-up technology and historical locations, famous leaders from the past are used to speak to the present.  Film and television personalities, guests and vocalists support the production with commentary and music. The music varies from Petra founder, Greg X. Volz, to Babbie Mason, Andrae Crouch and Lee Greenwood. Both music and commentary are interspersed with the re-creations of famous Americans in history.  Successive scenes build upon the other, moving from the nation’s founding to the problems of a 20th century contemporary society. One dramatic episode originates with Senators John McCain and Bob Kerrey discussing military sacrifices throughout the nation’s history. Their settings transition to President Abraham Lincoln on location in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania delivering his Gettysburg Address. As Lincoln speaks, the background dissolves into evolving war scenes progressing through each of America's major conflicts. The segment ends with Lincoln’s closing lines over the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier as the surroundings dissolve into an early American street with The Imperials singing the "Battle Hymn of the Republic". Closing scenes contain commentaries from presidents ; each expressing how they view America's greatness. President George H. W. Bush speaks last and with his closing words, the setting dissolves to one with actor, singer and businessman, Gene Autry. Autry addresses the viewing audience explaining what America has meant to him. At the close, he recites the Pledge of Allegiance after which his scene transitions to one with President Ronald Reagan articulating farewell remarks to the audience. Reagan's set dissolves into a gigantic American flag that in turn transitions to Liberty Square at the Walt Disney World Resort. Sandi Patty and a sizable choir sing "The Star-Spangled Banner" as a large American flag rises behind them. At the song’s close, a wide shot of the singer, choir and pavilion reveal a massive display of overhead fireworks. The scene dissolves to the final credits underscored by a new version of America the Beautiful by Gene Autry .{{cite web}}
