In 2020 New York, eccentric Ken Castle  has revolutionized the gaming industry with his invention of self-replicating nanites that replace existing brain cells and allow full control of all motor functions by a third party. The first major application of this technology is a game called Society, which allows gamers to control a real person in a pseudo community . This generally boils down to the players engaging in all manner of debauchery, such as deliberately injuring their "characters", engaging in sex with random people, and eating disgusting things because they don't actually have to taste it. As a result, those who work as "characters" in Society are very well paid for their participation. With Castle's huge success and earning money as the game's creator , he created a second game, Slayers, which is a multiplayer, third-person shooter game with death-row prisoners as avatars in genuinely lethal battles on specially created battlefields . Any death-row inmate who survives 30 matches gets his freedom, while minor offenders only 1 match. There is also a lag problem; as there is no comunication between the inmates and players , there is problem with the timing of the player's moves and inmates actions. In the Slayers, John "Kable" Tillman  is the most recognizable face and the best soldier in Slayers due to having survived by now 27 matches, far more than any other participant in Slayers{{'}} history , marking him as one of the harder targets, and he is also the crowd's favourite. Simon , a seventeen-year old gamer and popular rock-star, controls him. While Castle, now fabulously wealthy from the success of the two games, is interviewed on a talk show with the popular TV host named Gina Parker Smith , an activist organization called the "Humanz" hijacks the broadcast and claims that Castle will eventually use the nanite technology to control people against their will. After a stranger gives Tillman a warning in his prison cell that the game's mastermind plans to kill him, Tillman asks Simon to relinquish control over him in the 30th match. He uses this opportunity to escape and successfully drives out of the deathmatch arena while news outlets report that he has been officially listed as fragged, which saves Tillman but brings Simon in a difficult postion; he loses all of his reputation, humiliated as a "cheater", his bank accounts are frozen, and he is under investigation from the police with charge of helping Tillman escape the gaming site. Meanwhile, Tillman is taken to the Humanz leader named Brother , who explains that the mind control technology can potentially be used without discretion on anyone, leading to the "extinction of independent thought". Tillman seeks out his wife Angie , who has been working as an avatar for a particularly heinous Society player. After a violent confrontation with security he manages to enter the Society world to escape with her. He returns to the Humanz base where the rebels deactivate the nanite cells in Angie's brain. Tillman reveals to the Humanz leader that he was part of the original experiment to launch nanites in the brain. The first person to successfully be implanted with nanites was Tillman's close friend Scotch . In an interrogation with Scotch, Tillman, controlled by Castle via nanites himself, killed Scotch, thus putting Tillman on death row. Upon hearing of the game Slayers, he signed in so he can be set free. Upon learning that Castle himself has adopted his young daughter, Tillman infiltrates his mansion. Castle leads him to a room with a large basketball court and, after a song-and-dance number using mind-controlled Slayer warriors as backup dancers, reveals that, as the nanites in the other brains are designed so that they could be controlled by the others, his nanites are designed so he could control the others. To demonstrate, Castle beats Tillman savagely while restricting him from fighting back. Angie and their daughter are brought out after Castle reveals that most of the Humanz have been found and killed. Castle then allows Tillman to crawl to his family and attempts to force him to kill his own daughter, though Tillman resists. The last two members of the Humanz  broadcast this confrontation on all TV channels and all New York's signs and cameras, exposing Castle in front of the crowd, and then give Simon control of Tillman. He interferes with Castle's control and allows Tillman to move towards him. The interference and Tillman's prompting that Castle think about stabbing himself allows Tillman to shove the knife into Castle's chest. After Castle dies, Tillman convinces Castle's technicians to release them from the nanite control, as they have been "played" for too long. The technician that does so, simply walks away, after saying "Well played, Kable". The film closes with a shot of the Tillmans road-tripping, much like Kable's first flashback about his family.
