In the "cartoon dimension" mad scientist Doctor Carnage experiments on a man, then disembowels him and rips his skull out through his stomach. On Earth, sisters Cindy and Candy are left alone with Cindy's friend Amy when the girls' parents go to a wedding. While Cindy and Amy call over Rick and Eddie, Candy watches a Terror Toons DVD she received in the mail up in her room. Created by Satan, the DVD depicts the antics of Doctor Carnage and his accomplice Max Assassin, a stolen lab monkey mutated into a monster by Carnage. As Cindy and her friends play Strip Ouija, Candy dozes off, being woken up when Carnage and Max appear in her room. The two rip Candy's spine out, behead her friend Tommy when he drops by, dismember a pizza delivery man with a giant pizza cutter, and do a hypnotic disco dance number that causes Eddie to vomit up his own innards. When Cindy, Amy and Rick try to escape, they find all the doors have been replaced with vertigo-inducing spirals. Rick is taken and has his brain experimented on by Carnage and Max, and Cindy and Amy are separated when a police officer released from Terror Toons is blown up by a stick of dynamite hidden in a box of donuts. Cindy is captured by Carnage, and along with the lobotomized Rick, is forced to watch as Carnage and Max saw Amy in half as apart of a magic act. The two villains then take Cindy to a cartoon version of Hell and present her to the Devil, who explains he intends on using Terror Toons to ravage the Earth and corrupt children. Realizing that "anything goes" in cartoons, Cindy becomes a superhero and challenges the Devil, who sends her back to her house. Upon discovering a machine producing Terror Toons DVDs, Cindy is attacked by Max, but she uses her new powers to snap his neck, and stomp his brains out. When Carnage comes at her with a giant axe, Cindy uses it against him, cutting his head in half with it. As tiny monsters pour out of Carnage's split skull, Cindy destroys the Terror Toons DVD press with a crowbar. Sometime later, the parents return, and find Rick banging his head against a wall while Cindy laughs hysterically, surrounded by the remains of her friends and sister. Next door, a boy finds another copy of Terror Toons in his mailbox, and rushes inside with it. The boy's front door slams shut, and Carnage's giggle is heard.
