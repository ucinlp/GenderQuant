The plot revolves round the family of Shama Pradhan, a rural farmer, and his two sons, Baraju  and Chakadi , and disagreements over the family home and land after his death. On his death, Shama Pradhan entrusts his elder son Baraju with the responsibility of looking after his younger son Chakadi, and entreats him to keep the family land and home together, and not split it between the two brothers. Baraju is a peace-loving person who commands respect from the villagers for his idealistic way of life, and Baraju's wife Harabou  is portrayed as an ideal housewife, who is very caring and affectionate towards Chakadi, his wife Netramani  and their two children. Chakadi, in contrast, is shown as carefree and irresponsible, happy to loaf around the village. His wife, Netramani, who is envious of Harabou, insists that the property should be split between the two brothers. A local troublemaker, Hari Mishra , also tries to sow discord between the two brothers. Swayed by the designs of his wife Netramani, and of troublemaker Hari Mishra, Chakadi asks his elder brother to divide the property between them. Baraju is shocked, and is torn between his respect for his father's wishes and his affection for his brother. His solution is to hand over the land and the house to Chakadi, satisfying Chakadi's desire, while respecting his promise to his father not to partition the property. Baraju leaves the house with his wife Harabou and their two children, without regret or rancour. After Baraju's departure, Chakadi feels miserable, is nostalgic about the old times, and wants his brother and family back. He goes to Baraju and begs him to return home. But Baraju, who is committed to the spirit of sacrifice, non-attachment, and love, advises Chakadi to go back home and take care of all that he has left behind.http://www.orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2008/November-2008/engpdf/65-72.pdf
