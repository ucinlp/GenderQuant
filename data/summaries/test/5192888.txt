Against the wishes of his law partners, lawyer Andrew Morton  takes the case of Nick Romano , a troubled young man from the slums, partly because he himself came from the same slums, and partly because he feels guilty for botching the criminal trial of Nick's father years earlier . Nick is on trial for viciously killing a policeman point-blank and faces execution if convicted . Morton's strategy in the courtroom is to argue that slums breed criminals and that the community is partly to blame for crimes committed by the people who are forced to live in such miserable conditions. Through flashbacks, Morton demonstrates that Romano is more a victim of society than a natural-born killer. Yet, Morton's strategy does not have the desired result on the jury thanks to the badgering of District Attorney Kernan . Morton, however, does manage to arouse sympathy for the plight of those trapped by birth and circumstance in a dead-end existence.
