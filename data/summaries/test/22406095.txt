A murder case has occurred and the police are unable to find loopholes in the alibi of the main suspect, Ms Yasuko Hanaoka, thus creating obstacles in the investigation. Detective Kaoru Utsumi again sought the help of professor Manabu Yukawa who, seeing the case has nothing to do with physics, initially refuses to help. However, after a happy reunion with his genius classmate, Tetsuya Ishigami, for whom he has high admiration and who is also the neighbor of the main suspect, he senses that Ishigami is in love with Hanaoka and decides to investigate the case on his own. He succeeds in cracking the case only to reveal a sad and shocking truth that will do no good to all parties save the police. Despite having a reputation of being emotionless when solving cases, this time Yukawa is much affected by the outcome.
