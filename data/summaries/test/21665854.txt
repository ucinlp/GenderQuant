In Ancient Egypt, there once reigned the malevolent Queen Aneh-Tet , who ruled Egypt with an iron fist, terrorising the populace and slaughtering her enemies. Upon her death, her body was cursed, and buried in a secret location. In the modern day, an archaeological team uncovers Aneh-Tet's sarcophagus, and accidentally unleashes her evil onto the world. Among the team of experts opposing Aneh-Tet is Molly , a young woman who finds herself pitted against Aneh-Tet's evil in the final battle against the forces of darkness.
