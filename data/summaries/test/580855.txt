The film opens with a montage of animals and Mufasa's voices, some clips left over from the previous attraction, Symbiosis, playing the song Circle of Life. Simba, now king of the Pride Lands after he defeated his uncle Scar and his army the Hyenas and save his home the pridelands, sees Timon and Pumbaa clogging up rivers. He asks what they are planning and Timon replies to him that they are building a non-ecological resort called Hakuna Matata Lakeside Village. Simba tries to tell them that other creatures nearby need water as well, but Timon and Pumbaa still don't care. Simba decides to then get his point straight to them by telling them about another creature  who is like them. He explains to them how they needed space, power, and food for themselves. They also decide to help nature by studying animals and ending pollution to save the environment. Timon and Pumbaa then decide to take out the dam and give the water back deciding that they've learned their lesson. The film ends with a shorter montage and the screen fades to black.
