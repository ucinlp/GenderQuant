Showing tonight at a theatre is "Four Daughters with Selected Shorts". Throughout the performance, members of the audience do some miscellaneous gags and Egghead keeps interrupting by singing She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain and getting dragged offstage. After a brief orchestra, comes talented pianist Maestro Palawitski, but he inserts a nickel in the piano to play for him. For that, the performance judge rejects him. Next up is a divo penguin, but he too is rejected. Next Hindumystic Swamiriver has his sword through the basket act with Egghead as the volunteer, but Egghead doesn't emerge after the act. Next is the ballerina flea, Teeny-Tiny-Teensy-Tinny-Tinny-Tin reciting a high-pitched version of "Mary Had a Little Lamb" but she as well is rejected. For the next act, Fleabag McFoodle gives instructions to his highly-trained dog. Then there is a Hamlet acting fox who is shunned by a member of the audience and rejected. Next is the balcony scene of Romeo and Juliet played by a hen and a rooster. Finally comes the final judging for the performers, but to the announcer's surprise it is Egghead himself who picked by the audience, which is now composed of many Eggheads.
