Alfred Polly  is a day-dreamer with his nose in books rather than keeping his mind on his work. Following his dismissal from a draper's shop, where his father had placed him as an apprentice, he finds it hard to find another position. When a telegram arrives informing him of his father's death, he returns to the family home. With a bequest of Â£500, Polly starts to think about what he should now do with his life, and a friend of his father's, Mr Johnsen , urges him to invest it in a shop - an idea that Polly hates. Whilst dawdling in the country on a newly-bought bicycle, Polly meets, and has a brief dalliance with, a schoolgirl, Christabel . It can't last, and eventually he marries a cousin, Miriam Larkins , whom he met at his father's wake. It is not a marriage of love, but one of convenience. 15 years pass and Polly and his wife are running a drapers in Fishbourne. Polly hates the shop and the marriage has descended to incessant arguments and bickering. Whilst walking in the country to get away from his wife, Polly decides to commit suicide but also sets his shop ablaze in the hope the insurance will set Miriam straight. He botches the arson job and instead of killing himself, rescues an elderly neighbour and becomes a minor local celebrity. Still unhappy, Polly decides to simply leave Miriam; he walks out and finds his way into the country where he comes across an inn on a riverside. The innkeeper  is seeking a handyman and ferryman. Polly takes the job, but soon realises that the position was open because the innkeeper's brother-in-law is a drunkard who chases any other man away from the inn. Polly ends up having a few run-ins with Uncle Jim , who finally accidentally trips and drowns in a weir when he is chasing Polly. Polly returns to work in the inn. Several years later, he wonders whether Miriam is getting by. He returns to Fishbourne to find that she has opened a tea-shop with her sister, in the belief that Polly had drowned . He runs into his ex-wife whilst exiting the tea-shop; she thinks she recognises him and shrinks away in fear, but Polly quietly leaves and returns to his happier life at the inn.
