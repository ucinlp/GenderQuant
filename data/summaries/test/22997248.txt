Durairaj  is a lorry driver who is tough as a nail. He had a bitter childhood and has no relatives or friends and his only solace is Jayaram  his cleaner who is just the opposite of him. Jayaram is a happy-go-lucky guy who dots on his mother , wife Mallika  and daughter and dreams of making enough money to build a small house for his family. Durai and Jayaram share a special bond, as they understand each other well. On his way to see his family Jayaram dies in an accident and Dorai goes to his village with the body. There he finds that Jayaramâ€™s family needs his help and out of sympathy he decides to settle there and build a small house according to the last wish of his friend. There he comes across a local landlord  who cheats the illiterate villagers by giving them loans and later taking over their property. Then there is a teashop owner Vasantha  on whom the entire men folk lust. But she is hard working, and at the same time foul mouthed and is a terror. Dorairaj works hard to make a house for Mallika and when the villagers suspect his good intentions, he proves to them that he has a sisterly affection towards her, as he has a soft corner for Vasantha. How Dorai wins over the villagers and fight against injustice against the landlord and his son forms the rest of the story.
