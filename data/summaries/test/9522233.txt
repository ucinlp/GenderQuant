Harish Venkatraman , a software architect by profession who lives in Malaysia, is the millionaire nephew of Maheswaran Iyer . Having lost his parents early in life, he runs the business of his uncle with impressive results. He stumbles upon the psychiatry student Deva , in the most cinematic manner, and as script would have it, falls for her that very instant. Deva is the daughter of Commissioner Arumugam  and Dhamayanthi  in Chennai. As the plot progresses, Deva is being summoned by her parents for their silver jubilee wedding anniversary back home. Notwithstanding the fact that he has a flourishing business to attend to and much to the wrath of his uncle - who arranges for his wedding with his business partner’s daughter - Harish takes the next flight to Chennai to accompany Deva. He is subjected to a warm welcome by Radhika and cold shoulder by Arumugam. To make matters worse, Harish's uncle's  vicious character assassination – in the name of a complaint he sends to the Police Commissioner’s office – doesn’t help Harish in the task of gaining enough confidence among his girlfriend’s parents. Will Harish ever win his love back, now that his chance of impressing Deva’s parents are doomed, forms the rest of the story.
