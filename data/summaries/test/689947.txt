Down-and-out keyboardist Chance  sees redemption in touring with dub-pop band Future Pigeon, fronted by the lovely Rocket . But to make the band, he needs a signature sound&mdash;which he finds in the futuristic '69 "Molotron" keyboard. Chance's dreams are put on hold on the eve of the tour, when the Molotron is swiped from his car. Southlander follows Chance and his friend Ross Angeles  as they track down the stolen keyboard through the pages of the Southlander, a local rag that publishes classified ads for musical equipment. The journey quickly turns into a surreal trip through LA's underground music scene. Southlander runs approximately 80 minutes, and is filled with musical interludes, performances, and an original soundtrack.
