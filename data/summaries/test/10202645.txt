Set in the 1900s, the film follows the exploits of the likable but raffish Boon Hoggenbeck , who takes an interest in a new car, a Winton Flyer that is the property of a man named Boss , the patriarch of the McCaslin family, who live in the Mississippi area where Boon lives. When the taking of the car first by Boon and then by Ned   leads to a public brawl, the local magistrate lets them off by a bond that Boss pays on the condition both men stay out of trouble and further away from the car while he is away with family to tend to a funeral. That is soon changed by Boon, who takes the car again to go down to Memphis to see his woman Corrie  and talks his young friend Lucius  into going for the ride. Ned stows away as well, but Boon grudgingly allows him to come. Other characters include a horse that loves sardines and races for them, the opulent Corrie and a man with a horse who lives near an impassable sinkhole full of mud for which he charges expensive rates to get both carts and cars through.
