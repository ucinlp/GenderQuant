It has been many years since a group of humans retreated to an artificial colony below the planet surface. The colorful world that used to exist was ruined by pollution and possible war, making it uninhabitable. Much of recorded history before the move has been forgotten, despite the numerous advances in technology. The last remaining information lies in a vast archive of data, much of it in corrupted formats. Determined to recover this precious information, the "Archive Excavation Department" works specifically to restore as much of it as possible. Long ago, the Department used to be excited and full of energy. Now, people know that knowledge of the lost past can bring only sadness. Ura, a particularly motivated member of the department, works long hours to recover history. Riko has lost her passion and desire to know. Then one day, Ura comes upon a record that once decoded, completely changes the way he sees his world.
