Norman Pitkin  works at Scotland Yard as a car cleaner but dreams of becoming a policeman like his late father. The police reject his request to join the force but recruit him to work undercover in disguise as the double of a suspected jewel thief, an Italian crime boss who looks just like him. In addition to his criminal activities this man is a ladies' hairdresser. Norman disguises himself as the suspect and gains entry to his salon. Once inside, after some mishaps, he manages to find the stolen goods, knock out the suspect, wrap him up in a curtain/wall rug, and bring him to justice. As a reward, he is offered a permanent place in the police and marries his love, the ex-girlfriend of the man he brought to justice .
