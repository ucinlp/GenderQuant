Howard  is the meanest nastiest thug in town, a Harley riding criminal with a hot wife Loretta . Loretta's problem is she's having an affair with Lance , owner of the town diner and Howardâ€™s getting suspicious. Driving back from one of their nightly flings, Lance witnesses the local family of weirdos, the Stackpools, dragging a man from his truck and into their house. Seeing this as an opportunity, Lance discovers the Stackpools terrible secret. They are quintuplets but instead of being born as a normal human, they each have one of the traits of one human being. One is super strong, one has super senses, and one is super attractive . The whole family is run by the one with super intelligence, the 'head of the family' from the title, Myron . Little more than a giant head with hands in a wheelchair, Myron psychically controls his other siblings, but seeks more. When idiotic locals fall for his trap, he experiments on their brains, trying to find a normal body to house his superior intellect. Lance blackmails the Stackpools with their secret, getting them to kill Howard and demanding $2,000 a week in cash.  Eventually Myron tires of Lance's bottom feeding, and captures him and Loretta, to get them to destroy the evidence of their secret. To force Lance's hand, he puts Loretta in a mock play of Joan of Arc in the basement, complete with a burning at the stake. The dumb strong one, seeing the 'pretty girl' in trouble, carries her off before she can be hurt, and burns the house down. With the Stackpools and Lance dead, the ever scheming Loretta realizes that the big dumb one is the heir to the family riches. She marries him inheriting all the Stackpool fortunes, but the ending suggests that Myron is still alive and is controlling the dumb one again....
