...a man hesitates between two women... The main character is played by Barbet Schroeder, but was dubbed by Bertrand Tavernier, whose voice Rohmer judged more appropriate for the very literary voice-over. The structure of the film is about a man who sees and falls in love with a woman he passes by in the street, but he doesn't know how to talk to her. When he finally speaks to her, she disappears and he begins a daily search for her in the area that he has seen her in. During his search, he begins a habit of stopping in a bakery to buy a snack. Over time, the "girl" in the bakery becomes interested in him and he starts flirting with her, and, eventually, convinces her to go on a date with him. Before the date begins, however, he runs into the woman that he was originally searching for and is forced to choose.
