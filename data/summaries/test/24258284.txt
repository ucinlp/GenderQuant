Purushottam  embezzles money from a firm of brokers owned by Padmanabham in order to get his son Mohan Rao married to Hemalatha, daughter of the millionaire Visalakshamma . The now impoverished Padmanabham partially gets his own revenge when his daughter Sushila  becomes a film star Vishwa Mohini. The film producer Pashupati, brother of Visalakshamma, introduces her. The star Viswa Mohini falls in love with Mohan Rao and her father agrees to their marriage provided Mohan can find a job. He pretends to have done so and the two get married. Hemalatha offers money to Viswa Mohini to go away and free Mohan, which, in an emotional scene, she refuses to do.
