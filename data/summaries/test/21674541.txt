The film stars Rémy Girard and Pauline Lapointe as Léo and Ginette Lespérance, a married couple who, after facing one too many Montreal winters, move their family to Fort Lauderdale, where they buy a motel catering to "snowbirds". However, their new business runs afoul of "Big Daddy" , an established motel operator and local crime boss, who makes it his mission to drive the Lespérances out of business. The Lespérances may, however, have an ally in Jay Lamori , a local businessman of uncertain motives who may or may not be what he seems.
