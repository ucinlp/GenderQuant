The first story, told by Morrison, is about an Indian tribe's revenge against the man  who desecrates their burial ground. When that tale fails to impress Deeds, the second story, also by Morrison, tells about a man  who helps a seductive seemingly pregnant woman  in trouble. Deeds then responds with the only non-supernatural story of the three, about a homesteader family whose father  is forced to participate in a lynch mob. Finally, Morrison tells about a gunslinger  haunted by a man he kills. The next morning, Deeds points out to Morrison that the body he's carrying doesn't match the description on the wanted poster; Morrison cuts the body loose and rides out.
