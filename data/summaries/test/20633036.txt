The Pink Panther sets camp for the night leaving a serving dish containing a cake for breakfast. During the night, he sleepwalks and eats the cake in his sleep. The next morning he finds the cake missing and thinks a thief pinched it, so he gets out a Sherlock Holmes-styled hat and a magnifying glass and tries to track down the thief, scaring a tree on his way. A thief dressed in black drives in a car, leaving tire tracks behind. Before entering a house, he reduces his car into a snake. The pink panther follows the trail to the house. The door keeps moving sideways before the panther can turn the handle, so he charges and pushes the door down. The door opens as a trapdoor leading the panther into the cellar. The panther sees the thief and gives chase up a really long flight of stairs. Then the thief and panther go upside down on the stairs. Not long after that, the thief cuts off a segment of the stairs and the panther tries to get the thief climbing a ladder. The thief and panther plunge into a tub of water along with the ladder . The pink panther finds the thief in bed, but as he lifts the covers its just a pair of legs. The panther chases the legs into a dark room. Every time he turns on a light, the thief splatters a cake in his face. At the end of the darkness, the pink panther finds himself with the thief in a giant fish bowl. When the panther surfaces out into a tub of water, the duck lays an egg on his head. The panther breaks open the egg, releasing the thief. As the panther walks on, a spotlight appears and homes in on him. The spotlight then becomes a balloon trapping the panther. The panther punctures the balloon with a claw, making an explosion of daisies. The panther wakes up to find himself in his camp and the cake is still there. The panther hides his cake in a trash can and goes back to sleep. The thief however holds the cake, whistles the panther awake and splatters the cake in his face.
