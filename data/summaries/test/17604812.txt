An aging, but capable and talented session guitarist named McQueen  is awakened by a late-night call from a nearby recording studio. He is needed to help smooth out some tracks that are being worked on by an established and popular hard rock band, the Raging Kings. The band’s own lead guitarist, Dean Storm  is resentful of McQueen’s involvement, and after an argument with the other members he decides to leave the group altogether. Impressed by McQueen’s skills, the band asks him on the spot to replace Storm and he graciously accepts, fulfilling his lifelong dream. After a brief jam session, Storm suddenly returns to the studio and asks to speak privately with the original band. They soon return from the meeting, and one member comes to McQueen and reluctantly tells him that he’s out. Stunned, McQueen manages to complete what he was called to do and returns home to his wife, who is still in bed. She asks what the call was about, to which McQueen replies “Just another session.” The film ends with McQueen staring into the darkness, trying to come to terms with how he realized his dream and lost it in the same night.
