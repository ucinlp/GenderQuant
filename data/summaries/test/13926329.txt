Doctor Helen Hunt  meets millionaire playboy Peter Kirk  in an unusual wayâ€”he crashes practically at her feet at a ski resort. He insists that only she can treat his  injuries and soon proposes marriage, which she accepts. On their wedding night, Helen is called away by a medical emergency. When she returns, Peter has fallen asleep. Peter becomes jealous and gets into confrontations with two of her patients, Robert Andrews ([[Gordon Jones  and Frederick Vandemer . He is chagrined to learn that Vandemer had also staged a skiing accident to get to know Helen and that Vandemer asked her to marry him. Helen recruits Billings , Peter's groundskeeper, to try unsuccessfully to interest the idle Peter in gardening. After another, very embarrassing altercation with Vandermer, Peter gets a job as a tie salesman under the alias of "John Jenkins" to try to please his wife. Peter finds that he likes working and becomes ambitious. Helen is delighted and decides to retire and become a housewife. However, the other department store employees recognize him and resent him for taking a job away from somebody who actually needs it, resulting in his firing. Billings gives Peter an idea with the suggestion that he create jobs with his money. Peter decides to buy a nearly-bankrupt hospital, which will require most of his income to keep running, and make Helen the chief of staff.
