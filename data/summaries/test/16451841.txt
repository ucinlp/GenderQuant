Joe  is a has-been actor who seemed to have had great success at one time but who now just spends his time drinking, doing drugs and sleeping with random women. The only person he has in his life is his personal assistant Ophelia, and even she is getting tired of him. He receives a call from his mother to say his childhood best friend, Boots, whom he has not seen in years, has died. He attends a disastrous meeting with his agent, who has lost interest in Joe and his career. Joe then meets with an up-and-coming director, during which his excessive drinking causes him to lose the part he had hoped would restore his flagging career. His agent tells him that he is washed up, no one wants to work with him, and quits. This upsets Joe, then Joe goes to a sea and stares at the waves, which reminds him his teenage life. The film flashes back 25 years to a 16-year-old Joe  and his best friend Boots . We find out Boots has epilepsy and has recently had an attack in the cinema. Joeâ€™s next-door neighbour, a bored housewife named Evelyn , comes on to him and invites him over that evening, where they are almost caught in sexual activity by her unsuspecting husband. The next day Joe meets up with a popular but quirky girl his own age from town, Ruth . She invites him back to her house which he accepts, leaving Boots alone and angry, after seeing Ruth's home, Joe is delighted. Ruth applies make up to Joe's face, making him resembling a star. Both of them dance and indicate their interest in each other. Next day Evelyn watches Joe in the bathroom seducing him to come to her home on way to his date, Evelyn coaxes Joe to stop with her and they end up having sex. Joe arrives late to meet Ruth, who has been kept company by Boots. Ruth sees love bites from Evelyn on his neck and storms off. Boots questions Joe if he had sex with Evelyn, which Joe declines calmly. Boots questions him again, this time more loudly making Joe angry. In his frustration, Joe has a fight with Boots. The next day, Evelyn comes on to Joe again, asking him about his date. Joe replies saying it was terrible due to love bites visible on his neck. She responds saying she really liked how he touched her, then inviting him to her house, if he again wants to repeat it. This time Joe is more excited than Evelyn. She proceeds to force her little girl, Jane , who was watching TV, out to play so they can have the house to themselves. While Joe and Evelyn are in bed, Jane finds a washed up mine, climbs on it and detonates it, perishing instantly. Joe blames himself, runs away on the day of the little girl's funeral, and doesn't return. Joe left as a boy but returns as a middle aged man. We are now in the present. Joe returns to England to attend Boots' funeral, but is too late and has missed it. His mother and Aunt tell him that Boots died of an aneurysm and left behind his wife Ruth, four young children, and a lot of debt. Joe goes to visit Ruth at the graveyard who tells him how much she loved Boots and what a wonderful person he was, but how she cannot cry even though it is the saddest moment of her life. His sister tells him that Evelyn also died a few years ago. Evelyn's marriage had broken up after Jane died and she married a cruel fellow we were shown briefly at a fishing scene in Act 2, who beat her. When Evelyn finally found the courage to leave the guy, she was struck and killed by a truck. Her head was never found at the crash site: officials suggested it was taken by a fox. Joe goes back home to the grand house he purchased for his family when his career was going well. He listens to the same music he and Ruth listened to the night they danced, and decides to write her a cheque to help her out. He encloses with the cheque a letter which had a special phrase written in it from a song they shared the night they met. When Joe's sister gives it to her, Ruth breaks down crying instantly. Chastised by all that has occurred, Joe heads back to Los Angeles and is met by his personal assistant with whom he starts talking about his possibilities as an actor in the future.
