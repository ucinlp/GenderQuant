Cristian Quintanilla  and his sister July {{cite web}} have a web-show of "paranormal investigations" covering urban legends. When they are invited to spend the Easter holidays at the family's summer home, they intend to investigate the story of Melinda, a girl that went missing in 1940 and supposedly haunts the woods. The investigation turns dangerous when the family dog is found in a nearby well, presumably killed by Melinda or her ghost. Five days later, the police find the bodies of the Quintanilla family and recover the video footage shot by Cristian and July. Throughout the film, Cristian and July spend a great deal of time wandering around the hedge maze near the summer home. Their father reveal that their mother once knew the maze quite well in her youth. The two teenagers refuse to let their 8-year old brother José join them in their video escapades. Upon finding a well in the hedge maze, Cristian leans into it and calls Melinda's name. July chastises him for being disrespectful. The morning after the dog, Robin, goes missing, Cristian and July look for him, eventually finding him, dead, at the bottom of the well in the maze. They do not tell José or their mother. That night, their mother enters their room, screaming José's name, claiming that he has gone missing. The mother and the two children leave the house and head to the hedge maze to search for José. They are inevitably separated. Eventually, Cristian finds July, tied to the pillars of a small gazebo, bleeding profusely. He leads her back to the house, where they find José's burnt body in the fireplace. They then hear noises outside and July hides in a kitchen cupboard, while Cristian goes to the front door. An axe blade bursts through the door, and Cristian runs upstairs to hide in the bedroom. The next morning, Cristian goes downstairs to find the kitchen cupboard empty and drenched in blood. July is missing. Cristian goes into the basement, where he sees a videotape playing on an old VCR. It is a tape of his mother, in a mental institution, being interviewed by her doctors and asked about a woman named Elvira. As Cristian watches this tape, his mother comes up behind him and slaughters him with an axe.
