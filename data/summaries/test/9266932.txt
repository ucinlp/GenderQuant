Two months after the exchange of nuclear weapons on earth the spacecraft's guidance system is mysteriously reprogrammed, forcing the crew's return to earth. In order to survive, the crew must escape to the radiation free zones while avoiding cannibal 'terminals' and a military school student turned evil despotic ruler. The spacecraft lands, considerably off-course, on a beach in eastern Canada. Jordan  is knocked unconscious on impact. Walker  exits first and is quickly killed by 'terminals' - humans crazed by disease. Several hours later, in the middle of the night, Howe  ventures out in search of help and a way to escape. He soon encounters Vinny , a survivalist who has fortified his house with barbed wire and booby traps. Vinny effectively saves him from the terminals and makes him his prisoner. As the plot develops, Vinny, JJ  , and Howe are captured and taken in chains to a makeshift fortress built out of junk. They must escape before a malfunctioning nuclear warhead explodes in sixty hours.
