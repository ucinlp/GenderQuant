Two boys are born on the same day. One is Rahul Mehta , born with a silver spoon in his mouth to a rich family in England; another is Sameer , born in a middle-class Brahmin family somewhere in Mumbai. Both grow up until they are destined to exchange places on their 22nd birthday. Rahul Mehta's parents died when he was young, and he lives with his grandfather Shambunath Mehta . He wants to visit India to see his parents' graves though his grandfather doesen't want him to go. He is afraid Rahul may fall in love and ruin himself like his parents did. With much persuasion, he comes to India and manages to escape his guardians, Ram Singh  and detective Mirchandani , at the airport and catches a taxi. The driver of the taxi is none other than Sameer who, not knowing Rahul's true identity, keeps cursing the rich guy for being born on the same day him and enjoying the wealthy life. Later, Rahul discloses his identity and Sameer feels ashamed, but both become good friends. Rahul does not want to go back to his wealth-ridden world, so he asks Sameer to take his place and let him take Sameer's place. So Rahul becomes the taxi driver and informs Ram Singh that someone will be coming to them in his place. Sameer reaches the hotel, and Ram Singh has a tough time grooming Sameer to behave like a rich guy. Rahul goes to Sameer's place where he finds Sameer's sister Paro  and falls in love with her.
