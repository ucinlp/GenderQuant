A person goes missing on Los Angeles, California's Venice Beach The Los Angeles Police Department are called to the scene and after an investigation, believe it was merely a typical drowning case. As the police have more important things to do, they forget and quickly move on. Soon, the police get several more calls of missing people from Venice Beach. The puzzled police officers come down to the beach once again, and the police initially believe it is the work of a serial killer. Meanwhile, more and more people and a dog go missing. The police realize the thing on the beach is no serial killer when a teenager lets her friends bury her in the sand, but they unbury her only to find she has shredded legs, and a rapist is gorily castrated before the eyes of his horrified victim. Eventually the LAPD realize that people are being sucked under the sand by something under the ground when a woman is seen being sucked completely under the beach in a few seconds when she goes to retrieve her hat late one night. The local news and media quickly and widely cover the scenes at the beach, leading the police to try to figure out how to kill the beast as quickly and easily as possible. The police manage to use a backhoe and equipment to dig under the sand and track the monster down. After a struggle, they manage to blow it to pieces with a massive charge of explosives. But just as people begin crowding the beach again, new sinkholes begin to appear in the beach sands.
