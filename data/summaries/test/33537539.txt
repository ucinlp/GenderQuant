Three college students drive to the Bluff, an Atlanta neighborhood, intending to buy some drugs from a dealer. One of the students holds a camera with the hope of filming the encounter. They find a dealer named Curtis Snow, who asks them to drive him to his house in order to fulfill their order. Once they arrive, Curtis pulls out a gun, robs them of their purses and camera, and makes a hasty escape. Recognizing the quality of the camera, he hands it to one of his friends, telling him to continue filming in order to capture their day-to-day life in the “hood”. Curtis soon learns that another group of people have encroached on his territory, selling drugs not far from his street. He recruits his friends and robs the rivals of their drug supply. When a friend tips him off to another gang selling drugs nearby, he invades their house with the help of his friend and robs them of their supply as well. While playing at a pool hall, Curtis recognizes one of the rival gang members by his familiar white hat, who likewise takes note of Curtis. The man in the white hat follows Curtis into his territory, asking the locals about him, but the surface threat doesn't faze Curtis and he continues to hustle. On his way back home after cutting the latest stolen product with his crew, Curtis is ambushed in a backyard alleyway by the rival gang members. Luckily the bullet wounds are not fatal and the ambusher's gun jams, allowing Curtis to flee. He collapses in the street nearby, where he is found by a police patrol and subsequently arrested in connection with a prior robbery. After his release from jail, Curtis is anxious to get right back into the drug dealing game. He attempts to get revenge by ambushing the rival gang, but in retaliation, they target his girlfriend and mother of his child. Her death causes Curtis to sink into depression, as he now has to take care of his young son while continuing to deal drugs. Soon after, however, Curtis meets a friend to discuss up-to-date information on a mark. En route to shakedown this dealer, the car that they're in is once again ambushed by rival gang members. Curtis and his crew return fire then give chase only to be intercepted by cops, causing everyone to bail on foot. Returning home after losing the police, Curtis is enraged by the turn of events and ransacks a room, then quietly watches his son play in the debris. The movie ends with Curtis calling a local video editing studio and asking them if they can edit together all the footage he has collected.
