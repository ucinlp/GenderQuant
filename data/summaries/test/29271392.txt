A womanising playboy becomes tired of his philandering lifestyle and asks his current girlfriend to marry him. At the wedding reception, his best man makes a speech treating the entire gathering to the finer details of the bridegroom's chequered romantic history. The bride becomes upset, and her new husband is furious with his best friend for being so indiscreet. He whisks her straight out of the wedding hall and they set off on honeymoon. Matters are set for a series of farcical complications and misunderstandings as they start to meet a motley selection of odd characters who do nothing to improve relations between the newly-weds. Then the best friend's wife turns up at the honeymoon location, announcing that she has left her husband in disgust. He is quickly on the scene trying to change her mind, and soon there are two sets of bickering couples going full steam, while the bridgroom and his best friend also clash with each other. The bewildered bride has to try to make up her mind whether or not to stay with her new husband.
