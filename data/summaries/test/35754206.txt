Peter "Tex" Coleman, a butter and egg man from Texas, comes to New York with his mother's life savings to buy a hotel in the big city and be near his stage struck sweetheart, Lydia Weston. Upon his arrival, Tex finds Lydia working as a secretary for a couple of fast-talking producers rather than being the stage star that her home town thinks she has become. Tex is just the angel for whom sharpshooter producers Mac McClure and Marty Allen have been waiting, because they have a play set for rehearsal but no money to produce it, and their leading lady, Valerie Blayne, is adding to their problems by threatening reprisals from her gangster boyfriend, Pooch Davis, unless the show opens on schedule. Tex agrees to invest his money in the show if Lydia is given the lead, and when Mac and Marty consent to his terms, the play goes into rehearsal as a drama with two leading ladies. When Valerie threatens Mac with bodily harm unless she plays the lead, Mac informs Tex that he is going to fire Lydia unless he buys the entire show. Sensing that the play would work as a farce, Marty's wife Marge puts up the money on the condition that Tex play the male lead. True to Marge's instincts, on opening night, the play has the audience rolling in the aisles as dynamite planted on stage by Valerie's vindictive boyfriend explodes, and the actors' performances are so bad that they are funny. As a comedy, the show becomes a smash success, but when a plagiarism suit looms on the horizon, Tex and Marge sell the show back to its eager producers and leave them holding the bag.
