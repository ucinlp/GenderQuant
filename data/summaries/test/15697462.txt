Katt Williams decides that he wants to make it big in Hollywood, and meet with a pair of producers who attempt to woo him with pitches for movies featuring stereotypical plot devices used by other notable African-American comedians, such as using a "fat suit" and portraying multiple characters, or starring in parodies of other popular movies. Dissatisfied with the offer, Katt decides to hit the road with a group of friends, which included comedians Red Grant, Melanie Comarcho, and Luenell. The first half of the movie features stand-up by Katt's friends as they drive from one major city to another. The journey ends in Chicago, where Katt Williams takes over the rest of the movie with his open, underground-style stand-up comedy. After his performance, Katt ends the movie with a musical performance by himself, Da Brat & Snoop Dogg while the bloopers show during the end credits.'Katt Williams: American Hustle   - Full Cast and Crew' IMDB.com February, 2008.
