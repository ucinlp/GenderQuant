At Fort King, Florida, in 1835, Lt. Lance Caldwell is charged with the murder of a sentry. At his court martial, he recounts the story of the fragile peace between the settlers and the native Seminole Indians and how that peace is threatened by the strict fort commander, Maj. Harlan Degan who wants to wipe out the natives. Caldwell’s childhood sweetheart, Revere Muldoon, meets with Osceola, a Seminole chief and old friend of Lt. Caldwell’s. Through respect for Caldwell, Osceola comes to the fort under a flag of truce, but is imprisoned by Maj. Degan. Osceola dies whilst in captivity and Caldwell is accused of his murder and jailed. Eventually the truth comes out and the Seminole Indians rescue Caldwell from his prison.
