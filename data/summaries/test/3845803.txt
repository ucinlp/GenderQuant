King Goobot and Ooblar from the movie Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius return to Retroville and they say they come in peace. Everybody at first is upset to see them but when the Yolkians begin to give them everything they want  they begin to trust them and make peace. However, Jimmy knows that they are up to something evil to destroy Retroville . When he tries to tell people that they are lying, the citizens won't believe him. So he puts a recording of the Yolkians through his lie detector and he finds out it is, in fact, a big lie, only to gain the townspeople's loyalty and turn them against Jimmy. He runs to tell his Mom and Dad and then he figures out that they have gone to the Retroville park for an announcement. And what he finds there is a giant egg that looks exactly like the one that the Yolkians' "chicken" god, Poultra, hatched out of in the original film. To Jimmy, this confirms his worst fears, but the citizens of Retroville are too turned by the Yolkians to listen to him. To Jimmy's surprise, the large egg does not contain a mutant carnivore chicken, but a shower of invitations to a party hosted by the Yolkians. This gets Jimmy rejected for being rude to the Yolkians. Later, Goobot sneaks into Jimmy's lab and steals his generator to re-create Poultra from Poultra's toenail, the last piece of her that contains her DNA. At the night of the party, Poultra is resurrected and Jimmy tries to warn everyone, but is still rejected. Suddenly, Cindy who in the film has been envious of Jimmy's genius knowledge and was bribed by the Yolkians into telling them how to get into Jimmy's lab making the excuse that she'll be a new genius. After realizing she has been tricked, she stands up for Jimmy, reminding the townsfolk of everything he's done for them. The townsfolk grow more receptive, just as Poultra arrives. With all the help Jimmy can get, he saves the night using the fact that "chickens can't burp". The citizens, who are alerted of Poultra's arrival, but unable to escape the party, help Jimmy into luring Poultra to drink a large tank of soda and eat a dummy made of what is essentially Pop Rocks. When Poultra consumes the entire tank and eats the dummy, she cannot release the excess gas created by the soda and candy, and explodes due to the buildup of pressure. The end of the movie reveals that all the Yolkians  take off from the earth in a large container mounted on a rocket . Everybody is forced to apologize to Jimmy in the language of English, French, and Chinese . Then there is a celebration.
