Steve Mallory has been involved in a car crash, and it appears he has killed his mistress, Holly Mitchell. Steve suffers from amnesia, he has no recollection whatever of the event. His wife is hostile and cold toward him, his father-in-law has been severely disabled by a stoke and his wife's cousin appears to hate his guts. Added to this is the sinister presence of Lester Aldrich, who turns out to be the downtrodden husband of the sleazy Holly.
