Shaukat  is a Booker Prize-winning writer, whose latest work has been criticised by one and all for being too surreal for anyone's liking. Antara , his wife, supports him nevertheless. Shaukat has some weird plans for his next book though. He decides to manufacture a realistic story by making Antara hide her marital status from Yash  and pursue a relationship with him. Things go wrong as Antara begins to have real feelings for Yash.  Whatever Shaukat pens turns out to be true. He starts to believe he can change Antara's and Yash's fate by his writings, and writes according to his logic that Yash would commit suicide after getting to know Antara's reality. However, Antara soon comes to know of this. She lies to Shaukat that Yash really committed suicide in order to disillusion Shaukat. Shaukat, out of guilt, becomes schizophrenic. The film ends on a disturbing note: Antara sends Shaukat to an asylum, due to his schizophrenia.
