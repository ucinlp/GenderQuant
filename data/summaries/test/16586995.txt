My Apocalypse is the surrealistic story of Stewart Savage , who is actually the notorious serial killer known as the North City Stalker. Stewart still lives with his parents, Jack  and Linda , in an overcrowded future world where the polar ice caps have melted and the military controls all aspects of everyday life. The Savages only have their apartment for half a day. At 6 p.m., they must turn it over to Nathan Eastman , his wife Victoria , and their son Victor . Stewart, however, sees everything as idyllic and in bright colors; his family is wholesome and happy and his girlfriend adores him. In reality, he is very much insane; he hates his meaningless job, strangles his girlfriends, and prefers the psychotic solace of the world inside his head. He has just murdered his latest girlfriend, Susan Stone . Completely unaware of the difference between fantasy and the state of things as they actually exist, he is convinced that his fianc√©e is still alive and brings her home to meet his parents at his father's birthday party. Aware of their son's activities, the helpless Savages are full of good cheer and play along with his sick delusions at the party, while actually frightened and angry. While acting as though it is mainly embarrassing, Stewart's annoyed parents attempt to bag the fresh victim before the Eastmans arrive. Though his parents have become complacent with his psychosis, the people who share the apartment are less sympathetic. Stewart becomes more unhinged when they show up. Descending further into madness, he pulls a gun and starts waving it around as he holds his family and the Eastmans hostage. More horrific than being held at gunpoint by a serial killer are the truths that surface when they are forced to speak candidly to one another.
