Tourists have departed the national park where Humphrey lives, leaving trash everywhere. The lazy park ranger gets the resident bears to "put it in the bag", by singing and dancing to a lively song. The bears happily collect the trash, bouncing and jouncing until they discover the ranger's trick. Angrily they dump their bags of refuse on the ground. The ranger prepares some chicken cacciatore, but will not give it to the bears unless they clean up their sections of the park. All of the bears move their garbage into Humphrey's section. In order to get his dinner, Humphrey has to make it fast by stuffing the garbage into a bag, but it gets caught by a bush and rips apart, letting the garbage out. Then he receives a new bag and follows the garbage down the line all the way to the cliff, but falls off. Next, he attempts to conceal the garbage under a bush, but a rabbit pushes it out in disgust. Next, he tries to burn it with a match, only to be stopped by Smokey Bear!  Finally, Humphrey puts all of the trash into a hollow stump, which is actually a geyser named "Ol' Fateful". The ranger prepares to reward Humphrey with a whole dish full of cacciatore but before Humphrey can take it, the geyser suddenly erupts, spouting garbage everywhere, resulting in Humphrey having to start all over at cleaning up the park.
