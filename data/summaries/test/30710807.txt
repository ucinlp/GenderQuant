Ritesh Virani , Niranjan 'Nanj' Nayar  and Puja Nigam  pass with bad percentage in their exams,Ritiesh is an avid planner and Manager,who promises his father,who works in a salvage shop,that he will one day go from Ritiesh Virani to Mukesh Ambani.Nanj is an avid fitness freak,but cannot bring himself to explain it to his Tamil Brahmin father.Puja constantly threatens and bullies her father with suicide whenever he brings up the subject of her marriage.The trio's friend Vishnuis a top student who's afraid of his strict and overbearing father Mr.Vardhan.Mr.Vardhan scolds his son for even getting 1% less.After being unable to find an admission,they ask their parents to persuade Mr.Vardhan to recommend seats for them,but Mr.Vardhan humiliates them publicly,saying that "If the parents were a little more responsible,their children wouldn't be this useless"and then proceeds to praise his own son.Seeing their parents' upset and humiliated faces,they use Vishnu's help to create their own fake college. They also use help from Google Chand , a very close relative of Ritesh, as well as a genius. After the college is set, they name it "Fakirchand And Lakirchand Trust University ". They hire Bajirao , a small nursery teacher as the principal.Their plan goes awry when some random and useless children from around the country show up for their admission at F.A.L.T.U.The trio are then forced to continue the act.The first three days pass with the students partying hard.When Ritiesh goes to his home,his father shows him a simple philosophy about his salvage yard,"these things you see around you are treated like junk by the world,but we have repaired them so that they can be used again",that makes him realize that partying is not the only way of life.Ritiesh and Bajirao try to make the students study by calling them as their parents. The students try to study the books that they are handed,but they can't understand them,leading them to burn them in a partying spree.Bajirao and Google are angered at the loss of fine education and the students' attitude and leaves.Ritiesh,Puja and Nanj try to convince Bajirao to stay,saying that they'll accept any punishment.Bajirao makes them sit in a graveyard,saying that their parents,while thinking of their children's future,were scared like they are now.He makes them write their hobbies and their passions.F.A.L.T.U thus becomes a multi talent university,using lecture videos from different professionals.Ritiesh even designs a website using these videos so that people can learn their passions and hobies from this website.Mr.Vardhan,growing suspicious of his son,finds out about F.A.L.T.U,and proceeds to shut it down,but Google obtains a stay order from the court.The news about F.A.L.T.U goes on the news and the papers,and the students are disowned by their parents.But Ritiesh's father supports his son,saying that not many people come up with an idea to start a college and educate people.Many come in support of F.A.L.T.U. Therefore the students take part in a talent competition for universities, where after their performance, they are humiliated by Vishnu's father . Then, one of the show judges, Mr. Subodh  enters, he stops Vishnu's father, and asks what they have to say.Ritiesh then gives a speech that 35% is Pass,yet they give jobs and admissions to people above 70%.The majority of students between 35-70% are the F.A.L.T.Us and that it is derived from the country's own education system".Mr.Subodh then tells them that he has a 4 year old granddaughter who always asks him why we must study.He hasn't been able to give a satisfactory answer but they have given the answer to that question.he then approves F.A.L.T.U as a real and important college for the next 3 years, as he sees true education in their fate, and hope. In the end, Bajirao does what he is best at;a principal with principles.Everyone respects him for that and he is trying to adjust with it.Nanj fulfills his dream, becomes a fitness-trainer. Puja becomes a DJ. Vishnu frees from his dad's jungle, and decides to become an actor. Google Chand is still relaxing in his pad, still living life while he can. And Ritesh now owns F.A.L.T.U, which is now full of 2000 students.
