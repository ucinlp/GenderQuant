{{Plot}} The film is a frame story in which an unkempt girl, Willie Starr , tells the story of her dead sister Alva to Tom, a boy whom she meets on the railroad tracks in the middle of the school day. Willie is wearing Alva's clothes and jewelry, and she and Tom sit on the railroad track while Willie tells Alva's story, which the viewer sees in flashback. Willie's story opens as Owen Legate arrives to the small town of Dodson and comes upon the Starr Boarding House. A loud party is in progress, and the only person not somehow engaged in the revelry is Willie. Owen befriends Willie, although he is reluctant to answer whether he works for the railroad. Willie introduces Owen to her mother, who rents a room to Owen and explains that the party is for her birthday. The introductory scene makes it clear that Alva is the "main attraction." In the house, Mama gives change to an older man, Mr. Johnson, who has paid for the beer she is holding in her hand . Mr. Johnson is anxiously waiting for Alva to show up to the party, and Mama is apologizing for Alva's absence. Meanwhile, Alva has been making out with another man, Sydney, behind the house. Owen watches the transaction between Mama and Mr. Johnson as well as a car full of other men who have driven by the house, yelling, "We want Alva! We want Alva!" Willie becomes angry with Lindsey Tate, the ringleader of these men, and threatens to call her Mama. Lindsey replies, "You do that. And tell your Mama if Alva ain't here, we'll take her instead." When Alva finally arrives at the party, many men greet her and try to get her attention and dance with her. Even Mama's boyfriend, J.J.  is after Alva, and he kisses her in the dark. Then the birthday cake is brought in, but when it is time to blow out the candles, Mama grows upset about her age and is unable make a wish. Alva is enlisted to blow out the candles for her and make a wish, much to the delight of the men at the party. It seems fitting since the party was more for Alva than for Mama. Willie takes Owen into the kitchen for some food as the party is breaking up, and Alva makes a pretense of needing some ice to cool herself off in order to go into the kitchen to meet the stranger. There she launches into a fanciful story about Sydney taking her dancing at the Peabody Hotel in Memphis. Willie is entranced, but Owen is skeptical since the story seems to be told in multiple choice format. Alva is angered by this, and returns to Sydney. She then launches into a new fantasy about riding the train, the Hummingbird Express, to New Orleans, where Owen has just stated he is from. This is the first of many statements by Alva alluding to Mardi Gras, and generally to getting out of Dodson some way. Owen sees Sydney kiss Alva from his room, and she sees him watching and goes inside. Both Willie and Alva seem to be curious and a little unnerved that there is a man staying in Papa's room, which has been empty since their father left them. On her way up the stairs Alva pretends she is looking for Willie in order to make an excuse to go into Owen's room. Sheepishly, Alva admits she's never been to the Peabody, but asserts that feeling like she was there is just as good as being there. Owen disagrees, and says, "You know there was a cat once who fell asleep in the sun, and he dreamt that he was a man who fell asleep in the sun who dreamt he was a cat. And when he woke up, he didn't know whether he was a man or a cat." Alva shrugs this off, and begins to talk herself up. Owen propositions her as though she were "included with the room." Alva angrily leaves and goes to her room to cry. Mama enters the girls' room and tells Alva that she has to go out on a date with Mr. Johnson the next night because Mama "wouldn't like it if he got dissatisfied and moved out right now. Nobody but a conductor can afford to pay what he does for that big old north room." It is clear that Mama deliberately uses Alva to attract men to the boarding house. Alva again escapes into a reverie about getting away from Dodson, and attending a masked ball at Mardi Gras. She also mentions the above-ground graves in New Orleans, saying that the worst part about being buried underground would be not being able to breathe. This is the first reference to Alva's lung problems, which are also a symbol for the suffocation she feels in the small town and under her mother's control. The next day Willie, who is skipping Vacation Bible School, sees Owen on his way to work. Owen confronts Lindsey Tate, who is again harassing Willie about Alva. Owen shoves strawberry ice cream into Tate's face and heads off to work. Owen does work for the railroad, and he has come to town to lay off several railroad employees due to cutbacks made necessary by the depression. The next evening, Mr. Johnson is waiting for Alva to get ready for their date, but she is avoiding it. Mr. Johnson buys Alva an expensive gold bracelet, and Alva explains that Mr. Johnson should be giving such gifts to his wife. He tells her that his wife is an invalid who stays in a nursing home just outside Baton Rouge. She makes an excuse to get Mr. Johnson to go inside, then leads Owen into the garden to show him her father's red-headed scarecrow. In the garden Alva says her father just left the family "to find greener pastures." Alva believes her father will come back, but it's obvious that she is hoping in vain. Owen confronts Alva about her arrangement with her Mama, which Alva doesn't want to face and won't admit to. He makes her angry, insinuating that she is a prostitute  In her anger, she runs back to Mr. Johnson, tells him she will accept the bracelet after all, and invites everyone in the house to go skinny-dipping. Mr. Johnson won't go, but Mama, J.J. and the other guests do join Alva. In the water, J.J. manages to get Alva alone and comes on to her. When she refuses him, J.J. tells Alva that Owen is a "spotter" who has come to lay off most of the town. Alva doesn't believe him, but she runs to Owen's room dripping wet anyway to confront him about it. The two end up spending the night together, and when they wake up most of the boarders have received their pink slips from the railroad company. Since most of the town is out of work, Mama has arranged for the family to accompany Mr. Johnson to Memphis, where he will take care of them. It's understood that he will be seeing a lot of Alva in Memphis. Meanwhile, Owen buys Alva a ticket to go with him to New Orleans. As he is on his way into the house to give Alva the good news, he overhears Mama telling her friend about the Memphis arrangement with Mr. Johnson. Knowing that Owen spent the night with Alva, Mama plays up the fact that Alva is "just wild to go" to Memphis. Owen is hurt and yells at Alva about it, above Alva's pleas not to listen to Mama. Owen leaves for New Orleans, and Alva is left alone with Mama and Mr. Johnson. Mama, J.J., Alva, and Mr. Johnson go out to "celebrate" their new arrangement, and in her hurt and anger, Alva gets drunk. She begins to openly confront J.J. about his constant pursuit of her, and gets him to admit in front of Mama that he'd rather be with Alva than with Mama. Alva marries J.J. that night out of spite, but steals his money and their marriage license the next morning and runs away to New Orleans while J.J. is still asleep. Finally free of Dodson and Mama, Alva tours New Orleans. The film contains several scenes of New Orleans landmarks including Bourbon Street, Jackson Square, and Lake Pontchartrain. Alva eventually finds Owen in New Orleans, and they are happy together. She misses her sister, Willie, however, and sends Willie a postcard inviting her to join Owen and Alva in New Orleans. One day Alva and Owen come home to find Mama in the house. Alva is terrified because she hasn't told Owen about her marriage to J.J. Mama takes control of the situation and tells Alva to get her coat, but Owen stands up to her. Mama reveals to Owen that Alva married J.J., which Owen doesn't believe until he sees the look on Alva's face. Alva runs out into the rain, crying. The film cuts back to Willie and Tom on the railroad tracks, and Willie explains that Alva died of "lung affection"  which had been alluded to earlier in the film.
