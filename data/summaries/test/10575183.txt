Blood Diner is a dark comedy/horror about two brothers, Michael Tutman  and George Tutman  becoming brainwashed by their serial killer uncle Anwar Namtut , into completing his task of resurrecting the Lumerian goddess Sheetar . To do this, the brothers must collect different body parts from many immoral women, stitch them together, and then call forth the goddess at a "blood buffet" with a virgin to sacrifice ready for her to eat. Meanwhile, two mismatched detectives work together to track them down before more carnage can ensue. For some reason, a man named Horatio Titus  is a health food expert and is actually a 400 pound redneck. He promptly throws up in the diner.
