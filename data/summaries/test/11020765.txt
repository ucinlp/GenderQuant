Pirate Yosemite Sam spots another ship and demands its surrender. All of the crewmen abandon ship after they exclaim in horror of "Pirate Sam", leaving only Bugs Bunny, a stowaway in a box full of carrots, who finds "Pirate Sam" does not sound very intimidating. Bugs then looks at the other ship. Sam said to surrender. Bugs refuses to give up  and a battle ensues . Eventually, Sam gives one more warning when Bugs throws a lit match into the powder room. Sam rushes to get it and puts it out. He mentioned that if Bugs throws another match in to the room he is not going after it. To which Bugs throws another lit match down there. Sam stood there not going down just as he promised, but he decide to do it, much too late. Then the whole ship blows up and Sam lands on Bugs' ship. With his ship destroyed, Sam grabs the matchbox and does the same thing that Bugs did to him. Sam demand he go and get the match but Bugs refuse to get it. Panicking, Sam swims back to shore. But he didn't realize that it was the women's powder room. And to which Bugs said "talcum powder doesn't blow up". Which then there was an explosion and we see Bugs flying up with the pieces of the ship saying "Well I could be wrong you know", as the cartoon closes.
