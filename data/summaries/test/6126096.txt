Dr. Archibald is not home very much, and Andrew feels he does not care about him. And Lea  his wife does not want Jennie, and says she makes trouble. But the children take an instant liking to her. Jennie is unique in that she is learning to use and understand sign language. Jennie becomes an important part of Archibald family and Dr. Archibald's son, Andrew  develops a close relationship with her. Jennie loves the things Andrew does, such as baseball and comic books. Jennie is also there for Andrew when he and his father disagree. A doctor Pamela Prentiss  starts training with Jennie. She does not agree with the way Jennie is being cared for, and is seen as being rude to the Archibald family. She teaches Jennie sign language in a way that Jennie does not understand, but Lea finds a way she understands. Dr. Prentiss tried to convince Hugo to admit Jennie in the science lab where she works, but Hugo declines. But when Jennie starts making trouble, such as taking all the mail from the mailman, and eating the neighbors tulips, she is taken to court and admitted into a science lab.
