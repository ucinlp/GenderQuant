{{Plot}} The four friends: Cloe , Yasmin , Sasha , and Jade , are about to start high school. Head girl Meredith Baxter Dimly  wants everyone to belong to a clique, and goes about organizing people. She does not like the independent spirit of the four girls and plots to destroy their friendship and make them conform to her pre-fabricated cliques. Cloe is an ace soccer player. She meets Cameron  and is instantly smitten. Sasha is recruited as a cheerleader. Jade joins the nerdy kids and meets Dexter  and designs great outfits. Yasmin joins the journalist kids. Yasmin meets Dylan , who is deaf but can lip read. The friends begin to drift apart, as they are compelled to stay within their cliques. Two years later, the girls no longer speak to each other. Meredith is organizing a talent show and she engineers it every year so that she can win. Yasmin begins to know Dylan better. Cloe and Cameron like each other, but Meredith likes Cameron as well, and goes out of her way to sabotage their relationship. She sends her dog to mess with Cloe and Cameron. The dog trips Cloe and sends her food flying at Jade. Soon, Sasha and Yasmin get involved, resulting in a food fight, and the four girls end up in detention. Much to Meredith's distaste, however, the girls repair their damaged relationship and vow to stay together. Meredith prepares for a second "Sweet Sixteen Party", though no one can come unless they are willing to sit with the clique assigned to them by Meredith. Yasmin, Cloe, Jade, and Sasha, unwilling to break their friendship again, refuse to go. But when Cloe's mother becomes sick and can't make the food for the party, Cloe and her friends take over the job. They are humiliated when their server costumes turn out to be clown suits, but Jade and Sasha turn the outfits into amazing clothes that make everyone at the party take notice. A huge stage has been set up at the party, where Meredith sings. She embarrasses Yasmin but her downfall begins when Yasmin and her friends refuse to serve her. She falls off the back of an elephant she rented for the party, crashes into her birthday cake, and finally plunges into the pool. Humiliated, Meredith calls the girls "brats". They decide to take the name as their heading, and are known thereafter as BRATZ. The girls deal with their own problems: Sasha copes with her separated parents and wants them to try again; Cloe and her mother are struggling to make ends meet. Jade is keeping a part of her identity hidden from her parents; this applies in particular to her overprotective mother. The reason for Yasmin's shy nature is that she only lives with her grandmother and it is unknown what had happened to her parents.Soon the girls make up after saying sorry. The film ends on a happy note when the girls perform together at the talent show, overpowering Meredith. Meredith wins the trophy, and the girls win the scholarship, which they give to Cloe. The girls are also invited to a red carpet premiere, where they sing while Meredith watches them with binoculars in the distance with her father.
