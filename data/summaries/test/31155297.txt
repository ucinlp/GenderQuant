The story revolves mostly around Producer-cum-Director B.R.Pantulu, who plays the role of School Master and his wife. Uncommon about Balkrishna is that he plays a positive role in the film. Bustling actor Narasimharaju is also there. Film has some sentimental and emotional moments and laughable moments too. It has some classroom incidents. Film also has some village politics at the start, which continues to influence the school master character throughout the film. The Film teaches life lessons.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250714/reviews-1
