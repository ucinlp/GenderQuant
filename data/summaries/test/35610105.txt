In June of 1939, King George VI and his wife, the Queen Consort Elizabeth  made a visit to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's country estate in Hyde Park, New York. At the same time, the President was growing closer to his distant cousin and eventual mistress, Margaret Suckley. No British monarch had ever visited the U.S. before, and Roosevelt hoped to bolster American support for the United Kingdom on the eve of World War II, which broke out less than three months later.
