Unable to bear the teasing of his colleagues, hunchbacked musician Peter Wallace leaves for the country. He falls in love with and marries blind girl Helen Raymond, who has a beautiful voice. They have a baby and Helen regains her sight at the north of her child. Once she realises Peter is a hunchback she goes temporarily insane and leaves him, abandoning her daughter at old Matha's with a violin, and taking refuge at a convent. When Helen gets better she leaves the convent and becomes an opera singer. The daughter is raised as "just Peggy" and grows into a beautiful young woman, and talented musician. She is educated at the expense of Frank Leighton, an impresario. Peter is brought in to conduct and orchestra while Helen is singing; she seems him and faints but when she wakes up the two of them are reunited and try to find Peggy. Peggy winds up performing as a violinist with her old violin; Peter recognises it and she is reunited with her mother and father. Peggy then marries Frank.{{cite news}}{{cite news}}
