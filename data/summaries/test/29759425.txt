After World War II, when her best friend dies, an Englishwoman, Ann Richards as Amy Atkins / Tillie Gray, takes two orphaned children in search of their Father, Franchot Tone as Johnny Gray, in the States. A former U.S., G.I., he turns out to be a successful architect, who claims he doesn’t remember them, or their Mother. The question is whether he’ll lose his position, if he remembers, with his boss, Clarence Kolb as Mr. Evans , and his fiancé, Frances Rafferty as Lois Evans, the boss’s daughter; or, more, if he can’t remember.
