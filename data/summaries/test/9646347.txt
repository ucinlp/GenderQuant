 The film tells of Maria , a political activist in an Argentine organization that is fighting the oppressive military dictatorship during the Dirty War. She also teaches reading and writing in the suburbs of Buenos Aires in a blighted area. She too lives in a decrepit rooming house with her mother Diane , who rents out some rooms. One of the lodgers is a young man named Felix , who's in love with Maria, and rather shy. Felix seems to have come from nowhere and is supposed to work as a watchman in a garage. One morning, Maria is kidnapped by a military squad in civilian clothes in front of her mother and is taken to the garage Olimpo, one of the many well-known torture places in the middle of Buenos Aires, which operate to the general indifference of the local citizens. As soon as Maria is captured the film's mood becomes uncomfortable and the atmosphere is minimalist. Tigre, who's the head of the center ([[Enrique Pi√±eyro , appoints Felix, their best torturer, to make Maria talk. Yet, Felix is overcome by his feelings for Maria, and Maria is determined to exploit the situation with Felix for her survival.
