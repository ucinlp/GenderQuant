Basically, the film is just the episodes "Mind Your Manners" and "Queen For a Day" shown back to back.  Strawberry Shortcake's friend, Raspberry Torte, shows absolutely no regards towards manners. So Strawberry and Company decides to teach her a lesson by first inviting her to a party where everyone shows disregard for manners, and another where everyone is polite and courteous. Raspberry still fails to see the significance of manners, however, until she holds a conversation with a bluebird who talks some sense into her. Finally, she understands how important good manners are.  Strawberry and Company are preparing for the Berry Blossom Festival. However, the Pie-Man and Sour Grapes comes around, and by cheating, they manage to wrestle the crown from Strawberry, and intend to use it to take over Strawberry's fields. However, through a song, the other characters managed to win the crown back for Strawberry. In progress, Strawberry is named Strawberryland queen.
