During the War of 1812, Captain James Marshall has to run the blockade enforced by the British in order to collect a war loan obtained from France. His first mate is Ben Waldridge, who is a former Royal Navy captain cashiered by the navy. Waldridge brings his former gun crew along and as soon as they realize that there's gold coming on board, they plot mutiny. Leslie, Waldridge's gold-loving former sweetheart, arrives at the same time.
