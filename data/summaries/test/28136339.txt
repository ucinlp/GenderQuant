Bimbo prepares to rob a train that he has forced to stop. He then sings "The Holdup Rag." A ferocious bearded cowboy emerges, eats the barrel of Bimbo's gun, and, pulling off his beard and costume, reveals himself to in fact be his wife Dangerous Nan McGrew, whom he had abandoned. She then throws Bimbo into the locomotive, disconnects it from the rest of the train, and they drive off.
