 The film is about Kyabla , who lives in the slums, and falls for rich girl Bobby . Bobby loves Prem  and hates Kyabla. But Kyabla, who is obsessed with Uttam Kumar's films, won’t give up easily. The film is a funny take on the love triangle. The title Ekbar Bolo Uttam Kumar was a dialogue director Chinmoy Roy told in his starring film Basanta Bilap; it was an instant hit. "Besides, this is my way of paying tribute to Uttam Kumar,” said the actor-turned-director.
