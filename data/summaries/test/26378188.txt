The film is an account of a college girl's frustrations with the predominantly male patriarchal system in Egypt. Released in 1959, the film captures much of the feminist sentiments of the 1960s and its widespread fervor in Egypt. The film's protagonist, Aminia, played by Lubna Abdel Aziz, is a young woman living with her aunt's family which includes her uncle and her cousin. The men in her life further reinforce the themes of male dominance in the film with their restriction on her life.
