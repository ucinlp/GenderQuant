At the estate of King Herman the 6â…ž , the deposed king of Moronica, war profiteers Ixnay , Amscray  and Umpchay   have decided that they have had enough of Moe Hailstone, the fascist dictator they put in power, and want to help Herman retake the throne. To this end, he sends his daughter, the princess Gilda  to try and assassinate Hailstone using an explosive pool ball strategically positioned in Hailstone's billiard table. The fictitious country of Moronica  seems to be familiar with a pool game in which the 13 ball is placed at the head of the rack during set up. Dictator Moe Hailstone of Moronica enjoys a shave, and fights Field Marshal Herring  and Minister of Propaganda  for a turkey . The winner of that battle is a picture of Napoleon who grabs the bird from the bewildered Stooges. Gilda enters, and shows the Stooges a glimpse through a telescope of all three of them on a spit roasting in Hell and starts to place in Hailstone's mind the idea that his allies, the "Axel" partners, are plotting against him. After doing this she replaces the 13 ball on Hailstone's pool table with an exploding No. 13 ball and flees as Hailstone begins a pool game with his partners. Throughout the game, the cue ball inexplicably defies the laws of physics, avoiding the exploding ball by swerving around it and finally jumping over it, colliding with Herring's head. Later, the Axel partners arrive for a meeting. The partners consist of Chiselini , the Bey of Rum ; an unnamed Japanese delegate ; and an unnamed Russian delegate . As the meeting breaks into chaos following Hailstone's declaration that the world belongs to him, the Stooges go into action on the other delegates and each other. Finally, with all the other Axels delegates defeated, Hailstone orders Herring to surrender the globe they had fought over. Herring refuses and smashes it over Hailstone's head, sending him into a tantrum. Herring, finally having enough of Hailstone's patronizing antics, yells at Hailstone as he grabs the exploding ball and throws it against the floor in frustration, blowing up the meeting room. Herman regains his throne and the trio's heads are shown mounted on a wall.
