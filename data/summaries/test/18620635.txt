While traipsing through the Ookaboochie Swamps, Daffy Duck seeks to deliver a telegram to "Chloe." He finds the home of "Dr. Jerkyl" and hopes that the physician can cure his hiccups. Daffy's hiccups are so severe that they cause him to damage or destroy everything around him. Dr. Jerkyl captures Daffy and restrains him to a doctor's chair. Hoping to scare Daffy in order to cure his hiccups, Dr. Jerkyl drinks a potion that turns him into an ogre. Terrified, Daffy asks him who he is, and he responds: "I'm Chloe." Daffy then reads him the telegram, which is a cheerful Happy Birthday message from apparently Frankenstein. Chloe chases Daffy around the laboratory until the radio is accidentally switched on, prompting him to dance. Once the music ends, the chase resumes. Daffy scrambles to the lab table and mixes a potion, which turns Chloe into an infant. Off camera, Daffy hits the infant with a hammer, but only from self defense and perhaps to teach him a lesson since the infant Chloe intended to hit him with a hammer . {{s-start}} {{succession box}} {{s-end}}
