Abram  lives in Haran, a rich city. His wife Sarah  is childless, and their only heir is Eliezer of Damascus. One day he hears the voice of God, who says that he must leave Haran and travel to an unknown land. God promises to make a great nation from him and renames him Abraham . The pattern for the plot is the Genesis chapters 11-25.
