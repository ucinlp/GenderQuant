When their latest V-2 rocket test fails and government funding collapses, rocket scientist Dr. Charles Cargraves  and space enthusiast General Thayer  enlist the aid of aircraft magnate Jim Barnes . With the necessary millions raised from a group of adventurous and patriotic industrialists they build a ship at a desert base, but the project is threatened by a public uproar over radiation safety. The three idealists circumvent legal efforts to stop their project by launching ahead of schedule with a substitute radio operator, Joe Sweeney . In space, they almost lose a crewman when they go outside the ship to free a frozen radio antenna. The landing uses up too much fuel, and after exploring the surface they discover that they must lighten the ship if their remaining fuel is to get them back. No matter how much equipment they throw overboard, it looks as though someone will have to stay behind if the other three are to return to the Earth. However, they manage to lift off from the Moon and make it back to home. The film features the premise that US private industry will finance and manufacture the first spacecraft to reach the moon, given the Soviet threat at the time, and then the US government will bring itself to buy or lease the technology. Visionary industrialists are shown cooperating to support the venture.
