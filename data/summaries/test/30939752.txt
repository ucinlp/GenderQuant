The film centers on an Israeli-Mossad team who in 1964 captured a notorious Nazi doctor who had performed human experimentation in a German extermination camp, and, when he escaped from them, reported him as being shot once in the head and killed during his attempted escape. In the following years, the agents received numerous accolades for their actions, with none suspecting the truth, but in the late 1990s, they learn he may be alive, repentant, and likely to expose the truth of the events.Scheib, Ronnie, "'The Debt' ", Variety, November 1, 2008, retrieved August 26, 2011.www.israelemb.org, retrieved August 27, 2011.
