The Honourable Richard Rollison  is a well-known private detective who has friends and contacts in all echelons of society from the wealthy West End set to the lowest East End hovels. He likes to take on cases on behalf of underdogs, and is feared by the criminal underworld for his fearsome reputation of always getting his man. Pretty young secretary Fay Gretton  comes to Rollison, worried that her employer has not shown up for work for several days and cannot be contacted. Rollison breaks into the man's flat and finds a body &ndash; not that of Fay's missing boss, but the son of a millionaire businessman. The missing man is the prime suspect, and it is up to Rollison to get to the bottom of the case, aided by his East End contacts. After a series of dramatic events, including Fay being abducted and tied up, the truth is finally revealed, the missing man is found, and Rollison proves beyond question that he is innocent of any wrongdoing.
