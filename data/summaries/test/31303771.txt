The world of the Hollywood detective division is exposed via The Glitter Dome . When the investigation of a high profile studio president is going nowhere, the case is handed over to two experienced detectives, Al Mackey and Marty Welborn, who have a reputation for being able to solve the toughest cases, through creative means.
