Steven Seagal stars as a tough cop, Jacob King, whose brutal methods have gained him a legendary reputation among his colleagues. Seemingly indifferent to the fact his twin brother was murdered in front of him as a child, Seagal investigates a series of brutal killings, most involving young, attractive women. The murderer, Lazerus, played by Michael Filipowich, leaves cryptic, astronomical clues at the crime scenes. At the same time, another murderer, Billy Joe Hill , is killing women. King finds him and kicks him out a window, after which Hill seeks revenge by murdering Celine , whom he believes to be King's girlfriend. King goes on a brutal rampage through the Memphis underworld with the assistance of his partner, Detective Storm Anderson  and the coroner . King meets FBI agent Frankie Miller  but dislikes her because she doesn't approve of his methods. Lazerus attempts to frame King for the murder of a blonde barmaid, and Miller believes the frame and begins to pursue King. Meanwhile, King locates Lazerus and fights him, using a ball-peen hammer to break every bone in his body. He then goes after Billy Joe Hill and kills him after finding Celine dead. King then runs away, leaving Anderson a note explaining he's quitting because no one likes his style of justice. The final scene shows King returning to what appears to be his Russian wife and family.
