Don José Gran, a rich businessman from Buenos Aires, travels to La Pampa in search for horses. He hires Juan, a noble gaucho that tames horses for a living, to aid him in his search. On that very day, Juan rescues a damsel in distress, María, from a crazed horse. Don José Gran then kidnaps María and goes back to Buenos Aires with her. Juan decides to go uptown and rescue her; a fellow ranch hand, Don Genaro, tags along. Juan and Don Genaro try to go by cart to Buenos Aires, but the vehicle gets stuck, so they take the train instead. Once in Buenos Aires, they ask for directions and end up chasing a fleeing streetcar that takes them all the way to Gran's mansion. Don Genaro gets in trouble for smoking in the streetcar, and decides not to be involved in María's rescue, preferring instead to go shopping for supplies. Juan infiltrates the mansion and waits for Don Gran to arrive; he then fights him and overpowers him. María, who had been previously assaulted by Gran, is supposed dead by Juan and mourns her. As María wakes up, Gran creeps up behind Juan, ready to kill him, but Juan blocks the stab and overcomes him once more. As he is about to kill him, María stops him, claiming that a gaucho would never kill a defenseless man. They escape the mansion and happily board the train home. The last shot shows Don Genaro on his way to the train, losing his step and scattering the supplies over the street. He picks them up, waving young boys away, and picks his way up. After María and Juan return to the country, Gran plans a revenge. He talks the 'comisario' and accuses falsely Juan of being a 'cuatrero'. The 'comisario' begins a search of Juan. María tells Juan to escape. Juan finds Gran and starts a pursuit on horses. Gran reaches a 'zanja' and falls down. Juan goes down and try to help him, but Gran dies. Justice wins. The film ends.
