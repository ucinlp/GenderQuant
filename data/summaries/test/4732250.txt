After the suicide of one of the inmates at a British young offender institution, a group of teenage offenders, along with a prison officer, are sent to a remote island, formerly used as a British Army training area, but now serving as a prison training area. They soon find out they are not alone on the island as some members of the group come across a camp site with two female young offenders and their prison officer. The story develops into a tale of betrayal and vengeance. Strange murders start occurring, and the boys eventually work out that they are being committed by the father of the boy who killed himself, a special forces soldier. One by one the teenagers and their supervisors are picked off, either by the father, his dogs, or by each other.
