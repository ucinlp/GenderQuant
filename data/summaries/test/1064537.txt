{{Plot|dateFlashbackFlash-forward Back in the present, Fenix goes out to a field trip to a movie theater along with other patients, most of whom suffer from Down Syndrome. A pimp intercepts him and four others and persuades them to take cocaine and follow him to a large prostitute. On the way Fenix spots the Tattooed Woman, who is now a prostitute, and becomes filled with rage. The Tattooed Woman is also shown prostituting Alma, who manages to escape the house and runs away into the night. Back in the asylum, Fenix's armless mother Concha calls out for him from the street and he escapes by climbing down his cell window. The Tattooed Woman is then repeatedly stabbed and killed by a pair of womanly hands. Mother and son go on to put an act where he stands behind her and inserts his arms in her sleeves so that she pretends to have arms again. Together they perform mimicry and piano-playing. But soon enough Fenix realizes that his mother can literally take full control of his arms to do her bidding. This does not only include performing day-to-day acts such as eating or knitting, but also killing those women whom she deems a threat to her son. He is forced to kill a young woman in the fashion his father Orgo used to knife-throw, as well as a cross-dressing wrestler, whom he slashes with a sword. It is revealed in a dream that he has killed many more women, all of whose memories haunt him. Alma finds Fenix and together plan to run away from Concha and her house, now fashioned in a similar way to her demolished temple. She tries to force him to murder Alma as well, but after some struggle he manages to plunge a knife into Concha's stomach, apparently killing her. But she reveals to him that she will always be inside him, and vanishes. Through a series of flashbacks it is revealed that Concha actually died after being maimed by Orgo, and that Fenix has kept a mannequin in the fashion of his armless mother while performing both on stage and at home. He destroys the homemade temple and throws away the mannequin with the help of his hallucinated childhood friends, Aladin and the clowns. The police are waiting outside the house and order both Fenix and Alma to put their hands up. Both comply, and Fenix watches his own with awe as he does so. He has regained control of them.
