After the ikiza , the Burundi refugees exiled in Tanzania founded the Party for the Liberation of the Hutu People. Its armed representative is the NLF, the National Liberation Front. In 2006, after prolonged negotiations with the opposition and the Army, the president of Burundi made a public call, over the radio, to all NLF soldiers asking them to step away from the armed front and voluntarily join the peace process. Within this context, Tune in to Peace enters the lives of three young people: Désiré, Jean Claude and Jérémie, all ex members of the NLF.
