The plot of the cartoon involves Duck Dodgers  in his search for the rare element Illudium Phosdex, "the shaving cream atom." In the future, the only remaining supply of the element is on the mysterious "Planet X". After Dodgers plots an enormously complicated course to Planet X, his assistant, the "Eager Young Space Cadet"  points out that they can simply follow a path leading from Planet A, through Planets B, C, D, and so on . Dodgers takes credit for this idea and the two soon arrive on the planet. Just as Dodgers claims the planet in the name of the Earth, Marvin the Martian lands and claims it in the name of Mars, setting the stage for a battle of wits  between the two. A series of exchanges takes place with neither party gaining the upper hand, culminating in each character deploying their "secret weapon", resulting in the complete destruction of Planet X. The cartoon ends with Dodgers dramatically claiming the last remaining chunk of the planet for Earth, while Marvin and the Space Cadet hang helplessly from a root below, the latter ending the cartoon with the punchline , "Eh, b-b-b-b-big deal."
