Scott Calvin/Santa Claus , and his wife, Carol , are expecting their first child as Christmas Eve approaches. Carol is missing her family, so Scott invites his in-laws, Silvia and Bud Newman , up to the North Pole, along with his ex-wife, Laura , her husband, Neil , and their daughter, Lucy , to keep Mrs. Claus company. Meanwhile, he is summoned to a meeting of the Council of Legendary Figures consisting of Mother Nature , Father Time , the Easter Bunny , Cupid , the Tooth Fairy , and the Sandman . Jack Frost  also arrives and is in trouble. He is jealous that he has no holiday or special occasion in his honor, and has been promoting himself during the Christmas season. Mother Nature accuses him of attempting to upstage Santa, and suggests sanctions against him. Frost manages to negotiate a light sentence of community service at the North Pole, but immediately sets out to sabotage operations there. His ultimate goal is to trick Santa into renouncing his position, and he sneaks into Santa's closet of snowglobes and steals the one that involkes the escape clause . When Lucy discovers this crime Jack Frost blackmails her by freezing her parents to force her to remain silent. Jack Frost causes trouble for the family that makes Scott think that he must resign to make things better; Jack tricks Scott into invoking the escape clause and gets to Santa's fallen coat first thus making him top man; Santa. Frost in his Santa job exploits the North Pole into a carnival and through shameless self-promotion, turning it into a tourist trap on the globe with the elves' forced labor where people pay to have kids put on the nice list or to pay to make a toy for the naughty kids. Scott is sent back to the present, where he has been the CEO for his old company for the last twelve years and works even on Christmas Eve. His non-Santa life is a disappointment, with his business taking priority over everything and his son loathing him for his lack of attention over the years. Scott promises to set things right and so wanting his Santa job back he flies to the North Pole and sees the offensive North Pole carnival. He confronts Jack Frost as Santa who is still aware of his trickery on Scott and realizing he cannot reform Frost Scott tricks Jack Frost into putting his voice of the escape clause on a microphone like pen and then has Lucy who is attending the carnival go steal the snowglobe and bring it to him; Jack Frost finds out and takes the globe but Scott then records Jack saying "I wish I'd never been Santa at all" thus invoking the escape clause and causing him and Jack to be sent back to the time when Scott became Santa for the first time and letting Scott restrain Jack enough to let his past figure of Scott get the coat thus making him Santa again and taking him back to the North Pole and the family where no time has passed since. Scott back as Santa, when entering the toy factory reconciles with his family and is happier until he sees Lucy finally get the courage to inform Scott what Frost did to her parents; Jack is arrested by elf police officers and he reveals that he cannot unfreeze his victims unless he is unfrozen himself; Scott and Lucy then use a gift Scott gave her; a snowglobe of her warmly hugging a snowman, to unfreeze Frost and reform him to thus resolve the conflicts in the movie; in the ending Santa sees Buddy Claus get born just 3 hours before he must deliver Christmas gifts.
