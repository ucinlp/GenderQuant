Set in a dystopian 2033, a comet has hit the Earth, and altered the climate turning it into a dry and arid wasteland. There has been no rain for over 11 years - water is extremely scarce, and what little is available is controlled by the Water & Power company, led by Kesslee . Water & Power are opposed by the almost mythical "Rippers", a mysterious group that no one can find. Rebecca - Tank Girl - , is a member of a small community that has set up their own water well in the basement of a house. Learning of this, Water & Power attacks, killing most in the house and capturing Rebecca and a young girl named Sam. Imprisoned, Rebecca is repeatedly brutalized by Kesslee, who wishes to break her spirit, brainwashing her into working for him. Between intellectual jousts with Kesslee, Rebecca befriends Jet Girl  - an otherwise unnamed mechanic who works on Water & Power's vehicles. Water & Power identify a Ripper subgate, and send in Rebecca to locate the actual entrance to their base. The Rippers ambush Water & Power, killing almost all present - except for Kesslee who is critically injured and Rebecca. Jet girl flys in shortly after the attack in a hijacked W&P jet to rescue Rebecca and tell her she wants to escape the clutches of W&P. Rebecca and Jet steal a tank and jet respectively, compounding the reasoning behind their names. In their vehicles Tank Girl and Jet Girl encounter a desert outlaw who informs them that Sam has been taken to the Liquid Silver brothel, and allows them to modify their vehicles in her workshop so as to enter Liquid Silver without arousing suspicion. Tank Girl and Jet Girl infiltrate Liquid Silver, successfully rescuing Sam, but Water & Power are somehow alerted to their presence and they again kidnap Sam, planning on using her as a lure for Tank Girl and Jet Girl. Tank Girl and Jet Girl find the Rippers base  and persuade the Rippers to help defeat their common enemy - Water & Power. Whilst Booga  and Donner  are attracted to Tank Girl and Jet Girl respectively, a suspicious Ripper T-Saint  demands that they carry out a training mission to establish their credentials and sincerity first. Tank Girl and Jet Girl successfully complete their task, retrieving the cargo - suspected to be guns, but are in fact crates weighted with sand - all except for one which contains the desiccated corpse of the Ripper creator Johnny Prophet, suggesting that Kesslee again knew of the Rippers plans. Enraged, the Rippers agree to assist Tank Girl and Jet Girl in their mission to rescue Sam and simultaneously bring down Water & Power. Breaking into groups, Tank Girl assaults by land while the Rippers and Jet Girl infiltrate by air. They reunite briefly and during a shootout the Ripper Deetee  sacrifices himself to destroy the generators which plunges Water & Power into darkness allowing the remaining Rippers to decimate the Water & Power personnel. Jet Girl kills Sgt. Small, who previously had been sexually harassing her, while Tank Girl attempts to rescue Sam, who has been placed down "The Pipe", a tube that gets narrower near the bottom, trapping the victim inside. The pipe is slowly filling with water, meaning that Sam will drown ironically in a world short of water. Kesslee appears - none the worse for his previous injuries - and reveals that Tank Girl herself has been his source of information - he has been monitoring a tracking dart implanted into her earlier. Initially outclassed by Kesslee's cybernetically repaired body, Tank Girl eventually gains the upper hand by shorting out his body with water, and using beer cans as artillery shells fired from her eponymous tank. She eventually kills him with his own preferred weapon - a water extraction device that once stabbed into the victim extracts all the water from the body, leaving nothing but a desiccated husk behind. In an animated epilogue the group reunites, fading to Tank Girl and Booga water skiing in an unidentified location over a waterfall.
