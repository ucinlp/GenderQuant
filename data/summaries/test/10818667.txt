Andie Bradley  is a gymnast with big dreams for the Olympics. When offered to work with one of the leading coaches in the U.S., she gratefully accepts. This requires her to move from Portland, Oregon to Seattle, Washington. When she gets to the gym, she is scrutinized by the coach about her weight and feels the pressure to lose the pounds. At first it's just dieting, but it soon leads to anorexia. When she meets a fellow team member, Leslie , she realizes there are ways around it. "You can eat what you want, and not gain a pound." Andie continues with her diet, but once she cannot handle it she turns to purging methods. Her mom notices changes in her weight, while her boyfriend and best friend also notice changes in her attitude. Andie eventually comes out to her best friend, telling her that she sees the changes and can't stop her behavior. She faints twice, both during competitions, and goes to hospital, after fainting the second time, where a doctor talk to her parents about her body problems. Her parents decide to move back home. Andie runs away to the gym, where she sees a new girl being given the same lecture about her weight that was given to her. She decides that she is not ready to go back to training. After moving back to Portland, Andie joins a support group where she is encouraged to eat as part of her therapy. At the end of the movie, she is seen walking into the school gymnasium and getting back on the balance beam.
