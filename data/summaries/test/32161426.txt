A film about a land dispute. Charles Mortimer  buys cattle from Ken Morley  and builds a fence to keep them in. His neighbour, Slater , is angered by Mortimer's actions because he wants access to the land. By way of revenge, he builds a dam cutting off Mortimer's water supply. Morley confronts Slater, and Slater captures and imprisons him in a shack. The dam is subsequently destroyed by lightning, and the shack holding Mortimer is in the path of the oncoming surge of water.
