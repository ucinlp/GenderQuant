The plot involves a teenager, Frankie , who is left in charge of the family home for a few weeks while his parents are vacationing in Europe. After a day of surfing on the beach, Frankie and his best friend Bogie  happen upon a group of sexy Bohemian vampires led by Moondoggie  along with his minions Sulka and Katrina  and invite them to stay in Frankie's house for a few days in hopes of getting lucky. When Frankie learns that the threesome have some secrets, he enlists the aid of the Big Kahuna, a legendary vampire killer  who teaches Frankie how to solve his vampire problems. The film has attained cult-like status with its tongue in cheek humor and its many references to the Beach Party films of Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello, which were hugely popular in the mid-60's. An appearance by iconic surf guitar legend Dick Dale performing on the beach adds to the retro vibe of the film.
