The film is set in London. Mr. Hobbs , took the job as night janitor 16 years ago at the London Diamond Corporation so he could tend to his ill wife during the day. An executive of the diamond company's insurer, King's Row, was instrumental in denying his wife needed health insurance, and she died as a result. Hobbs has been patiently waiting for years to exact his revenge. He asks Laura Quinn , a disgruntled executive victimized by the company's glass ceiling, to help him steal a thermos full of diamonds from the company for which they both work: the London Diamond Corporation. He has a plan far grander than what he reveals to her, however.
