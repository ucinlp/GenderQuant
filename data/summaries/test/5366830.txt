The hungry Pink Panther wanders the streets, and while longing for a bite to eat, a little dog bites his tail and refuses to let go, so he has to check into a hospital, where the doctor treats him as just another ill patient. Unhappy to be in the hospital, the panther tries to escape by disguising himself as a nurse and the dog as a baby under a blanket, but the plan fails. Finally the doctor gives him some Formula K-9 Dog Remover medicine, which helps, and the dog lets loose of the tail, but then the dog attacks the doctor. The pink panther is then free from the hospital, and he receives a free pie, but however, just before Pink goes out the door, he doesn't know that a person in white clothes is behind a door. The man in white clothes then takes the pie from the plate while Pink isn't looking. Pink then runs off.imdb.com/
