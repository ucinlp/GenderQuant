Liz Erickson  is a young, naive woman who has recently graduated from high school. Along with her best friend Janet Shaw , she leaves her parental home to join the same college - Midwestern University - where her mother was once a legendary alma mater. Liz and Janet dream of being pledged by the elite group of girls who call themselves Tri-U Sorority. Liz thinks that joining a sorority is more important than her education, and is surprised that her fellow roommate Adelaide Swanson  is not interested in Tri-U. During her first weeks in college, Liz has no trouble befriending Tri-U's members, including Dallas Prewitt , Marge Colby , Merry Coombs  and Casey Krausse . Janet, on the other hand, does not make an impression on the snobbish girls. Neither does shy Ruth Gates , whose mother was a respected Tri-U, but she is - unlike Janet - admitted to the pledge due to her family name. Liz is pledged as well, and feels guilty for seeing her dream come true, while Janet, crushed by the rejection, is leaving the college. Meanwhile, she meets Joe Blake , a senior at college and once a member of the army who is opposed to sororities due to its snobbish cliques. Liz is also pushed by arrogant Dallas to date Chad Carnes , the most popular fraternity boy whose reputation as a drunken womanizer is not unnoticed by Liz. She initially does not take a liking in him, but Chad wins over her affection and convinces her to help him cheat at an important exam. Her sorority sisters acclaim her as a hero for her actions, but Joe feels disappointed in her lack of ethics. Soon after, 'Hell Week' begins, which includes humiliating and taking pranks on the new pledges. On insistence of Dallas, Ruth is released from the pledge, while Liz is assigned to make silly errands. She runs into Joe, and agrees to accompany him to a party. Chad also attends this party, and chastises Liz for ignoring her duties. Joe sticks up for her, and gets into a fist fight with Chad. Realizing that Joe is the one she wants to be with, she rejects Chad and returns to Tri-U. There, she is disgusted to find out that Ruth has been de-pledged. She goes out to look for her, and finds her wondering on the streets. Liz takes Ruth to the hospital, where she is diagnosed with pneumonia. Ashamed for being part of a clique that has done this to Ruth, Liz heads back to Tri-U to return her pin. The girls feel that she is out of her mind for doing this, but Liz castigates them for their hypocrisy and snobbishness. She leaves with Joe, wondering how her mother will react.
