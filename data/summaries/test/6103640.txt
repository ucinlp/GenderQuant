The film opens with Mugs trying to avoid being seen on his 18th birthday lest he be given a birthday spanking; which happens first from his own gang, secondly from the rival Cherry Street Gang, and lastly by the neighbourhood policeman. The main plot of the film involves Mugs  and his pals posing as a family to impress a friend of his late father, who is visiting the east side from Texas. The friend "Uncle" Pete Monahan  has been regularly sending checks to Mugs' impoverished mother to help pay for the upbringing of her many children&mdash;none of whom actually exist, except for Mugs. Rather than admit the fraud, Mugs persuades his buddies to pose as his siblings for the friend's visit. This requires Glimpy to dress in drag as a girl and Scruno to claim he was adopted by the family. Pete and his daughter Judy literally ride into the neighbourhood on horseback with both carrying six guns. The charade initially goes well until Pete keeps the gang and Judy out all night at a night club. When the enraged parents of the gang members come over to the McGuinness flat to find out where their children are, Muggs explains the story as Pete and Judy walk in the flat; they hear the story and depart enraged. Sensing an opportunity to make a score, gangsters lure Pete and Judy into capture where the combined gangs of the East Side and Cherry Street rescue them and give the gangsters a beating. There is no mention of "Clancy Street" in the film, but a rival gang at Cherry Street appears at the beginning and climax of the film.
