Set on the Kidabanesee reserve in Northern Ontario. Silas Crow  is a young man confused about his direction in life; he wants to take an automobile mechanic's course in college, but is uncertain whether he should apply. His general confusion with life is most readily evident in his appearance. He wears an old, ratty black hat resembling a fedora, a strange assortment of cargo pants, as well as a long, black trench coat. Frank Steelpost  is Crow's best friend, and Katie Maracle  is his girlfriend. Events are set in motion when a young girl from the reserve is murdered by Clarence Gaskill , a white man who gets off with a light sentence, prompting the community to demand vengeance..
