The film begins with a view of the SS Claridon, as a narrator states "The SS Claridon, a proud ship, a venerable ship, but as ships go, an old ship. A very old ship. For thirty-eight years, she's weathered everything the elements could throw at her. Typhoons, zero-zero fogs, the scorching heat of the tropics. Now she is scheduled for only five more crossings. Then a new ship, a plush, streamlined beauty will take her place. It is then that the Claridon will pass into oblivion. She has an appointment with the scrapyard. But, it's an appointment she'll never keep. For this is her last voyage." Cliff and Laurie Henderson and their daughter Jill are relocating to Tokyo and decide to sail there on board the ship. A fire in the boiler room is extinguished quickly, but not before several safety valves have been fused shut. When Chief Engineer Pringle attempts to open one, a huge explosion rips through the room and the many decks situated above it, killing him and some of the passengers and trapping Laurie under a steel beam in her stateroom, in addition to causing widespread panic and opening a huge hole in the side of the ship. Cliff runs back to their stateroom and finds that he can't get Laurie out alone. He then finds Jill trapped on the other side of the room. He tries to use a shattered piece of the bed to get to the other side, but it falls through the huge hole caused by the explosion. Third Officer Osborne believes that the crew should start loading the passengers into the lifeboats, but Captain Robert Adams is reluctant, as he's never lost a ship. He tries to reassure them that they are in no immediate danger but this doesn't help calm them. Cliff finally manages to rescue Jill by using a board to have her crawl across the hole on. Down in the boiler room, Second Engineer Walsh reports to the captain that a seam to the bulkhead has broken away. Cliff tries to get the help of a steward, but to no avail. A passenger states that he overheard his conversation, and wants to help. Osborne reports that the boiler room is now half-full. The Claridon then begins to transmit an SOS, on orders of Captain Adams. Cliff and a few other men return to the stateroom to try and help free Laurie, but find they need a torch. The carpenter reports to the crew that the boiler room is now two-thirds full. To make matters worse, Walsh doesn't know how long the bulkhead will last. Captain Adams makes an announcement to the passengers to put on their life jackets. This is more reason to panic. They then begin loading and launching the lifeboats. Cliff finds a torch, and tries to rush back to Laurie with the help of crewman Hank Lawson. Walsh reports that if one more strut breaks, the ship will sink. The boiler room then floods, causing the ship to sink lower. Also, a second explosion happens on the boat deck. When Cliff and Lawson are down in the dining room, it too floods, causing water to burst through the large windows. Captain Adams is looking at his promotion letter to commodore of the line when he is killed after one of the smokestacks falls on him. Meanwhile, Cliff finally gets Laurie out from under the steel beam with the help of Lawson and Walsh. They get up to the boat deck along with Walsh. Cliff, Laurie, Jill, and Lawson jump into the water and find a lifeboat just as the ship sinks. Walsh is shown swimming away, and the narrator concludes with "This was the death of the steamship Claridon. This was her last voyage."
