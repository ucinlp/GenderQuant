In Ireland, Jerry Kelly  marries his sweetheart, Nellie Noonan  over the objections of her ne'er-do-well father, Michael Noonan , who swears never to speak to Jerry again, even though he reluctantly accompanies the newlyweds to America, where Jerry becomes a policeman, and all three become citizens. Michael continues to hold his grudge against Jerry, even when Nellie dies while giving birth to little Nellie. Years later, Jerry is now a captain on the police force, and little Nellie  has grown up as the spitting image of her mother. When Nellie becomes enamored of Dennis Fogarty , the son of Michael's old friend Timothy Fogarty , the squabbling between Nellie's father and grandfather intensifies, as Michael objects to the romance, and finally leaves home because of it. Eventually, the three generations are reconciled, and Nellie and Dennis remain a couple.TCM Full synopsisErickson, Hal Plot synopsisBubbeo, Daniel Plot summary
