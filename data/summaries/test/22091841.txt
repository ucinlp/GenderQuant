After each is accepted to the Naval Academy, three young men, Dick Gates, Roger Ash and "Truck" Cross, decide to become roommates. Dick is tricked into committing a rules violation toward Harnett, an upperclassman. Roger gets even by challenging Harnett to a boxing match and winning it. Truck becomes attracted to Dick's sister, Pat. He also faces expulsion for not properly identifying himself upon admission to the academy, which is revealed when Truck tries to clear the sullied reputation of his father. Roger also runs into trouble when he is found drunk in a bar, but the school's former football coach covers for him. Truck, a gifted football player, is cleared of all charges in time to race to the stadium and help win the Army-Navy game for his side.
