Miley Cyrus stars as Molly, a private investigator who chose to leave high school to work with her father , a former police officer. Together their days are filled with busting cheating spouses and taking down petty thieves. However, her life unexpectedly changes when she is approached by an FBI agent  to go undercover in the one place they're unable to infiltrate, and a world she knows nothing about... A university sorority. During a major makeover, Molly physically transforms herself from the tough, streetwise investigator, to a very affluent sorority girl Brooke Stonebridge. However, Molly also has to learn how to walk the walk and talk the talk to keep her cover for her mission: protect the life of sorority sister Alex Patrone  whose father plans to testify against some very dangerous people. Surveillance proves nearly impossible for outsider Molly, who struggles to adjust to university culture, her new friends, and her new assignment, which includes Nicholas , a strong, self confident guy who may have taken a piece of Molly's heart, if only he weren't possibly the hit man in disguise. With multiple suspects on her list and the trial fast approaching, Molly must navigate a minefield of double crosses as well as the pageantry and chaos of a sorority sister's social life. Through her journey, Molly must protect Alex while discovering that not everyone is who he or she appears to be, including herself.
