During World War II, the people of Naples are forced to work in slave camps by the occupying Germans. They grow tired of the oppression, and revolt against the invaders, armed with any weapon they can find. The revolt lasts four days, and they eventually drive the Germans from the city before the arrival of allied troops, advancing from the Salerno beach head.
