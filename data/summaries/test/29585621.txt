Opening - The Wiggles wave their hands up high from the song "Whenever I Hear This Music" and the Wiggle Time logo is showing in front. Jeff has fallen asleep while standing and then Anthony, Greg and Murray arrive. Murray suggests they wake him up, and Greg has everyone yell "Wake Up Jeff!" at the count of 3. They count: "1, 2, 3, Wake Up, Jeff!" Jeff jumps and screams, running around to the back of the set and then to the front. Anthony asks Jeff if he's awake now and he affirms. Now it's time to Wiggle! * Song 1: Get Ready To Wiggle Greg tells everyone that there going to sing a song all about four animals. And at the end of the song, he says that let's all growl like a scary bear. * Song 2: Here Comes A Bear While Jeff, Greg and Murray are growling at the end of the song, Captain Feathersword arrives and tickles them with the feathersword. Greg tells Captain Feathersword to stop tickling him, and Captain Feathersword agrees, stating he can show them a pirate dance they can learn. * Song 3: Captain Feathersword Murray introduces the next song about a man who lived a long, long, time ago. His name was Noah and he had to save some animals from a flood so he built a really, really big boat and called it an ark. As Murray lists off the animals, the other Wiggles make the sounds: duck quacking, cow mooing, rooster crowing, cats meowing. He also makes some gestures such as the goats shaking their heads and the long-eared donkeys going hee-haw. * Song 4: Uncle Noah's Ark The Wiggles and some kids are doing paintings using droppers. Anthony holds out his dropper and remarks that it looks like rain. * Song 5: I Love When It Rains Anthony talks about Dorothy the Dinosaur. Wherever she goes, sings and plays, she comes along with the Wiggles, she says "romp bomp a chomp." Dorothy the Dinosaur loves to sing with children, but they don't know where she is. Anthony asks that if you know where Dorothy is? Dorothy walks in from the right but at the back of the set. The Wiggles hear from the audience where she is but she moves whenever they look in that direction. After a few misses, Dorothy walks up behind Jeff. Greg tells Jeff that Dorothy is behind him. Jeff looks to his left but Dorothy moves behind him and out of sight. After some more misses, Jeff looks and sees Dorothy in surprise. They all sing the next song. * Song 6: Dorothy The Dinosaur * Greg's Magic Trick - Coloring Book Trick * Song 7: Sing A Song Of Polly  Greg is a magician, wearing a top hat and cape. He does a magic trick where he flips through a book that initially does not have any pictures. He asks the audience to say some magic words and throw some pictures into the book. He flips through the book and it has some drawings. "Did you do that? Raise your hand if you did. You're all so clever!" He then asks to put some color into the picture by rubbing their clothes. He flips through the book but there is no color. He realizes he forgot to use his magic wand. How silly. He has everyone rub their clothes again and throw the colors at the book. He waves the wand and says "Abracadabra." He then flips through the book and there is color on the drawings. Raise your hand if you did that. Now give yourselves a really big clap. Well done. Greg then disappears. * Song 8: Whenever I Hear This Music Jeff wears an extra purple shirt over his head and makes a blubbering noise; he asks if you know what he is. He's an octopus. He blubbers again and then pokes his head through the top. He's not really an octopus, it's just Jeff. And then he tells that he has a friend who is an octopus and his name is Henry the Octopus. * Song 9: Henry The Octopus The Wiggles are sitting on the floor with some kids who are holding teddy bears. They are having a picnic. Greg says that he knows a song about teddy bears, and he asks if everyone can sing and do the actions with them. * Song 10: Rock A Bye Your Bear The Wiggles and some kids are seated at a table, making fruit salad. Anthony explains how it's done and to make sure there is an adult present, and to use a plastic knife. * Song 11: Fruit Salad Anthony leads The Wiggles and some kids in a line. The kids are holding presents. He stops and tells everyone they are going to Dorothy the Dinosaur's birthday party and that you can come along. Then they continue marching around singing and then walk off the set. * Song 12: Marching Along * Song 13: Dorothy's Birthday Party Greg remarks what a great party it was, but now they're tired so it's time to go. They all say goodbye and fell asleep except for Jeff, who tries to wake everyone up but they don't wake up. Jeff then crosses his arms and shakes his head with a sigh.
