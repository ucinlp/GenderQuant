Hugh  and Miriam Halsworth  are in the final stages of their divorce procedure. Miriam wants to separate because he's addicted to gambling - although he often wins. She's living with her daughter Barbara , her son-in-law Jerry Denham  and her little grandchild. Hugh, who's living next door to them, makes fuzz to the gardener about his rosebushes. Hugh is also Jerry's boss. They are society reporters, and have to follow Victor Macfarland , a self-made multimillionaire who's after a seat in the Senate. Twenty years ago Hugh and Victor were rivals for Miriam's hand. A blonde fortune hunter, Joyce Mannering , is trying to attract Victor, but he's only interested in winning back Miriam. She accepts his marriage proposal, but is disappointed when he postpones the marriage for an appointment in Washington. Just before he steps on the plane he explains to Miriam why he left her twenty years ago . Miriam is furious with Hugh but he doesn't know why. She refuses to let him in, which leads to a comical intermezzo in which Hugh and Jerry are arrested by the police. They are identified by Miriam and Barbara, and may leave the police station. Back home Miriam explains to Hugh that she was so angry because Victor told her that twenty years ago Hugh won her hand in a game of craps. Hugh admits this, and still has those two dice with him. He asks her to throw. It turns out the dice were loaded; they always throw three and four. Hugh admits he cheated because the stake was so high. Miriam is pleased with this explanation and they reconcile.
