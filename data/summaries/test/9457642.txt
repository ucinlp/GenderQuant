Harry Bliss  runs a guard dog service and is going through counseling with his wife, Adele . A serial killer is on the loose in Los Angeles, so when the apartment of classical singer Joan Spruance  is ransacked and she starts receiving threatening phone messages, Joan moves into the Hollywood Hills home of her sister, Andy . Joan doesn't feel safe there, either, because she's harassed by Andy's ex-lovers. She hires a guard dog from Harry's company, and soon Harry is providing more than protection for the beautiful singer. Harry is a natural-born liar who, because of his profession, feels that he lives by a code of honor — even if he can't quite explain it — as one thing after another spins out of his control. Joan is soft and vulnerable as she is badgered by her conductor husband, harassed by unknown callers, menaced by men from her sister's past, and "helped" by Harry.
