A young female scanner is troubled by the painful side-effects of her powers. This drives her to try her adoptive father's experimental drug called Eph3  - a variant of the Ephemerol, which cuts off moral conscience and causes her to become a megalomaniac. She kills her father and takes over his pharmaceutical company. Her long-lost adopted brother, also a Scanner, is alerted to her dangerous behavior and returns to stop her. As her rise to power and desire for global dominance gains momentum, her brother must fend off the attackers sent after him and ultimately defeat his sister to save the world.
