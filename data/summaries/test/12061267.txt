The film centers on Park Ranger Hollister , who is at odds with the Park supervisor  over a large rock concert that is going to be held in the area. Hollister fears that the local grizzly population might be a danger to the attendees. When a grizzly kills a local poacher and three teens, Hollister begins to track the bear with the help of a bear activist  and a local bear hunter named Bouchard . In addition, four poachers set out together to try to trap the bear, hoping to gain the $100,000 reward money. But the alleged 18-foot grizzly makes its way to the rock concert, making the climatic showdown all the more personal for Hollister as his daughter  is working there backstage.
