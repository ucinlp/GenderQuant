Jim Douglas  is a rancher who has been pursuing the four outlaws who murdered his wife six months earlier. He rides into the town of Rio Arriba, where four men, Alfonso Parral , Bill Zachary , Ed Taylor  and Lujan , fitting the description are in jail awaiting execution, so that he can see the hanging. The town has issued instructions to only allow the hangman  to enter, so Jim is taken to Sheriff Eloy Sanchez's  office to state his business. The town has never had an execution before, so they have brought in a man from outside town to do the job. The sheriff allows Jim into the jail to see the men. They claim they had never seen him before, but he has the face of a hunter. In town Jim meets Josefa Velarde . He met her five years previously in New Orleans but hasn't seen her since. Through their conversation we learn that she was husband hunting when they met before. She has been looking after her father's ranch since he died. Jim reveals to her that he has a daughter . Other inhabitants of the town include businessman Gus Steimmetz, his daughter Emma  and her fiance Tom . The executioner, Simms, arrives the same day. He drinks with Jim, but is generally unfriendly. The sheriff invites Simms to see the men he is to hang, but Simms holds off until the town is at church for a pre-execution mass. While pretending to evaluate the men he is to hang, Simms stabs the sheriff in the back. The sheriff shoots and kills Simms in the struggle, but inmates strangle the sheriff unconscious and take his keys. The four escape and capture Emma as a hostage. The wounded sheriff comes into the church during the service and tells the townspeople that the prisoners have escaped. The townspeople form a posse to ride out immediately. They enlist Jim's aid to track them down, but Jim waits until morning. The posse is held up at a pass when one of the four men sets up as a sniper. Jim catches up with the posse the next day while they are held up trying to dislodge one of the four. Jim corners Parral, who pleads for his life before Jim kills him. Then Jim ropes Taylor by the feet and hangs him upside-down from a tree. The two remaining men reach the house of John Butler , a prospector and Jim's neighbor. Zachary kills Butler and Lujan steals the sack of coins he tried to run off with, but they see someone approaching in the distance and leave in a panic, leaving Emma behind. The people coming turn out to be Josefa and Jim, arriving from different directions. Jim identifies the body, and the posse arrives and finds Emma, raped by Bill Zachary, in the house. Jim tells the posse to ride on while he goes back to his ranch to get fresh horses. However, when Jim arrives home, he finds that the fugitives have taken his last horses. Leaving Josefa with his daughter, he rejoins the posse. When they arrive at the Mexican border, Jim goes on alone. He finds Zachary in a bar and kills him in a gunfight. He then goes on to the home of the fourth man Lujan. When Jim shows a photo of his wife to Lujan, Lujan insists he has never seen the woman before, and recalls that he and his companions rode past the Douglas ranch on their way from the border. Pointing to the sack, Jim states that the men who killed his wife stole the sack containing the family's life savings. When Lujan tells Jim that he took the bag from Butler's dead hand, Jim realizes that Butler killed his wife. Jim sees that he had been pursuing men who had nothing to do with his wife's death. Indeed, when he showed each of them a picture of his wife, all of them denied ever having seen her. Jim realizes that he is no better than the men he has been pursuing, having killed in cold blood. He returns to town and goes to the church to beg forgiveness. The priest  says that he did what he felt was right and to his credit, does not take refuge in the fact that they were outlaws anyway. Josefa then arrives with Jim's daughter, and as they exit the church together, the sheriff, who has recovered, thanks Jim for his service to the town.
