Ben White  attends the funeral of his sister, journalist Karen White, the heroine of the previous film. Ben meets both Jenny Templeton , one of Karen's colleagues, and Stefan Crosscoe , a mysterious interloper who tells him Karen was a werewolf. Providing videotaped evidence of the transformation – and turning up to destroy Karen as her undead body rises from the grave – Crosscoe convinces Ben and Jenny to accompany him to Transylvania to battle Stirba, an immortal werewolf queen. Ben dons a Canadian tuxedo to prepare for the battle. Along the way, the trio encounter Mariana ([[Marsha Hunt , another lusty werewolf siren, and her minion Erle . Arriving in the Balkans, Ben and company wander through an ethnic folk festival, unaware that Stirba is off in her nearby castle already plotting their downfall. Stirba seems to have witchcraft powers as well as being a werewolf, for she intones the Wiccan chant Eko Eko Azarak.Eventually, the adventurers do battle with Stirba in an assault that involves disguised dwarves, mutilated priests, supernatural parasites, and surprise revelations. The Howling II introduces many new elements into the mythos of the werewolf, including a background richly steeped in sorcery and occultism. The primary antagonist of this film, Stirba , is a ten-thousand year-old werewolf and the mother of all werewolves on the planet Earth. Werewolves directly linked to Stirba's brood are stronger than the traditional werewolf, and as such, additional measures are required in order to destroy them. Silver is ineffective against these sort of werewolves. Only weapons made of titanium can end these creatures once and for all.
