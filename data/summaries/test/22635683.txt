One night, an unknown man phones St. Trinians and bribes a girl, Celia, to find an old ring in the school library. She is caught by the other girls, and forced to explain that the man offered her £20,000 for the ring. The other girls propose to get a higher amount of money from the man, and make the attempt when he calls, but he refuses and then proceeds to threaten them. Afterwards, the girls ask the headmistress, Camilla Fritton, about why the ring might be so valuable. She tells thems a story about Pirate Fritton, her ancestor, who supposedly hid a great treasure somewhere in the world. He had two rings made, which when fitted together reveal the location of the treasure. The man on the phone who wanted the ring so badly is Sir Piers Pomfrey, a member of a secret society, and descendant of a man robbed by Pirate Fritton in 1589. Sir Piers manages to steal the ring from headmistress Camilla. The girls decide to search for the second ring, and find a clue left by another ancestor of the Frittons, who found the first ring  and believed he knew where to look for the second. After a difficult deciphering of the clue, a midnight hunt in a graveyard, and disguising themselves to infiltrate another school, the girls find the elusive second ring at last. Now, all that is left is to steal back the ring that Sir Piers took. They begin by researching Sir Piers, who has a wonderful, seemingly flawless reputation, and discover that he knows Geoffrey Thwaites—an old flame of Camilla Fritton from the previous film. Camilla tracks him down to ask for help, and he informs her that Sir Piers is the head of a secret society known only as AD1. Geoffrey joins forces with the girls of St. Trinians, believing that it is high time someone takes Sir Piers down a peg or two. They organise an undercover attempt to break into the headquarters of AD1 and retrieve the first ring, only to find that it isn’t in the secret society’s vault. Luckily, Geoffrey realizes where the ring really is , and manages to get it back to St. Trinians, with only one or two misunderstandings by the others. At last the two rings are together, and they reveal the treasure’s location. After organising a flash mob to keep AD1 from following them, a small group of the girls, their headmistress, and Geoffrey Thwaites head for their new destination. They reach a secret room, and open a chest—only to find that there are no golden riches waiting for them. But what they do find is another treasure entirely: two surprising secrets held by Pirate Fritton. First; that he wrote plays under the name William Shakespeare, and second; that he was in fact a she, a secret the AD1 could never let be revealed. Sir Piers Pomfrey reaches the girls and takes the evidence they have found, threatening them. Just as he is about to make a getaway down the Thames aboard his private boat, destroying the evidence, one of the girls of St. Trinians has an idea. The girls sail the reconstruction of the Golden Hind down the Thames, and shooting cannons at Pomfrey's boat. Then, Miss Fritton swings down and swipes the evidence from Pomfrey's hands. The end shows St Trinian's throwing a wild party.
