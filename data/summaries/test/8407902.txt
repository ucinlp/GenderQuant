In this cartoon, Bugs Bunny is doing a bit of spring cleaning. He ducks into his hole when a small bird  zooms past. He then sees a deer jump over him, and wonders "what's all the excitement about?" Then a whole stampede of animals appears, and Bugs tries to ask them what's going on, but all of his "What's up, doc?" queries go unanswered. He manages to stop a turtle by putting a shovel in front of him. Bugs asks the turtle what was happening, with the turtle explaining that "the Tasmanian Devil's on the loose! Run! Run! Run for your life!". Bugs then goes back into his hole and looks in the encyclopedia to find this character in it. This cartoon, in fact, is the Tasmanian Devil’s first appearance in Warner Bros.' Looney Tunes cartoons. Bugs Bunny gets himself into this situation because he offers to help the disheveled Tasmanian Devil find his dinner. The following quote illustrates Bugs’ realization that Taz is in fact a threat and danger to him: "Q..R..S..T, Tasmanian ... Here it is! 'A strong, murderous beast, jaws powerful as a steel-trap &mdash; has ravenous appetite &mdash; eats tigers, lions, elephants, buffaloes, donkeys, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, giraffes, octopuses, moose, ducks," the Tasmanian Devil then appears next to him and interjects, "Rabbits". Bugs, not noticing him at first, states that "It doesn't say rabbits here..." but Taz handwrites it into the encyclopedia, thus getting the rabbit's attention. That is when Bugs Bunny realizes that he is in danger and that the Tasmanian Devil could in fact potentially attack and eat him. He then convinces Taz that he  would not satisfy his appetite. He tells him that groundhogs would do so; Bugs hands him a shovel and ends up burying him. Just when Bugs thinks he's done with him, the Tasmanian Devil asks: "What for you bury me in the cold, cold ground?" Taz then attacks him, Bugs then feigns smelling chicken nearby which excites Taz. Bugs makes the chicken from liquid bubble gum and baking soda which Taz immediately devours. He then starts hicupping and creates a giant bubble and begins to drift away. Bugs takes out a slingshot and shoots Taz down causing him to become entangled in the gum caught in a tree branch. Next Bugs makes a pig out of an inflatable raft. Taz swallows it and Bugs pulls the string causing the raft to inflate inside of him. Then Bugs creates a deer out of wood. He then sees the Tasmanian Devil after him and climbs up a tree, which Taz chomps down on causing it to become smaller with each bite. Bugs diverts his attention to the crudely made wooden deer  and tells him to knock it out with a giant slingshot . As Taz pulls down on the slingshot, Bugs saws down the tree that is used for the slingshot causing Taz to go flying off and crash. As Bugs laughs at Taz's misfortune, a real fawn (resembling [[Bambi  appears next to him. He warns the fawn of the Tasmanian Devil , not knowing that Taz is right behind him . "Flattery will get you nowhere", Taz says to Bugs, "and you can't fool me again". Bugs attempts to convince him that the fawn is made of straw. Taz replies: "But you're not!" After trying to bite Bugs' face off, he starts to chase him, devouring everything he comes across. Bugs hides in a tree hole and calls a delivery service for a lonely Female Tasmanian Devil whom Taz immediately falls in love with . Bugs pretends to be a minister and pronounces them "Devil and Devilish". The couple then ride off in the airplane that the She-Devil came on. Bugs ends the cartoon with the line: "All the world loves a lover, but in this case I'll make an exception".
