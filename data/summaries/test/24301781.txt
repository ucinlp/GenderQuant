Rich kid and party animal Gardner Pruitt III , known as “Ding” to his friends, is on the prowl for a new conquest in the form of teenager Sandy Palmer . In the meantime, Ding’s influential grandfather, B.S. Cronin  wants to curtail the romance and shut down a popular local college teen hangout. Sandy’s guardians Sid Hoyt  and Woody Woodbury  get mixed up in the proceedings, with Woody becoming the college kid’s hero at the hangout. That sends up a red flag to the college administration, which sends in Dr. Pauline Swenson to investigate allegations of underage drinking. When the clever kids discover that ex-gangster Grandpa Cronin used to be a bootlegger, they blackmail him into keeping the club open.
