In Bruxelles, two rival gangs of gangsters confront each other. One is led by Vicky, propritor of a night club on a barge, and the other by Bug who want to reign over the lucrative night life business. Vicky and her gang, who are planning a bank raid, are going to see their plans confounded by Bug. In effect, he is being manipulated by a police officer who forces him to help break up a drug trafficking deal in return for keeping his residence in Belgium. Bug and Yoko will strongly compromise the bank raid, believing that is linked to the drugs.
