A homeless Daffy Duck is trying to find a place to sleep in a City Park. Porky is a cop, who is telling Daffy that sleeping in the park is against the law . After being kicked out of the park, Daffy complains that it is "the coldest night in 64 years" and wonders where he is going to sleep. Daffy spots a department store window that with a comfortable living room-type display and goes inside. Porky sees him and comes in the store using a skeleton key. A series of chases ensues similar to cartoons where Bugs Bunny is being pursued by Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, or some other predator, with Daffy  always outmaneuvering Porky . The cartoon ends with Daffy begging for sympathy from Porky for the sake of his two kids . Porky takes pity, telling Daffy that he can stay at the store, and justifying it by saying to himself that he understands Daffy's situation because he has three kids of his own .
