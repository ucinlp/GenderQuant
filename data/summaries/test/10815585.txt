After surviving a sneak attack on himself and fellow feds Jimmy  and Gene ([[Michael Gregory  as they transport drug kingpin Raymond Manta  out of a Mexican jail, FBI agent Jeff Douglas  becomes an uwitting pawn of the White Hand drug cartel. Erroneously informed that his already slain family is being held hostage, Jeff is forced to turn one-time courier for the White Hand, whose leaders are Manta and four othersâ€”Helmut Vitch , Milt Kowalski , Russ LaFleur , and Hansel Lee . After surviving a car-bombing in Las Vegas, Jeff learns the truth about his family, and a devastated Jeff angrily sets out to exterminate the White Hand cartel. Officially censured but unofficially aided by concerned agent Megan , whose mother was raped and murdered years ago, Jeff steals some FBI files and kicks off his cartel extermination campaign by killing Vitch in Las Vegas, at Vitch's casino. In New Orleans, Jeff sabotages LaFleur's liquid-heroin deal with a factory fire, and then at LaFleur's night club, Jeff finishes him off in full view of a satellite hook-up watched by Manta and Kowalski at their hide-out. After that, Jeff kills Lee in his heavily guarded mansion in Seattle. After Megan arrives to speed up Jeff's getaway, the couple is apprehended by local cops, and then ambushed by Manta's men. Although Megan is captured and taken away in a helicopter, Jeff momentarily flees. Tired of the whining Kowalski, Manta kills Kowalski at his complex, but endures a savage beating from Jeff, who rescues Megan. Under arrest at FBI headquarters, Manta says it's not over by a long shot. Manta grabs a gun, and in an effort to disarm Manta, Jeff plows into Manta, sending Manta through a window. As a result, Manta takes a fall to his death, which completes Jeff's mission to wipe out the White Hand cartel.
