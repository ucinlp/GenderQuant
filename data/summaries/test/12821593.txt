Candela, who is loved by Carmelo, marries José in a pre-arranged marriage decided by their respective fathers. José is in love with the flirtatious Lucía and dies defending her honor. Carmelo is mistakenly arrested for the killing, and spends several years in prison. After being released, he declares his love for Candela. Although Candela is now "free" to marry Carmelo she is haunted  by the ghost of José, who reappears every night to dance with her. Candela, while speaking with Lucía, learns that José pursued her even after he married Candela. She renounces him, but is unable to shake his hold on her. Tía Rosario provides the solution - Lucia must dance with José, an act which will exorcise his ghost forever.
