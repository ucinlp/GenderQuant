The movie is a lesson on how to live life, taking up the lives of Hari  and Aarthi  who are deaf and mute. They meet, fall in love, get married, have a child who they bring up to be well educated and who gets married to a girl similar to his parents. All they have to help them is their hope, confidence and some kindness in the society along with Uncle Narayan who is blind. Tragedy strikes their lives as well when they lose their first child thanks to Kanu's greed. But they never give up hope on life and not in one instance during the entire movie do they think about ending it. They live life, fight it and succeed in it at a bigger scale than any normal person.
