Vettivel, a son of a potter, is the most intelligent of the lot and loves Kokila who is the daughter of a rich Jamindar who owns the school land. And their common friends are Muthu and Kumaraswami. Kumaraswami, very bad at studies, avoids school; however, his father makes all efforts to send him back to school and succeeds in doing so. A young and beautiful Doctor, Jhansi  arrives at the village and befriends the foursome. Jhansi slowly becomes the godfather figure to all the four. And when Muthu loses his father and becomes an orphan, Jhansi takes him into his custody. Vetrivel and Kokila's love is made public and the villagers blame Jhansi. They throw her out of the village and Muthu accompanies her. What follows is the disentanglement of the plot on the plight of Jhansi, Muthu, Kumaraswami, Vettivel, and Kokila. Eventually the rest of the story and the climax also unravel whether the school escapes the wrath of the landowner.
