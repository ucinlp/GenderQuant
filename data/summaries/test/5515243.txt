Edward Malus , an American policeman, receives news from his ex-fianc√©e, Willow Woodward , that her daughter, Rowan , is missing. He gets a pilot ([[Matthew Walker  to take him to an island off the coast of Washington where a group of neo-pagans live. The island is led by Sister Summersisle , an elderly woman who is treated like a goddess. The economy of the island relies on the production of local honey, which Malus learns has been down recently. Malus asks the villagers about Rowan, but they give him evasive answers. He later sees two men carrying a large bag that appears to be dripping blood, then he finds a fresh, unmarked grave in the churchyard. The grave turns out to only contain a burned doll, but Malus finds Rowan's sweater in the churchyard. At the village school, teacher Sister Rose  tries to prevent Malus from seeing the class register. When he sees that Rowan's name has been crossed out he becomes enraged at the teacher's and Rowan's classmates' lies. Rose demands Malus talk outside and, after a short discussion of the island people's view of death, Rose explains that Rowan is "not missing". Malus asks how Rowan died and Rose tells him first that "She'll burn to death". When Malus catches the tense she used, Rose corrects herself quickly, saying, "She burned to death," and rushes back to her class. On the day of the ritual, Malus frantically searches the village for Rowan. He attacks Sister Beech , who has a bear costume for the ritual. Malus steals her costume and joins the parade led by Sister Summersisle. The parade ends at the site of the festival. Rowan is tied to a large tree, about to be burned. Malus rescues Rowan and they run away through the woods, but Rowan leads him back to Sister Summersisle. Sister Summersisle thanks Rowan for her help, and Malus realizes that the search for Rowan was a trap. The villagers attack Malus and overpower him . Then the women carry him to a giant wicker man and shut him inside. Rowan sets fire to the wicker man and Malus is sacrificed. The crowd chants "The drone must die!", believing that Malus's sacrifice will restore their honey production. The last scene is shown with Willow and Sister Honey  going into a bar and talking with two male police officers . The women invite them to go home with them, presumably in hopes of luring them just as Malus was. Screaming from Edward Malus can be heard as the film fades into dark .
