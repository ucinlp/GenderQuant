Maria is a single woman of forty plus, living alone with her mother, running a quiet business of putting up tourists in her house by the sea and a small restaurant. She has the good fortune of owning a land and a house in a prime spot by the sea which is eyed by developers. The subject of sale of land in Goa and the outsider/insider issue has been plaguing the state for sometime and O Maria revolves around the same subject. In 2009 another Konkani film Zagor was also made on the same lines. Maria  is a middle aged single woman who lives with her ailing mother  and has foreign tourists as paying guests at her beachside home while she also runs a small restaurant. While one of her brother's sons Kevin  looks upon her as a mother, the other Jack  teams up with his mother, Philomena  to sell their ancestral property which is at a prime location to a Gujarati property developer Jiten Shah 'Jitubhai' . For this he needs Mariaâ€™s approval because her brother John  has already signed an agreement to this effect. Mike , an American staying as a guest with Maria, also gets dragged into the issue. Cory Goldberg had earlier played the role of a tourist in the Incredible India ad campaign.<ref namerNWeBVBqo2c] Ruzar  plays the sacristan who gets the villages together.
