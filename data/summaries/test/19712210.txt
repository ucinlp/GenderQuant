It is the story of a young musician Dick Powell, sent to Hollywood, to become a star. It doesn't work out at first but he triumphs in the end. Great musical numbers and light comedy. In his second  film appearance, a youthful Ronald Reagan appears briefly as the announcer during a scene at a Hollywood film premiere. The film also co-stars comedian Ted Healy, as a wise-cracking Hollywood photographer. Healy is perhaps best known for creating the Vaudeville act which later evolved into The Three Stooges. Ironically, "Hollywood Hotel" was released in January 1938, less than a month after Healy's untimely death.
