The film's principal characters are the members of a wealthy English family living in a secluded manor house in the English countryside, and whose names are synonymous with their roles within the family: Mumsy , Nanny , Sonny , and Girly . Despite being in their twenties, Sonny and Girly act like prepubescent children, dressing in English school uniforms and sleeping in giant cribs in a room full of toys. The family's lives are built around an elaborate role-playing fantasy, called "The Game", which is structured around a set of ill-defined yet strictly enforced rules. Because a rich childhood is incomplete without friends, Sonny and Girly regularly seek out male loners, the homeless, and hippies to lure back to their house , where they are then forced to play "The Game". Should the "new friends" refuse, they are "put on trial" and then "sent to the angels"-- a euphemism for being made the victim in snuff films produced by Sonny in which he ritualistically hunts down and murders the men on the manor grounds. One night, Girly and Sonny stake out a swinging London party, where they encounter a male prostitute ([[Michael Bryant  and his latest client . An instant attraction develops between Girly and the man, who convinces his client to accompany the siblings for a night of carousing. Girly and Sonny take the couple to a playground, where they murder the woman by throwing her off of a large slide. The next morning, Sonny and Girly convince the hungover man that he murdered the woman after a night of heavy drinking, and convince him to return to the manor with them. The prostituteâ€”rechristened "New Friend"-- is outfitted in schoolboy clothes and subjected to an indeterminate period of torment "playing the game," during which he is repeatedly presented with his client's body as a reminder that the family has incriminating information about him. After Mumsy makes sexual overtures to New Friend one evening, he gets the idea to turn the family against itself. "New Friend's" plot succeeds, as he creates sexual jealousy between the women after first sleeping with Mumsy and then Girly. Sonny, left out of the sexual politics, petitions to have New Friend "sent to the angels," resulting in Girly bludgeoning him to death with an antique mirror. Nanny attempts to secure New Friend for herself by murdering Mumsy with acid-tipped needles, but the attempt fails and Girly hacks Nanny to death with an axe and cooks her head for use in baked goods. Rather than turn on one another, Mumsy and Girly declare a truce, deciding to "share" New Friend by alternating what days of the week each woman will be permitted to have sex with him. The two women agree, though ponder what will happen should either of them ever become bored with New Friend, with Mumsy declaring it as an inevitability. Preparing for this day, New Friend settles into Mumsy's room with the acid-tipped needles Nanny had attempted to kill Mumsy with, content to bide his time enjoying the women's company.
