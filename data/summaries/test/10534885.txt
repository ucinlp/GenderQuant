Three older men, wearing hats and smoking cigars, are sitting at a patio. Two of the men are playing cards  at a table while the third man sits watching. As the game continues a  waiter walks across carrying a tray with a bottle of wine and glasses on it. The man sitting at the table then proceeds to pour the drinks while the waiter observes the card game.
