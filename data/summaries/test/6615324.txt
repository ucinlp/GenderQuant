His best friend Jack Hayes  is a self-employed pool cleaner, who gets caught having sex with the wife of Burt Miranda , an organized crime figure. While Jack escapes the initial confrontation with Miranda unharmed, Miranda sends a trio of goons  to break Jack's feet. Jack convinces Pilot to flee and Pilot proposes they go to Seattle without telling him they're going there to see an old fling of Pilot's. The goons catch wind of where the two are headed and set out to hunt down Jack. While at a diner, Jack and Pilot intervene when they discover Cassie  being assaulted in the diner's parking lot. Cassie suggests that she does not know where to go so Jack offers her a lift. On the way to Seattle, they meet Johnny the Fox , an aging stoner who tags along, save Desmond the Alligator Boy from a group of high school bullies, and ultimately end up in Seattle at the memorial for the recently departed Kurt Cobain where Miranda's Pandas finally catch up to Jack and break both of his feet.
