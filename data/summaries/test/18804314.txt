The story of the film is based on two sisters Shabana and Farzana , who have similar faces but different personality traits. Farzana is reserved and dutiful girl, whereas her sister Shabana is a lively, enthusiastic and bubbly type. Shahid played a role of a rich man's spoilt son and a playboy. Waheed Murad played a role of a suspicious husband. The story starts when Shahid trapped Farzana  into a secret wedding, attended only by his closest aides and a dubious maulvi. After having consummated the marriage Shahid informs his stunned bride that her services are no longer required and when she objects, he tosses her out of the apartment window, plunging her towards death. However, she survives and when she returns, her mother and Shabana are horrified to hear her story. Shabana decides to take revenge on Shahid for having deceived her saintly, legless and now pregnant sister. Shahid reels in horror when Shabana returns to the office pretending to be a resurrected Farzana and resumes her duties as secretary. At about the same time, Shahid's younger brother Waheed Murad arrives home and finds his elder brother behaving in an abnormal, flustered manner. Now Shabana's plan kicks into gear and she begins to blackmail Shahid about the attempted murder and begins to make him pay for the cruelty that he inflicted on her . Meanwhile Waheed and Shabana fall in love with each other and both get married. One day, just when Shabana has tortured Shahid sufficiently by singing to him and behaving like a punch-drunk retarded dwarf, Waheed overhears them and assumes that they are having a raging affair and were married before he met her. Finally, in a shattering climax, all is revealed and injustices are addressed.
