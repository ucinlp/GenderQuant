In a live action sequence, a reporter  interviewing Max Fleischer asks him about his latest animated star Betty Boop. Max obligingly draws Betty "out of the inkwell" and asks her to perform a couple of numbers. Song and dance numbers from Stopping the Show, Betty Boop's Bamboo Isle, and The Old Man of the Mountain are used. In the end, Betty jumps back into the inkwell, accidentally splashing ink into the reporter's face.
