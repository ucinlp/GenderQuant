Ladies' man and soon-to-be college graduate Miles is a player who keeps journals to record his "conquests". His friend Cleaver thinks Miles should accept a bet: can Miles sleep with enough girls before he graduates, to complete the alphabet ? Having already conquered a number of girls with different first-letters in their surnames, Miles stands a good chance of being able to succeed. It all boils down to whether he can find and sleep with a girl whose surname starts with an X. Miles' roommate Ben, however will prove to be a problem for Miles, since he has a crush on Gabrielle, Miles' target. At the end of the bet, Cleaver tries to push Miles even harder, since the pot has grown to 30,000 dollars. Miles, however, has fallen for Gabrielle, who is different from every girl he's ever met. They start dating, and Ben becomes more jealous. Ben decides to ruin Miles' chances of sleeping with Gabrielle by telling Gabrielle about the bet, even though Miles has clearly explained that Gabrielle means more to him than the money.
