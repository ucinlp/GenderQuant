To make Daoud Aoulad-Syadâ€™s previous film, En attendant Pasolini, sets were built on plots rented from those living in the village. A mosque was erected on the plot belonging to Moha, one of the neighbors. When they finished shooting, the film crew left the village. The neighbours demolished all of the sets, except for the mosque, which had become a real place of worship for those who live there. However, this is disastrous for Moha, who used to grow vegetables to feed his family on this land.
