Santosh  is a playful young NRI  from London, who returns to India to attend his cousin Lali wedding. There, he meets one of Lalita's friends, Siri  who came from the countryside to attend the marriage. Though they initially clash, after a series of misadventures, they fall in love. Santosh, however, is supposed to marry the spoiled daughter of his uncle's friend. When Siri goes back home, Santosh follows her to win her over — however, Siri's over-protecting brother Krishna  is less than happy. He promises Santosh to give his blessings for the wedding if Santosh manages to produce more harvest than he does. Santosh accepts the challenge and starts learning farming. However, the son of a friend of Krishna is secretly in love with Siri, and his father asks Krishna for Siri's hand in marriage with his son. Krishna doesn't give his consent. With brooding jealousy, the wannabe-fiancé kidnaps Siri after Santosh wins the farming challenge. Santosh chases the kidnapers and kills the wannabe-fiancé. Siri's brother Srihari will take the blame for the murder and go to jail. The couple gets married when Srihari gets released from jail. The movie ends with rejoining of all family members.
