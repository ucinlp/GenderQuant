Faruk Yazıcı  is the idealist governor of the Aegean city of Denizli, where a team of engineers from the Turkish Mining Exploration Institute  have recently discovered reserves of uranium. The governor joins forces with his childhood friend Ömer Uçar , who heads the team of MTA engineers, in a fight against the beautiful and scheming bureaucrat Ceyda Aydın , who actually works to get mines in Turkey under the control of foreign companies. Interestingly, a number of unexplained murders are uncovered only a short while after the governor and the MTA engineers focus on the reserves in Denizli.
