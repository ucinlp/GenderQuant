Set in Cairo, in 1922, the film starts with the archaeologist Danny Freemont  who is desperately trying to enter the tomb of Tutankhamun. It has the last of four pieces of an ancient emerald which is said to possess great occult powers. His rival is the academic Morgan Sinclair , who stole the first three parts of the emerald for the committee of the Hellfire Council, a secret committee of powerful men. They intend to use the tablet in order to maintain and extend their world domination. Freemont has only his determination, his intuition and a band of adventurers, including the brilliant, skeptical Egyptologist Dr. Azelia Barakat  to help him find the last tablet. Shootings, prophecies, kidnappings, murders and betrayals are obstacles to their research. In the film, neither side realises that when the pieces of the emerald are assembled, the coffin will open a portal to Hell, therefore unleashing the demons of the underworld. Among the demons is the terrible Seth, who is able to control the sand, much to his advantage during the immortal fight for good vs. evil. As demons flock the Earth--bringing out the truly terrible side to human beings, who are plagued by hellish nightmares--Freemont is armed with a beautiful archeologist, several close friends, guns, a man who can really use dynamite to the advantage, a portal to Hell, and Tutankhamun's help. But can they all get out alive?
