In the totalitarian near future, 'social deviants' are sent to prison camps for re-education and behaviour modification. The new arrivals at Camp 47 are Chris Walters , a shopkeeper accused of helping a rebel; Rita Daniels , a suspected sex worker; and Paul Anders , a dissident who has escaped from several other camps. After suffering brutal treatment at the hands of Camp Master Charles Thatcher ([[Michael Craig  and his chief enforcer, Ritter ([[Roger Ward , the prisoners accept a deadly deal. They will be human prey in a 'turkey shoot', which Thatcher has organised for Secretary Mallory , and VIPs Jennifer  and Tito . If they can evade the heavily armed guests in the surrounding jungle until sundown, Chris, Rita and Paul will be set free. As the 'turkey shoot' progresses, the tables are turned, and the prisoners become the hunters, culminating in a free for all slaughter terminated by a government napalm airstrike.
