An American agent, Carl Steelman  joins a Nazi spy ring to expose the identities of double agents. He works for the FBI but was born in Germany and speaks fluent German. In Berlin, Steelman meets and falls in love with Helga Lorenz , a member of the German underground. He later has to betray the girl to the Gestapo, to avoid exposing himself. He does, however, later manage to rescue her and see that she arrives in England safely. Steelman is sent on a mission about a U-boat and sent to the United States to attack it. His cover is eventually blown but he successfully escapes off the coast of Long Island and later gives testimony in a court trial, bringing the spies to justice.
