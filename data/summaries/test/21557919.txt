A young man in his haste to go some place takes two actions - he screams at his mother for making him late, and he lovingly appreciates his brother's painting. His mother vents out her anger on her maidservant. Here the 'frustration cycle' starts. The maid, in turn, shouts at her daughter [who upsets her boyfriend by refusing to go for a movie with him]. Meanwhile, the young man's brother gifts the painting to his girl friend, who makes her dad happy. Her dad, in turn, drives the car himself as a b'day present for the driver. The driver, in turn, gets a boy on the street a free bicycle ride. The boy helps an old lady in carrying heavy things. This makes her happy & she urges her granddaughter to flee [elope] with her boyfriend. This is the zenith of the 'happiness cycle' created by the young man. The granddaughter's boyfriend decide to meet somewhere, but on his way, the bf sees a man getting hit by a car. The culprit is the same guy who is at the end of the 'sadness/frustration cycle' also created by the young man . Thus, the cycle of sorrow and joy riding a Domino stairway is brilliantly showcased by the filmmaker in just two shots straight. It is bewildering to see, how, after shaking hands with 15 other characters and traveling through 17 locations, in just two shots, both the cycles meet at the end in an attempt to give a logical understanding to the seemingly absurd human life.
