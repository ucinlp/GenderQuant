Ed Artis, Jim Laws, and Walt Ratterman are former soldiers and modern-day knights. In an Indiana Jones meets Mother Teresa adventure, they travel the world delivering life saving humanitarian aid directly into the hands of civilians and doctors in some of the most dangerous yet beautiful places on Earth, the front lines of war. They are self-styled Knights of Malta. In 1995, they formed Knightsbridge International, a unique humanitarian aid organization, whose motto is "High Adventure and Service to Humanity." Their specialty is going where death from landmines, bullets, or bombs is as frequent as death from hunger, disease, or the elements. Their personal convictions and courage drive them to places such as Afghanistan, Albania, Chechnya, Cambodia, Burma, Thailand, Rwanda, and the southern Philippines, often when few if any other humanitarian aid organizations are around. The camera follows Artis, Laws, and Ratterman as they take us on a journey into the heart of humanity and the soul of courage. Walt Ratterman died afterwards in the 2010 Haiti earthquake.
