A little girl is eating too many snacks when she doesn't realize that it is her bedtime. Then the Sandman comes out of nowhere and, sure enough, the girl falls asleep in the blink of an eye. Just then, she has a dream that she is in Toyland, where she encounters all kinds of fairy tale characters. They sing her a welcome song and then meet a friendly toy soldier for the first time while marching in a Toyland parade. Just then, they open a book called "Beauty and the Beast" and sing the title song from out of the pages, but as soon as they are about to get to the next page, a horrible, monstrous beast is about to take her captive. Sure enough, it's an all-out brawl between the girl and the beast. Even a toy airplane can't soothe the savage beast. When she realizes that it's all a bad dream, she gets scared and jumps back into bed, but when she covers herself with the blanket, the flap of her pajamas hangs out when she goes back to sleep.
