Construction works carried out in a small village in Thuringia reveal the corpse of a member of the Waffen-SS, who seems to have been buried during the end of the Second World War - although no fighting took place in the area. Two forensics experts from the People's Police Investigations Department, Stetter and Hoffmann, arrive in the village to determine the death cause. At first, they suspect the owner of the lands in which the body was discovered; but after questioning him, he is murdered. A golden coin they found leads them to a local woman named Helga, and they reveal the truth behind the matter.
