Georges Clou  is a successful salesman, enjoying the fruits of his labour as a resident of an exclusive gated community in the French Riviera. His life is seemingly idyllic, a beautiful home, a loving wife and a son. Appearances are deceptive as this idyllic vision is spoiled by the traumas his teenage son endures. Elsewhere in the community, Paul Marteau , arrives with a troubled past and uncertain future.Parc, by Arnaud des Palli√®res France in London. 21 October 2008
