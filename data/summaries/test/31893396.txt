Mini is a 10-year old school girl from a middle-class family whose father is a habitual drunkard who beats up his wife as a rule and throws tantrums into the early hours of the morning. The mother and daughter suffer in silence; but the neighbours find the daily antics a nuisance. Despite their vehement protests things go from bad to worse. Mini prays to god and wishes that her father stop drinking and turn over a new life. She goes to the temple but to no avail. She then learns about Gandhiji and his hunger strike. She goes on a hunger strike and when she collapses she is admitted to the hospital. Her father realises his fault and breaks down. He then promises never to touch alcohol again. Mini's non-violent approach brings her victory and joy.
