Police chief Joe Conroy  is relieved of his police duties after he accuses a "respected community man" Al Willis  of murdering a group of police officers. Despite his lack of authority, Conroy puts so much heat on Willis that the latter, making the excuse to his wife Helen  that he needs time to clear his head, skips town for Border City, where he's living a double life as a hoodlum with bar-singer mistress Marianna , whom he treats abusively. Conroy tails Willis to Border City in Mexico, where he recruits Marianna to his scheme to bring Willis to justice. A climactic cat-and-mouse game ends in a rooftop shootout.
