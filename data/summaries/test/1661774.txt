During the war, six members of pilot Ted Stryker's squadron are killed due to a command decision made by him. Years later, in civilian life in Canada, a guilt-stricken Stryker goes through many jobs and his marriage is in trouble. Stryker finds a note at home and rushes to the airport to board a commercial flight. His wife Ellen is on board with young son Joey, leaving him for good. He asks for one last chance, but Ellen explains that she no longer can love a man she does not respect. The flight is routine until stewardess Janet Turner begins the meal service. Meat or fish is the option, but when a number of passengers begin feeling sick, a doctor aboard determines that there must have been something toxic in the fish. While attending to others, including Stryker's son, the stewardess and doctor discover that both the pilot and co-pilot have also become seriously ill. No one is left to fly the plane. Stryker is the only one with experience, but he has not flown for 10 years and has no familiarity with aircraft of this size. Due to dense fog on the ground obscuring the runway, Flight 714 must bypass Calgary and continue on toward Vancouver before it can land. Stryker's superior in the war, Captain Treleaven, is summoned to instruct him how to land the plane. Ellen joins her husband in the cockpit to handle the radio. Ordered to remain airborne, Stryker makes another command decision to bring the airliner down because passengers will die if they do not get to a hospital soon. The plot line served as a basis for the plot line in the 1980 parody film Airplane!.
