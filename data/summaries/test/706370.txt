Abby Barnes  is a veterinarian who hosts a Los Angeles radio show called The Truth About Cats and Dogs. Abby strikes up an unexpected friendship with her neighbor Noelle Slusarsky , a "traditionally attractive" model who is sweet but not very bright. When Abby makes a blind date with a caller to her show, Brian , her insecurity with her own appearance leads her to persuade Noelle to pretend to be Abby when meeting the date. Unfortunately, both women develop feelings for the man, leading to a comedic series of misunderstandings as the unintended consequences of their deception grow deeper. Brian's persistance in pursuing "Abby" is continually thwarted as Noelle alternately eludes him, manoeuvers him toward the real Abby, and  ultimately pursues him herself, only to avoid him again when she reflects on her actions. Abby, disguised as her own fictional assistant, "Donna", hints that it is really she that Brian has intellectually and emotionally connected with over a series of increasingly intimate phone conversations. Brian is convinced that he is having those conversations with Noelle, and fails to consider Abby romantically. Abby accepts this as reinforcement of her negative self-image. Brian, distressed by Noelle's changing attitude, corners "Donna" in Abby's apartment where he finds evidence of Abby's real identity. As Abby and Noelle attempt to explain, Brian becomes convinced that he is the target of a practical joke and leaves in disgust. Days later, Abby approaches Brian at his regular bar and explains what happened, but Brian curtly dismisses her. Weeks later, Brian's dog appears at the radio station with a pair of roller skates and instructions for Abby to put them on. When she does so, the dog drags her to an outdoor park where Brian is waiting for her. He explains that Abby and Noelle's antics had left him confused, but that it was Abby that he had fallen for during their phone conversations, and that the only reason he was attracted to Noelle was because he thought she was Abby. He suggests they start again, and Abby happily agrees.
