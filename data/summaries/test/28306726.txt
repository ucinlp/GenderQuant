In 1940, France is at war with Germany. The French have removed large numbers of troops from their African possessions, leaving the way open for revolt. American soldier of fortune Mike Conway  sees a chance to pay his way back to the United States by gunrunning to hostile Tuaregs. Wearing a slouch hat and bush jacket, Conway is armed with a Thompson sub machine gun and a wristwatch with an alarm engraved "From Conway to Conway". He finds himself walking a razor's edge between an anti-French Tuareg leader  keen for Conway's supply of weapons but keener to use his tarantulas on his prisoners, a moderate Imam  wanting peace, the local French Foreign Legion commander , and the commander's attractive wife  who Conway cannot keep away from.
