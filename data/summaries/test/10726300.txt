Thakur Bhupendra Singh  and his son Ajit  are landlords, presiding oppressively over a small Indian community. Ajit gets Laxmi  pregnant and casts her aside. Her brother Bheema  goes to plead with them to accept Laxmi as their daughter-in-law and they reject his pleas and have him thrown out. Bheema tries to avenge this humiliation, only to have his sister killed. Bheema is imprisoned, and after his sentence is over he returns to his community, only to be told that he can no longer reside there, as the entire community is terrified of the Thakur and his men. Bheema then decides to move out of town. Some villagers and a police officer  persuade Bheema to return, and he agrees. On his return, Bheema's nephew Kanhaiya  is abducted by Thakur and his men, and he will only be returned after Bheema obtains signatures/thumb prints from everyone in the community, thereby turning over their properties to Thakur's name. Will Bheema compromise the safety of his nephew, and will he able to persuade the community to bow down to Thakur's demands?
