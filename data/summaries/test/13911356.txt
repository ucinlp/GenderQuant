The film questions the theme of land and Agrarian Reform in Brazil, and depicts the landowners known as "coron√©is" in Portuguese as brutal and vindictive men. A lot of money, equipment and resources were employed for the film as it was considered an important topic at the time. Much of the film however has been destroyed and only fragments remain.
