Arush Mehra  lives a fairly wealthy lifestyle in Sydney, Australia with roommates Tanmay Joglekar  and Ali Haider . He works for a popular dance club, while Tanmay entertains children as 'Eddy Teddy' and Ali takes care of their apartment. All three are womanizers and usually end up sleeping with different women. One day, they find a baby girl outside their door with a note instructing them to take care of her, since she is the daughter of one of them. The three men go to all the women they dated and slept with, but none claim that this baby is hers. The men try to take care of Angel, but she becomes a huge pain, so they drop her off at a church. A big rainstorm occurs, and the baby develops an illness after being caught in the rain. The three men stay with Angel in the hospital, realizing how much they love her. She recovers, and the guys become changed men. They love her, pamper her, and grow a huge attachment towards her. One day, a woman named Isha  comes to take Angel back, claiming the baby to be her daughter. The guys are shocked as Arush tells them about his past. One year ago, Arush traveled to Delhi to attend his cousin Arjun's wedding. There, he met Isha Sahni, who also resides in Australia. He won her over and they spent night with each other. Shortly after, Isha caught him in a compromising situation with Devika Sharma , Isha's friend, so the couple split up. Arush returned to Sydney and forgot about the incident. The guys find it very difficult to live without Angel. Arush ends up challenging Isha to marry someone faithful within seven days who will accept Angel: If she's unsuccessful, she will have to give Angel back to him. They sign a contract to make the deal final. The men worry that they might lose the bet since Isha is very beautiful and wealthy. Arush makes a plan to win Isha and Angel back with the help of Ali, Tanmay and Isha's father. His attempts fail and Isha decides not to marry him. On the same day, Tanmay/Eddy Teddy meets her at the fair. After seeing his affection towards kids, Isha decides he will be good for Angel and her. A few days later, Isha finds out the truth and plans to fly with Angel on her private jet, since she was fooled and has lost the deal. Tanmay and Ali take the contract with them, as well as phoning the police. Just as the police are about to take Angel away from Isha, Arush tears up the contract and allows Isha and Angel to go. While they are parting, Angel says her first word: "Dada". Arush, Tanmay and Ali are upset until their bell rings the next day. They are amazed to find Angel at their doorstep. A few moments later, Isha turns up, telling Arush that it was very hard for them both to forget him. She agrees to marry him and the three are reunited.
