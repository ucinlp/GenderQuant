Upon release from prison, gangster Eddie Kagle  is killed by his partner in crime, Smiley Williams . Kagle ends up in Hell, where "Nick"  offers him a chance to get out of hell and get revenge in exchange for help with a problem. He looks exactly like Judge Frederick Parker, an upright man who is entirely too honest and liable to cause more trouble in future, since he is running for governor of his state. Kagle readily agrees. Nick arranges to have Kagle take over Parker's body. Then, funny things start happening. Kagle pursues his goal with evil intent , but everything he does to smear the judge's reputation somehow ends up making Parker look better. Along the way, Kagle becomes acquainted with Barbara Foster , the judge's fianc√©e. He falls in love with her himself, causing him to question his whole outlook on life. Finally, he rebels. Kagle is offered the opportunity to shoot Williams but instead confronts the man with the truth. Shocked and frightened, Williams backs away and accidentally falls out an open window to his death. Exasperated and defeated, Nick takes Kagle back to Hell, leaving Judge Parker much better off than before. Nick threatens to make the reformed man's existence even more painful than usual, but Kagle blackmails his would-be tormentor; in return for not talking about how Nick messed up so badly, Kagle gets himself made a trustee.
