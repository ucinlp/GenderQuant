Two guys have the winning ticket in a lottery, but the ticket is taken by a woman robbing the restaurant they're in, who swallows the ticket before getting arrested. The guys come up with a scheme to recover the ticket by committing a felony while impersonating women so as to be sent to the same women's penitentiary as the robber.
