The film opens up in J.S Medical College, Pune, where the principal calls Dr. Rohan Verma  and tells him that he has received a gold medal, a bungalow, a car and a chief surgeon post in Bombay. Verma and his wife Suman , a school teacher, both reach their new house in Bombay. One year later, while they are asleep, they hear a voice. Verma starts searching the house when suddenly a burglar  attacks him. Suman starts calling the police, but the burglar escapes. Two policemen, Inspector Indrajeet Saxena aka Inder  and Inspector Sule  arrive to investigate and tells them to file a report. While in school, a peon fraudulently puts drugs in Suman's handbag. Inspector Sule tells her that she has to be arrested in drugs case, but inspector Inder informs her that she is free to go as the drugs were put by the peon and he has confessed. The peon is shown dead on the floor with blood on his face. On the other hand, Dr. Verma invites Inspector Inder to their home for dinner. Inder arrives with Soley. While they are partying, Inder starts asking them about children to which both get depressed. Next day, Inder invites Verma to a men-only party. After the party, Inder takes Verma to an area where only criminals live. He goes inside and brings a man - the same person who came as a burglar in Verma's house. Inder asks Verma to take his revenge but Verma refuses and says that he cannot take the life of any person. To this, Inder frees the burglar but shoots him while he is escaping. Verma reaches home and tells his wife that Inder is a psycho and that she should maintain a distance from him. To this Suman tells him that whatever Inder did was right. The next day, Inder meets Suman and justifies his actions saying that the burglar deserved this punishment. Inder then arrives at a party, given in honour of Dr. Verma. Verma tells him to leave but he refuses. Inder is in reality lusting on Verma's wife Suman and is trying every possible way to attract her towards him. Next day, Inder meets Suman and asks her the reason for not having a child. Suman tells him that two years earlier, while she was pregnant, she fell off from the stairs. Dr. Verma was busy in an emergency duty and could not come to the hospital to see her and she lost the child. She regrets that if Verma had come that day, they would not have lost the child. The next night, Inder calls a prostitute  to his house and tells her to behave like Suman. But when she calls him Raja, Inder beats her black and blue and tells her that you are not Suman and the day will come when Suman will fall for him. Inder's friend Inspector Sule warns him to stop interfering in the life of Dr. Verma and Suman and that if he continues to do that, he will report this matter to the ACP. Inder ignores the warning and disconnects the telephone and electricity connection of Verma's house. At night, he enters Verma's house where Rohan and Suman are having sex. While finding Inder at such an uninviting position at his house, Rohan gets furious and along with his lawyer  goes to the ACP to lodge a complaint against Inder. Inder then kills the prostitute and his friend Sule and tells the ACP that both of them were involved in dealing of drugs which were supplied by Dr. Verma. He then tricks Verma into the drugs case and gets him arrested. At night, Inder reaches Verma's house. He first kills Suman's friend Neeta  and then goes after Suman. On the other hand, Verma tricks the police and escape from their custody. Upon reaching his house, he engages in a fierce battle with Inder. In the end, Dr. Verma kills Inder in an act of self defence.
