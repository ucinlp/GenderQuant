Set in 1984 in a small Texas town, Cherry Bomb follows the story of Cherry, an exotic dancer who is attacked by a group of men in the club where she works. Upon waking in the hospital, Cherry soon comes to find that all of the men have escaped justice, seemingly due to the help of corrupt local law enforcement. Against all odds, Cherry teams up with her estranged brother and vows revenge against the men who left her emotionally and physically broken. But things don't always go as planned, and Cherry finds herself up against the police, a vicious hired gun, and a barrage of unexpected consequences as she strives for vengeance.
