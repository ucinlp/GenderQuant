Exchanging clothes with a group of mischievous orphans, the Our gang ends up on a train headed for Chicago. Pressed into service as the kids' supervisor, effeminate Travelers Aid attendant Mr. Henderson  suffers torment, especially when he tries to prevent three-year old Spanky from socking the nose of every adult in sight. Things come to a head when the kids manage to get hold of some fireworks, at the same time accidentally releasing a menagerie of circus animals from the baggage car. At the end of the episode, Mr. Henderson is told he has the wrong children and must bring them back on a train to California.
