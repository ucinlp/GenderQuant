Marty  is a struggling writer who dreams of finishing his screenplay, "Seven Psychopaths". All he needs is a little focus and inspiration. Billy  is Marty's best friend, an unemployed actor and part-time dog thief, who wants to help Marty by any means necessary. Hans  is Billy's partner in crime: a religious man with a violent past. Charlie  is the gangster whose beloved dog Billy and Hans have just stolen. Charlie is unpredictable and extremely violent and wouldn't think twice about killing anyone or destroying anything associated with the theft. Marty is going to get all the focus and inspiration he needs, just as long as he lives to tell the tale.
