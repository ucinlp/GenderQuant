As Powerhouse plays in the background , Marvin the Martian  is traveling to Earth. Upon landing, he opens his assignment envelope - return one Earth creature back to Mars . With the help of his martian dog, K-9 , he finds Bugs' rabbit hole. As the two observe the hole, they are pushed back when Bugs cleans out a bucket of carrot stems. Seeing their getup, Bugs assumes it must be Halloween, so he hands them each a bag of treats. Marvin then decides that he'll have to use force. He pulls out his disintegrating gun and atomizes a large hole where the small rabbit hole used to be. Bugs shrieks "How Halloween-y can you get?" before seeing the flying saucer. Marvin then tells Bugs that he's to come back to Mars with him. Bugs tries to act defiant, but goes slightly insane when Marvin uses his pistol against a nearby rock . He quickly gets some bags and runs into the ship, then runs back out as a train conductor, telling Marvin and K-9 "Flying saucer, leaving for Saturn, Neptune, Jupiter, Venus, the Dogstar and Mars. All aboard!" Marvin and K-9 rush on the ship and fly off, then realize their mistake in midflight and fly back . Bugs convinces Marvin that he wants to go to Mars, but he doesn't want to get involved in a mutiny . Marvin calls K-9 over and atomizes him, but K-9 pulls himself out of his helmet, asking what he did wrong . Bugs starts walking off, but Marvin and K-9 shoot him with an Acme Straight-jacket ejecting bazooka, tying Bugs up. On the ship, Marvin is piloting while K-9 watches over Bugs . Bugs convinces K-9 to let him 'try on something more sporty - maybe in a size 36'. Now out of the straight-jacket, Bugs quickly ties K-9 up, then grabs another jacket and yells that the ship has struck an iceberg, quickly tying up Marvin as well . Now with both of them tied up , Bugs tries turning the ship back home. After a brief out-of-control spin, he starts to fly back, but throws out an anchor to steady the ship. The anchor then pulls on a crescent moon, which in turn pulls on Saturn's rings, a large planet  and other assorted stars. Back on Earth, a small man in an observatory looks into his telescope, only to see the spaceship and the planets directly in front of him. The man then writes a note ("I resign! When I begin to see things like this, it's time to take up turkey farming." Signed, I. Frisby  and leaves. Outside, Bugs asks the man if he knows where he can sell a "slightly used flying saucer &mdash; it's only got 3 billion miles on it." The man then starts making spastic movements and walking off, causing Bugs to ask the audience,:"Huh, what's biting him?"
