Having come home after half of his squadron was killed during the Vietnam War, Sergeant Jack Stryker , given an honorable discharge due to his injuries, attempts to get his life back together. Finding himself reunited with an old girlfriend, Sally  and his war buddies, he feels he may have successfully re-established his life. However, this happiness is quickly cut short when a murderous cult led by an enigmatic but unnamed Charles Manson-like figure, portrayed by director and writer Sam Raimi, comes into town to continue their rampage. After Sally is tortured and Stryker and his compatriots find the cult torturing police officers near his house, they arm themselves up and decide to, as the trailer puts it, "break the laws of both God  and man" and fight back. What follows is a war between the two groups, ending in numerous deaths, including the cult leader's; the exchange between Raimi and Schulz is as follows: Cult Leader: "I am Jesus Christ!" Stryker: "No, you're not &mdash; You're dead." Upon which Stryker shoots Raimi&#39;s character in the chest, and he careens into a river, eventually being impaled on a motorcycle, and their brutal war is ended.
