The silent film, except for narration throughout by Gordon-Levitt, follows the first date between Morgan M. Morgansen  and a young woman named Destiny . Backed up by a sour-turned-sentimental waiter - or the "foodpenguin"  - and a band of cartoon feline musicians , Morgan ultimately manages to woo Destiny. After meeting with Destiny at a restaurant and ordering a cooked rabbit, Morgan discovers Destiny's vegetarianism, and decides to eat only the vegetables around the plate rather than eat the rabbit meat and appall his alarmed date. Appreciative of Morgan's sacrifice at dinner for the sake of her comfort, Destiny begins to kiss him in the street, overlooked by the approving foodpenguin. The two rush off to Morgan's abode and it is stated that Morgan, lying in bed that night, needed no longer feel alone.
