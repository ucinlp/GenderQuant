J.D.  is a trucker from California. When he returns to his home he learns that an old friend of his was wasted by Sergeant Strode , a local policeman in a little town called "Texas City". He starts making inquiries about "Texas City", a revived but still dilapitated former ghost town, which has recently received town ordinances and privileges. Word is, "Texas City" has already a tradition of trapping truckers. Its policemen work the roads like modern robber-knights, led by a hypocritic drunkard who calls himself a judge. When his younger brother Billy  goes about his first solo run J.D. warns him to stay away from this town. But the unexperienced greenhorn is easily lured into a trap when a policeman from “Texas City” uses CB technology to pretend he was a trucker who just wants to help him. Billy is told he should avoid speed traps by choosing a different route which allegedly provides “a clean run”. Once Billy has left the main road he is game. “Texas City” police stops him and makes him believe he had to change his route again because of an accident. Thus he enters the territory of the greedy, corrupt “judge” Trimmings who rips him off by using threadbare pretences and arrests him. After Billy Dawes has vanished, his older brother, J.D. sets out in search of him. He goes to “Texas City” where he witnesses a city council meeting where Trimmings' stooges boast about their booties. Trimmings outlaws him and J.D. has to fight his way out. Even so, he has already befriended the waitress in the local diner. The single mother provides a refuge and J.D. shows he is an able step-father. Soon he takes a new approach and gets into fight with the owner of the local wrecking yard. He is blindsided, knocked out and thrown into a junk press. Still groggy he has to fight for dear life. Climbing out of the started press he kicks the yard owner who stumbles about his junk and hits the ground while falling down backwards. J.D., shocked by this accident, is arrested and sentenced to death by Trimmings. J.D.'s trucker friends hear about it by J.D.'s girl-friend who can access a CB radio station. They come to rescue him and simply tear the town down. J.D. can continue the search for his brother but he is hit by a stray bullet. He runs into Sergeant Strode while Strode is mistreating little Billy. Time has come for the final showdown between J.D. and the scourge of his friends, the evil Sergeant Strode.
