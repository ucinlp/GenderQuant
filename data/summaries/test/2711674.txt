Magnolia Hawks is an eighteen-year-old on her family's show boat, the Cotton Palace  which travels the Mississippi River putting on shows. She meets Gaylord Ravenal, a charming gambler, falls in love with him, and eventually marries him. Together with their baby daughter, the couple leaves the boat and moves to Chicago, where they live off Gaylord's gambling winnings. After about ten years, he experiences an especially bad losing streak and leaves Magnolia, out of a sense of guilt that he is ruining her life because of his losses. Magnolia is forced to bring up her young daughter alone, but is reunited with the repentant Ravenal after twenty-three years. In a parallel plot, Julie LaVerne  is forced to leave the boat because of her background, taking Steve Baker  with her. Julie is eventually also abandoned by her husband, and she consequently becomes an alcoholic, from which she presumably never recovers. Her husband, Steve, also presumably never returns to her. But Julie, who was Magnolia's best friend during their days on the show boat, secretly enables her to become a success on the stage in Chicago after Ravenal has abandoned Magnolia. In the film's most significant change from the show, Magnolia and Ravenal are reunited at the theatre in which Kim, their daughter, is appearing in her first Broadway starring role, rather than back on the show boat, as in the stage production and the other film versions. The final sequence, however, does retain reprises of the songs "You Are Love" and "Ol' Man River".
