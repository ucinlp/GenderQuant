During the prohibition period, Laurel and Hardy make plans to spend a wild night out at the Rainbow Club. Phoning Stan at home, Ollie suggests a ruse by which Stan is to convince his wife, who keeps him on a short leash, that he has been called away on business. Stan readily agrees to the idea, assuring Ollie that his wife is "so dumb she'll never know the difference". Mrs. Laurel, eavesdropping on another line, is furious, but continues listening as Stan tells Ollie that he knows where he can get some liquor. His plan is to steal the bottle that his wife has hidden in the house, and later blame the loss on the ice man. Mrs. Laurel immediately launches a scheme of her own: she replaces the alcohol with a non-alcoholic mixture. Stan and Ollie proceed to get "drunk" at the nightclub, having a wonderful time. That is, until an angry Mrs. Laurel turns up armed with a shotgun, reveals that their "liquor" is merely cold tea, chases them into the street, and demolishes their cab with one well-aimed shot.
