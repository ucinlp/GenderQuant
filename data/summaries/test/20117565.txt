"Unca" Lou Handler , the beloved camp director and owner of Camp Tamakwa, invites eight former campers, all now adults, back to the camp to announce his retirement. Lou claims to have chosen these friends as they were the group from the camp's "golden years" 20 years previously. Once there, the group comes to feel nostalgic memories of their youth and the unresolved feelings for each other begin to surface.
