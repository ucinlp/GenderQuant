Child psychologist Samuel Faulkner's  ideal romance with ballet teacher Rebecca Taylor  is turned upside-down when Rebecca gets pregnant. His fears mount due to his encounters with overbearing couple Marty ([[Tom Arnold  & Gail  and their unruly daughters, as well as the confusing advice he gets from his perpetually single artist friend . Too uninvolved with Rebecca's needs, Samuel parts company with her and takes a last stab at playing the field, but when he sees an ultrasound of his soon-to-be-born son, he decides that it's time to take responsibility before it's too late. Robin Williams, as Rebecca's Russian OB-GYN, adds much of the comic relief in the film.
