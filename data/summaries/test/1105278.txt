Sean and Anna  are a married couple living in New York City. While scenes of Central Park are shown onscreen, Sean is heard lecturing to an unseen audience, explaining that he does not believe in reincarnation. After the lecture he goes jogging, collapses and dies. Ten years later, Anna has accepted a marriage proposal from her boyfriend, Joseph . When Clifford , Sean's brother, arrives at Anna's engagement party, his wife Clara  excuses herself, saying she forgot to wrap Anna's gift. Instead, she buys a replacement after hurriedly burying the gift while a young boy  secretly looks on. At a party for Anna's mother , the boy who followed Clara claims to be Anna's deceased husband, Sean, and warns her not to marry Joseph. At first Anna dismisses the boy's claim. When Anna receives a letter from him the next day warning her not to marry Joseph, she realizes the boy truly believes he is her reincarnated husband. That night Anna and Joseph discuss the letter. Since the building watchman seems to know the boy , Joseph calls to get more information. When Sean answers the phone, Joseph rushes downstairs to confront him. He takes him to Sean's father , and the three of them order Sean to leave Anna alone. Sean refuses to recant his story, and Anna watches Sean collapse in his father's arms. Sean leaves a message on Anna's answering machine, which her mother overhears. That day at lunch, Anna's mother mentions that Sean wants to meet Anna in the park, and that she will know where. Anna hurries to Central Park and finds Sean waiting in the spot where her husband died. He offers to submit to questioning. Anna's brother-in-law Bob , a doctor, talks to Sean, recording his responses on tape. He answers all the questions, even giving intimate details of Anna and Sean's sex life. Sean is brought to Anna's by his mother , and he is able to identify parts of the apartment. Everyone except Anna remains doubtful. Anna's family becomes worried, particularly her sister Laura , who treats Sean with contempt. When Anna misses an appointment with her fiance to spend time with Sean, Joseph begins feeling worried not merely about the boy, but about Anna's odd behavior. His jealousy is made plain when he physically attacks Sean. When Sean runs out, Anna follows him and kisses him on the lips. Anna seems convinced by the boy's story and asks Clara and Clifford to meet him. Clara encounters Sean at the door and asks him to visit her later. When he visits, he brings a backpack full of Anna's love letters to Sean. These were Clara's spiteful engagement gift which the boy secretly unearthed and read the night of the party. We learn that Clara was Sean's lover before his death, and that he gave the letters to her unopened as proof of his love. Clara was jealous that Sean would not leave Anna, but abandoned her plan to give Anna the letters. When Clara points out that if he were really a reincarnation of Sean he would have come to her first, Sean runs out, confused. When Anna finds Sean, she suggests they run away and marry when he is of legal age. He tells Anna that since he loves her he must not be the reincarnated Sean. Anna apologizes to Joseph, and they are married at the beach. Sean wrote a long letter apologizing to Anna, wondering why he had the delusion of being her husband. Anna wades into the sea in anguish after the ceremony. Joseph gradually pulls her back onto the sand and whispers into her ear.
