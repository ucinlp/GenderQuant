The story combines the literary world of Miguel de Cervantes with a 21st century satire. An advertising executive, who finds himself unstuck in time, unwittingly travels between modern day London and 17th century La Mancha, where he participates in the adventures of Don Quixote, who mistakes him for Sancho Panza.
