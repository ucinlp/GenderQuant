Set in 2017, TV news-magazine host David Potrero  looks back at the major changes in America and the rest of 153 allied nations after the implementation of the 40 Point Plan five years earlier. Throughout the movie, various  newscasters "read into reality" stories that reveal an alternative world enjoying the effects of plan. While set in the future, attention to real names makes the plan seem entirely possible. At the core of the plan is the 2012 formation National Employment Corporation of America, led by a who's who of famous celebrity billionaires--the dream team of executives. NECA solves the unemployment problem by hiring millions of American workers to use an expanded version of real technological advances to build housing, provide water, grow food and sell its many American made products in its own superstores throughout the country and around the world. What separates NECA from your average corporation is what it does with the distribution of its profits. One third of the profits go to the organization's charitable efforts, particularly the health care system. Essentially this is a complete alternative to the contemporary partisan political battles dividing America, providing real solutions that avoid the arguing. Many of the social ills affecting society are solved, not by the government, but by private enterprise.http://www.campcampaign.com/could-the-40-point-plan-work-in-the-real-world/ The story is brought to life by interviews with people affected by NECA's development, including a NECA executive, Dr. Kelly Rivers , a doctor in the medical program, Dr. Joe DelGado , a food skytower owner Nathan Kuthbert  and a formerly homeless "success story" Valerie Sinclair .
