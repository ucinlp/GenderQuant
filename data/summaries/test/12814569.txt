As John Allen, a condemned murderer, is led to the electric chair, a witness asks a guard how long it takes for the condemned person to die. "Two seconds," the guard answers, "the longest two seconds of his life." As the executioner throws the switch, the events that led up to the execution appear in flashback. Allen worked with his friend and flatmate Bud Clark as a riveter high on the girders of a skyscraper under construction. Bud is engaged to be married, and tries to set up a date for Allen, but Allen is uninterested. He goes to a dance hall, where he meets dancer Shirley Day. He defends her from an amorous patron, and she is fired by Tony, the proprietor who is also her lover. Allen wants to be with an educated woman, and Shirley pretends to be interested in attending a lecture with him. Instead, she persuades him to go to a speakeasy and she gets him drunk on "tea". She bribes a justice of the peace to marry them; Allen is too drunk to realize what is happening. When they return to Allen's apartment, Shirley throws Bud out. Almost immediately, Shirley begins seeing Tony. When, three weeks after the marriage, Bud tells Allen that Shirley is unfaithful they fight, and Bud falls to his death from a skyscraper girder. The grief-stricken Allen then quits his job, but is demoralized by living on Shirley's ill-gotten money. Later Shirley pretends to repent and tells Allen that she has been meeting with Tony to borrow money to help Bud's fiancee Annie get a job at the dance hall. Allen begins betting on horses in order to pay off the debts Shirley owes Tony. One of his bets pays off $362 and Allen heads to Tony's house with the money, only to find Shirley in Tony's arms. He realizes that Bud had been telling the truth, and Shirley had been lying to him. Jealous, he kills Shirley and is sentenced to the electric chair. At his trial Allen refuses all defenses saying he should have been killed when he was at his lowest, not when he had been avenged. As the switch is pulled, Allen reflects on how he got away with Bud Clark's accidental death, but was condemned for Shirley's murder.
