A wealthy real estate investor receives a film showing the rape and murder of his girlfriend. He hires a private detective, and shows him the film-- which he criticizes for its poor cinematography-- so that the detective can find the criminals and bring them to justice. The detective discovers that the woman is not dead, but doesn't inform his employer because the detective has romantic intentions towards her as well. His search leads him to a warehouse in the wastelands, filled with flies and sex dolls modeled on the woman. A gunshot is heard and the detective is engaged in target practice in the desert with the realtor. The realtor says he has a case he would like to be investigated, which returns the film to the first scene.<ref nameWeisser|firstYuko Mihara Weisser|title1998|publisherMiami|isbn 210â€“211|chapter= INFLATABLE SEX DOLL OF THE WASTELANDS }}
