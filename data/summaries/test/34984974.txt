The Grandchildren’s Mother is one of the countless stories about AIDS in Mozambique and how it inexorably tears families apart, causing the parents’ death and leaving the elderly to care for the children. A combination of animation and documentary, this film narrates the story of Granny Elisa, whose son and eight wives died, leaving her to care for 14 children.
