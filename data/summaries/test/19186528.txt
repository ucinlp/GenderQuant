After missing his morning train to work, the Pink Panther realizes he needs something heavy duty to help him wake up in the morning. He decides to purchase a cuckoo clock, which contains a live cuckoo bent on getting the stubborn feline out of bed. Eventually, the Pink Pather tires of the cuckoo's relentless efforts, and promptly dumps the clock into the local river.  That evening, the panther's guilty conscience gets the better of him. Fearing the little cuckoo is drowning alive, he rushes back to the river, with hopes of undoing the damage. He fails to find the cuckoo and his clock, and mopes his way home, unaware that the cuckoo has already crawled out of the river and placed himself on the panther's wall. Upon arriving home, the Pink Panther is so overcome with joy at the cuckoo's reappearance that he lets the little fellow snuggle in bed with himâ€”and help disengage the blaring alarm clocks as well.
