Ryotaro pursues the Molech Imagin to May 8, 2000. Though Den-O Sword Form destroys the Molech Imagin, the Imagin fulfilled his mission as the DenLiner ends up hijacked by the rest of the Imagin led by a rogue Kamen Rider named Gaoh who knocks Ryotaro out. After stealing Owner's Master Pass and trapping Urataros and Kintaros, Gaoh forces the DenLiner to travel back in time to the Edo Period of Japan so he can retrieve the legendary GaohLiner. Trapped in 2000, with Ryotaro having lost all memory of Den-O, he and Hana encounter Ryotaro's younger self as well as their old friend, the Imagin Sieg as Momotaros arrives, able to only possess the younger Ryotaro while Sieg's special talents allow him to still possess Ryotaro. Yuto shows up, taking everyone on the ZeroLiner to pursue Gaoh, with Kotaro joining them. After being sent into the Mesozoic period by Gaoh, the gang arrived in the Edo Era and gets Senhime's aid in sneaking into the camp of Yukimura Sanada, who is aiding Gaoh. Though the reunited Tar≈çs defeat Sanada's ninjas, Gaoh succeeds in obtaining the GaohLiner and travels forward to December 26, 1988, the day Ryotaro was born, to make an example out of Ryotaro. Though he managed to regain his memory, Ryotaro and Momotaros are forced to fight him and his band on their own until Yuto arrives with the past Ryotaros he borrowed for the "Climax Scene". After the long battle, the Den-O's and Zeronos emerge victorious as the GoahLiner is destroyed by the DenLiner and ZeroLiner and Gaoh is killed by Sword Form, reducing him to sand. On the return trip to his own time, the DenLiner comes across Ryotaro's old house as Ryotaro finally gets to see the faces of his parents. Sieg and Kotaro also return to their respective timelines as well, resuming their places in history. When Ryotaro returns to the present, he finds a drawing of his parents in the picture frame where the original photo once was.<ref namehttp://tvarc.toei.co.jp/tv/den-o/index.asp?action81|title2007-05-27}} {{ja icon}}{{cite web}} {{ja icon}}
