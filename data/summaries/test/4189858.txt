A Boston couple, Gail  and Tom  are having marital problems, due to Tom's inability to spend time with his family because of his work as an architect. Gail, a rafting expert, decides to take their son Roarke  on a holiday rafting trip down the Salmon River in Idaho, along with their pet dog. Their daughter Willa  accompanies them to Gail's parents' house in Idaho. At the last minute, just when they are about to leave for the almost week-long trip, Tom joins them. As they are setting off, they meet a couple of other rafters, Wade  and Terry , who appear to be friendly. Thus Gail, Tom, and Roarke leave for the trip, leaving Willa behind to be taken care of by her grandparents. After a day's rafting, the family make camp for the night, but Tom continues to work on his renderings rather than entering fully into the experience. This agitates Roarke, who thinks that his father does not really seem to realize he is away from home. They are joined by Wade and Terry who help to celebrate Roarke's birthday the same night. Gail slowly becomes friendly with Wade. However, after a while he begins acting suspicious and she decides it would be best to part ways. During the morning's rafting, he reveals to Roarke that they have a gun with them. As they raft down the river his parents discuss an exit strategy that will allow them to leave the two men behind, and at lunch they attempt to leave on their raft and get away before Wade and Terry realize what is going on. Their attempt fails and Wade pulls the gun on them and assaults Tom. Gail then realizes that an armed robbery she had heard about was actually carried out by Wade and Terry, and their rafting trip is actually a way for them to get away. They are forced to raft at gunpoint down the rest of the river before they all set up camp for the night. Meanwhile, a park ranger named Johnny , who knows Gail, is white water canoeing down the river. He bumps into the group; but Wade holds the gun to Gail's back and pretends that everything is okay. Later, he appears again but this time Wade shoots him, grabs him by his shirt, and throws him into the rapids. It is revealed that Wade and Terry, in order to aid their escape, want to go on down the river to a set of rapids where in recent years one person was killed and another was left paralyzed. Consequently, rafting is no longer allowed there. They force Gail to raft down through the rapids despite her repeated attempts to flip the raft and so force them out of the river. During the night Tom attempts to steal the gun off the sleeping Terry but is heard and has to run into the bushes and to the river. Wade gives chase and believes he has shot him when he hears a loud splash into the water. Tom reappears and manages to flip the raft. Gail and Roarke, who have been tied to the raft by Wade, remain in it and manage to get hold of the gun, which had fallen into the water, while Tom is fighting Terry. The struggle ends when Gail throws the bag of money into the water and shoots Wade whose dead body floats off down the river. The film ends with the family and Terry  being helicoptered out.
