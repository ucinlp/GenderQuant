The plot, inspired by real life events that took place in the late 1920s, tells a story about a group of Belgrade football players, their lives, friendships, romances and troubles that arise before their eventual assembly into the national team and departure for the far-away Uruguay. This historical melodrama gives a unique and somewhat nostalgic view of post-Great War Belgrade while resurrecting a distinctive era which underlines the main values and virtues of the time.
