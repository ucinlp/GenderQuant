Krazy is at the second deck of his home, practicing his animated musical instruments, particularly a double bass. Still learning how to play, Krazy's performance was less than promising. Thus the other instruments at his back started jeering at him. When the cat continues playing, the double bass, not liking his music, grabs his bow and shoves him off. Krazy then picks up another one, and the two engaged in a bow fight. This duel ends with the feline tossing the big violin out the window. Krazy went on to discard his other instruments in a similar fashion for their disloyalty. Down on the pavement outside, the double bass tells the cat that they will return in a larger number and get back at him. To build up his battalion, the double bass and his associates paraded on the street, calling for other instruments to joined them. For every house they pass by, at least one comes out to go with the pack. In such a short period, a considerable number was reached, and they were ready to take on their feline foe. The army of musical instruments arrived at the vicinity of Krazy's place, and began firing their guns at the house. Despite the significant odds against him, Krazy takes a machine gun, and was able to shoot down much of the outside forces. Although they suffered numerous casualties, the instruments refuse to concede. They continued their gunfire until Krazy's house begins to crumble, but the feline is, nonetheless, unscathed. Closing in on the cat, one of the incoming attackers went for the coup de grace, only to receive a backfire. Instead of landing on Krazy, the projectile pierces a barrel of whiskey, causing it to spray its contents onto the last instruments still on the offensive. As a conclusion to the battle, the instruments were intoxicated, and they play a blues tune before finally succumbing. Krazy remains on his feet and therefore gets the last laugh.
