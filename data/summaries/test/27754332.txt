Ten-year-old Sammy  lives in Port Said, Egypt, with his parents. When they are killed in a bombing during the Suez Crisis, the boy flees the city in the ensuing panic. He sets out to reach his only living relative, an aunt who lives 5000 miles to the south in Durban, South Africaâ€”at the other end of the continent and in a different hemisphere. Along his journey Sammy encounters a colourful array of characters. His first "guide" is an Arab peddler who dies in a freak accident. Sammy is then "rescued" by wealthy tourist Gloria van Imhoff . When she wants to return him to Port Said, Sammy runs off and encounters a crusty old hunter/diamond smuggler, Cocky Wainwright , whose life is subsequently saved by the boy. When the police search for Sammy, they arrest the old man, who has been a fugitive for years. After Sammy is finally united with his Aunt Jane , he learns that the old smuggler left him his entire fortune. As Cocky Wainwright, Edward G. Robinson gave "one of the subtlest performances of his later career."Julian Upton, Movimail Catalogue, July 2010, p.13 Chosen for 1963's Royal Film PerformanceMoviemail Film Catalogue, July 2010 and nominated for a BAFTA Film Award for best British cinematography in 1964, the film had a difficult production period; Robinson suffered a heart attack and cast members were bitten by snakes.Mark Duguid "Sammy Going South ", BFI screenonline
