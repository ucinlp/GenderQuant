The didactic film is built around the ideas of French physician, writer and philosopher Henri Laborit, who plays himself in the film. It uses the stories of three people to illustrate Laborit's theories on evolutionary psychology regarding the relationship of self and society. Ren√©  leaves the family farm to become an executive at a French textile firm. Janine  leaves her proletarian family behind to become an actress who becomes involved with Jean , a well-educated bourgeois writer/politician. All three characters face difficult choices in life-changing situations that are designed to illuminate Laborit's ideas.
