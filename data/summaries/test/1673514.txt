Later, Claude gets a letter from Melvin stating that the appeal has been denied and Daisy has left Claude for Melvin. Left with no chance of being released, Claude partners with Ray, who claims to have an escape plan. Ray and Claude make several attempts to escape the prison. Early in their incarceration, they simply try running away in the middle of the night, getting as far as Tallahatchie before being tracked down; they are sentenced to a week in solitary confinement for their effort. Around 1944, during World War II, they meet a mute inmate named 'Can't-Get-Right'  who happens to be a talented baseball player. He catches the eye of a Negro League scout who indicates he can get him out of prison to play baseball. Seeing this as a golden opportunity to get out of prison, Ray and Claude tell the scout to put a word in for them as well . A month before his release, a homosexual inmate, Biscuit , commits suicide by deliberately running past the 'gun line', compelling a rifle-armed trustee to shoot him, as he feared returning home to his family a gay man. After 'Can't-Get-Right' is released to play baseball for the Pittsburgh Crawfords, Ray plans another escape plan  but Claude wants no part of it, angry with the fact that 'Can't-Get-Right' was released without them. Claude gives up trying to escape and accepts the fact that he will die in prison. This leads to an argument, which in turn leads to Ray and Claude going their separate ways. During the argument, it is revealed that Ray's father was sent to such a camp and hanged himself in despair. With Ray and Claude no longer speaking, Camp 8 gets "a little harder and colder", and as 28 years  pass, all of the inmates who were friends of Ray and Claude are either released or die in prison. Many years later, in 1972, Ray and Claude are now elderly and are sent to live and work at Superintendent Dexter Wilkins'  mansion. Claude is entrusted to drive with Superintendent Wilkins to pick up the new superintendent , who happens to be none other than Sheriff Warren Pike, the man who framed them 40 years earlier. While on a hunt one day, Ray sees Pike pull out a pocket watch, and realizes that it is in fact his father's, which was taken from him 40 years earlier. Ray confronts Pike, grabs a shotgun and accuses him of murdering Hancock. When Wilkins asks if this is true, Pike brags that he not only committed the murder, but framed Ray and Claude, declaring that "the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal". Enraged, Claude and Ray begin fighting over the gun, both determined to shoot him. Pike attempts to kill them with a hidden pistol, but is shot and killed by Wilkins, who now realizes that Ray and Claude are innocent. He tells Ray and Claude he intends to write pardon papers for the two of them, but dies of a heart attack in his bathroom before he is able to do so. In 1997 , Ray and Claude are now very elderly and living in the  prison's infirmary. They realize by now that the only way they will ever leave prison is when they die. Later, while playing poker with Willie and some other inmates, Claude tells Ray of a plan that he has thought up, and after a short argument, Ray follows Claude to hear the plan. That night, however, the infirmary catches fire, and everyone is able to get out except Claude. When Willie tells Ray that he is still inside, Ray goes back in to find him. The entrance then caves in behind him, presumably killing him. In the present day, Willie concludes the tale and the two workers are saddened by the story, but he reveals that the fire was part of the plan thought up by Ray and Claude. The two bodies being buried were actually taken from the morgue; Ray and Claude planned to escape the fire and prison by hiding on the departing fire trucks. When the workers ask why the plan did not work, Willie tells them that he "never said it didn't work". Willie wheels himself away, laughing and smoking a cigarette, as the inmates realize that the bodies they buried are not Ray and Claude. Ray and Claude are back in New York, at a New York Yankees baseball game, doing what they always do: arguing. The film concludes by revealing the pair now live in Harlem together.
