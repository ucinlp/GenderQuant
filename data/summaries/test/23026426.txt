Now in their late twenties and married, Gidget and Jeff live in Santa Monica, Jeff working as an architect and Gidget as a travel agent. They have no children of their own, but are looking after Gidget's niece Kim while Anne and John  are in Europe. Their marriage is troubled, in part because they are becoming workaholics, leaving themselves too little quality time. Gidget decides to throw Jeff a surprise thirtieth birthday party including a reunion of their old surfing fiends, but this is threatened when the illness of her employee Johnny Soon means that she must fill in, coordinating a tour in Hawaii. Meanwhile, Jeff is fending off romantic advances from Anne Bedford, his beautiful and libidinous boss. Kim at fifteen and a half years old is much as Gidget was at that age. She wants to learn how to surf and gets in over her head when she sneaks out of the house to see Mickey, a suave, self-serving beach bum behind the back of Albert, her nerdy boyfriend. In the end, Johnny Soon's quick recovery brings Gidget home in the nick of time to save her marriage and rescue Kim from the tight spot she has gotten herself into.
