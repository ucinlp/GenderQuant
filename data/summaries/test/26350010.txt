The story is a flashback of the five years  of love affair involving the characters of Allan Alvarez  and Mia Samonte . The opening scene was in a Pasig River ferry boat. One of the passenger, Allan, was sad and confused if he really loved his then live-in partner, Daphne Recto . While another passenger, Mia, was downtrodden by family problems. To express her heartaches, Mia would write messages on stones and would leave them anywhere, Allan picked up one of those, they got acquainted and their romantic story began. Later, in one of their trysts they met an old man  in Paco Park who predicted that they were meant for each other and would end up together although it would take a difficult five-year ride. Allan was torn between two loves. Although he knew that he loved Mia more, he procrastinated in his choice. Mia left for Malaysia. Two years after, when Allan finally broke free from his indecision, he went to Malaysia to look for Mia only to find out that she was already engaged to another guy. It was now Mia's turn to make a choice. She chose the new guy who loved her so much even though she honestly knew in her heart that she still loved Allan. Allan did not lose hope. He patiently waited for Mia for another three years. He firmly believed that she would come back to him as predicted by the old man earlier in the story. True enough, the Malaysian guy let Mia go as he was aware of who Mia truly wanted. On the very same date foreseen by the old man, Mia returned to the Philippines, saw Allan waiting for her, and embraced each other.
