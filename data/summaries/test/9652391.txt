In a wheelchair now, old-time prizefight promoter Sean O'Malley is down and almost out. He has one good boxer left, Johnny Monterez, who also has been seeing his daughter, Pat. Pat needs to take over the business. When she goes to training camp, Johnny's hand is seriously injured in a sparring bout. Johnny asks a doctor to keep his condition a secret. Pat, meanwhile, searches for old friend Rick Garvey, a sportswriter with a drinking problem, and finds him in jail. Johnny's young cousin Luis is also in jail and needs $200. Johnny defects to another promoter, Allan Goff, which leaves Pat feeling betrayed personally and professionally. Johnny also insults Rick, who is offended by some of Johnny's personal beliefs and comments. Sean O'Malley dies, leaving Johnny feeling ashamed for abandoning him. Johnny ends up taking a dive in the big fight, but is once again a standup guy with Pat and Rick.
