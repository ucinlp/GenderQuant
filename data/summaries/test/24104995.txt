The film tells a story of three youths from Kuala Lumpur: Punai , a car jockey; Asmat , a cleaner and 'rapper wannabe'; and Johan , an 'acting star wannabe'. They each received a letter from the late Pak Sudir , inviting them to his house. Upon their arrival, they meet up with Pak Sudir's assistant, Mustika , and they discover that Pak Sudir was actually their grandfather who happens to be very rich. The three of them stand a chance to inherit all of his belongings and wealth but under strict circumstances; they would have to stay at his house for three days consecutively without touching anything, especially an old congkak. On the first night itself, strange occurrences begin to happen.
