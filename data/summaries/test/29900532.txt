In 1864 during the American Civil War, Texan Lt. Frank Hewitt  is serving with the U.S. Cavalry under Colonel John Chivington. On patrol, Hewitt meets a group of Indians who are unarmed and returning to the Sand Creek reservation which they were not supposed to leave. While briefing Col. Chivington, the Colonel orders the Sand Creek Massacre. Hewitt not only disagrees with the punishment of the Indians, but realizes they will use the attack as an excuse to unite and spread terror throughout the Southwest, including his own hometown in Texas which has been emptied of the majority of its menfolk who are fighting for the Confederacy. Colonel Chivington sees Indian attacks on Texas as a bonus to create havoc in the Confederacy. Violently objecting, Hewitt is placed under arrest and confined to quarters. Hewitt  deserts to warn the Texans but is hated and ignored as a traitor by his now confederate and former neighbours who despise him for serving with the Union. No one believes him until he brings home the dead body of a woman murdered by Comanches who have joined the uprising. Hewitt organizes a petticoat brigade of women training them in marksmanship and combat tactics. Armed and given military ranks, Hewitt and the ladies seize the day and hold onto the only safety they have in an abandoned mission . Hewitt, the "blue belly traitor", and the confederate petticoat brigade face desertion from the only remaining man and fight off scavengers and Comanches as they struggle to build trust and work together during the onslaught of blood thirsty killers. As the final gun fight is over Hewitt and his greatest female critic fall in star-crossed-love left over from childhood memories. But Hewitt cannot reciprocate because as an honorable soldier he must return to his post at Sand Creek and face charges for desertion. Col. Chivington's Commanding General happened to enter the trial room in the final hour as the Hewitt is being renounced as a deserter and a liar about a most fantastic story of helping to rescue the women in Texas and training them to fight off Commanches. As the guilty sentence and execution is about to be pronounced the female confederates return the favor marching armed into the trial to stop the proceeding. The Commanding General in amorous good will orders a surrender to the armed ladies who have saved the day proving Hewitt's trustworthiness. Hewitt's testimony snares Col. Chivington  and his hopes in his new found confederate love are restored.
