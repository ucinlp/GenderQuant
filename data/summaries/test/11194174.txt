Southall United Football Club, composed entirely of South Asian players, is facing its deepest crisis ever. It is bankrupt, with no stars, no coach, no sponsors, no spectators and, most importantly, no owner. When the club falls behind on the lease payments for its home ground, the city council sends a notice ordering it to vacate the ground so that it can be demolished to make way for a commercial complex. South Asian football commentator Johnny Bakshi  serves as the frontman for the council, and although he pays lip-service to the contrary, very much looks forward to the demise of Southall United and the construction of the complex. The club has only one way to save itself, its home ground and its honour &ndash; win the Combined Counties Football League championship and its prize money of Â£3&nbsp;million, a very tall task indeed. Southall United captain Shaan Ali Khan  takes on the challenge of trying to save the club. First, he convinces a disesteemed ex-player, Tony Singh  to become the team's coach, despite its being branded the laughing stock of English football. Shaan and Tony set about rebuilding the tattered club, and the team works hard to prepare for its first match. Meanwhile, Sunny Bhasin ([[John Abraham  is an ace striker who wishes to one day play for the England national football team. However, his dreams are shattered when he is cut by Aston, an English football team consisting entirely of white players, on account of his skin colour.  Sunny has always disregarded his Indian background and considered Southall United to be a joke of a club, and initially rejects outright an offer from Tony to play for Southall United. However, after Sunny's humiliating rejection by Aston, Tony again approaches him. Telling Sunny he is sad but not shocked about what happened with Aston, he again offers him a place at Southall United. Sunny, though, again turns Tony down, boasting that no Southall player can tackle him and that he could score against them in 10 seconds flat. In response, Tony challenges Sunny to a ten-minute match in which Sunny must steal the ball from Tony; Tony defeats Sunny handily, proving that although he has been discredited, he has not lost his skills. Seeing that he still has much to learn, Sunny finally agrees to join Southall United. The other members of the club, especially Shaan, are not happy that Sunny has become their teammate, as on many previous occasions he had vandalized their homes and shops, but they eventually warm to him somewhat. With Sunny on board, Southall United begins its climb up the Combined Counties points standings. With success after success, the team is elated. To go along with his success with the club, Sunny has also managed to gain the affections of Rumana , Shaan's sister and the club's physical therapist, much to the captain's chagrin. Nonetheless, Southall keeps winning, worrying Johnny Bakshi and the Southall city council. Johnny devises a scheme to lure Sunny away from Southall United in order to deprive the team of its ace striker and, by extension, victories. He convinces Sunny to sign a lucrative contract to play for Millwall F.C. Shaan and the rest of the club are angered by his betrayal, and Rumana is heartbroken. However, Johnny's plan backfires when Sunny learns that his father, who had been staunchly against his son's football career, had been a Southall United supporter and had survived a beating at the hands of whites outside of a bar when Southall had last contended for the Combined Counties championship back in 1985. Moreover, the man who he had saved from that beating was none other than Tony Singh, the current coach of Southall United. Realizing his mistake, Sunny returns to Southall and resolves to stand up for his rights and that of South Asians all over the UK. The team ultimately claims the Combined Counties title, preventing the city council's plan to demolish its stadium.
