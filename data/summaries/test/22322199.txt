Maker , a hip-hop music mogul and crime boss, helps broker a deal between Noah , a major dealer in illegal arms, and a consortium of extremist groups. However, Maker was cut out of the loop at the last minute and he's eager to get revengeâ€”and his piece of the action. He initially uses Davis , an employee of a shipping company, to send his merchandise around the world, but when the company upgrades to computer-based tracking, he brings in Jason , a digital-savvy workaholic trying to wipe out the memory of his first wife. Jason earns a big cut of Davis' profits, and is introduced to his world of fast times and loose women, including Laura , a sweet but streetwise hooker. Unknown to the others, FBI Agent Diane  is watching Noah's deal in order to put him and his crew behind bars, but she doesn't realize that several of the players have hidden agendas.A major arms deal is going down, and 3 separate characters are desperately trying to get in on it. Each is either a true career criminal, out for personal profit or an undercover agent, intercepting to elevate a CV. Everyone is playing each other off against one another.
