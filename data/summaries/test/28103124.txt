The VH1 News special is the story of a very unlikely rock band who have managed to defy politics, culture and fundamentalism all in the name of music. Translated, "Junoon" means "passion" - and that's what this 10- year-old rock group has brought to a Pakistani music scene that has often been forced underground. The group has been banned for nearly half of its existence, yet has still sold millions of records. Two years ago, it won Channel V award for "Best International Group", beating out the likes of Backstreet Boys and The Prodigy.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-LBNAGId8A Retrieved on July 21, 2010.
