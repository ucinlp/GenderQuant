Dr Sudhir  returns from UK after his father's death to take care of family business. To decorate an empty section of a room, Sudhir buys an old Piano from a local shop. Weird things start happening after he buys the Piano. He meets a mysterious woman Maria  who tells him that while he can play Piano as he is the new owner, he should not let others play it. The first person to play the piano against her advice dies as soon as she has finished playing. Soon a long time house-servant dies and Dr Sudhir is a suspect. Complicating the situation is a local businessman Shankarlal  who might be helping the Police against Dr Sudhir.
