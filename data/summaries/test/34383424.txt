As her investigations progress, Rachel encounters opposition from school administrators and is "warned off" by a variety of anonymous messages, including graffiti on Dina's grave. After a series of false leads, Rachel eventually discovers the real culprit to be her so-called friend Patricia Reid , whose daughter Skylar  was beaten by Dina to a field hockey scholarship. Disgusted at her mother's actions, Skylar drives recklessly away in the family car, which she crashes. She loses the use of both legs, while Patricia is prosecuted for distributing child pornography.
