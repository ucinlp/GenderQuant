The film revolves around three bachelors, Meet , Prem  and Amar . Their lives are almost as good as normal, until they get married and their lives turn to hell. Meet marries Anchal  who is obsessively possessive about her husband, Prem marries Geeta  who is overly religious and thus their life suffers, and Amar marries Bindiya  who is dominating and has an equally horrendous mother. They get together one last night and try to think of a way to get away from their wives for some time, reliving their fun bachelor days. The men set their sights on other women but eventually realize they have all been seeing the same girl, Monica . She blackmails them that if they do not give her all their money, she will tell their wives all about their affairs. When they bring the money to Monica, she is found dead in a car the next day. There, the trio meet police officer Sikander  who starts following them. Eventually, when Monica's killer finds the three man, he asks for the money or they will die just like Monica; when they bring the money, Sikander is already there. They have been caught, but it is revealed that Sikander is Bindiya's cousin and Monica, who is alive, is Anchal's best friend. They built the scheme with the wives to teach their hubbies a lesson. The film ends with the men learning a lesson and living happily ever after with their wives.
