In the tollbooth of a parking garage in rainy London, Martin Lomax is watching The Human Centipede on his laptop, a film he is obsessed with, and he keeps a centipede in a glass terrarium and maintains a detailed scrapbook of the film. Martin lives with his suicidal mother who constantly yells at him and blames him for having his father put in prison for both physically and sexually abusing Martin when he was a boy. Dr. Sebring, Martin's psychiatrist, also touches him inappropriately and prescribes heavy medication. Martin acquires a dingy, dimly-lit warehouse after killing the lessor and begins abducting people from the car park to use as for his own human centipede by knocking them unconscious with a crowbar, then binding their hands and feet with tape and driving them to the warehouse. The film chronicles Martin kidnapping his victims which include: an aggressive young man and his girlfriend, two drunk girls who catch Martin masturbating with sandpaper, a dad and his pregnant wife, and a man who complains about the ATM having no cash. Martin catches Dr. Sebring and a cabbie having sex with a prostitute, and proceeds to kill Sebring and abduct the cabbie and prostitute. When Martin's mother finds his scrapbook, Martin kills her by bludgeoning her head several times with his crowbar, after which he takes her corpse and sets it at the dinner table and eats across from it . Martin's last victim is Ashlynn Yennie, the actress who played Jenny in the first film . With twelve victims, Martin begins assembling his "centipede". Martin severs the tendons in each person's knees to prevent them from fleeing and uses a hammer to knock out their teeth. He slices open the buttocks of one of his victims using a kitchen knive, causing him to bleed to death. In a quick change of plan, he uses a staple gun and duct tape to attach each person's lips to the next person's buttocks. During the assembly process, the pregnant woman is presumed dead; Martin places her in the corner of the room under a sheet of tarp, along with the lessor, Dr. Sebring, and the other dead victim. His "human centipede" is ultimately 10 people long with Ashlynn in the front. After performing the crude procedure, Martin, now clad only in his underwear and a doctor’s coat, begins experimenting with his "human centipede". Martin force-feeds Ashlynn soup using a funnel and tubing after she refuses to eat from a bowl. Worried that her screams for help might be heard, Martin tears her tongue out with a pair of pliers. Martin then injects each victim with a syringe of laxative, forcing each individual in the chain to explosively evacuate their bowels into the mouth of the person behind them. He laughs happily while mocking and taunting them, but the smell eventually causes Martin to vomit. Martin then wraps his penis in barbed wire and rapes the woman at the rear of the centipede. As he finishes, the pregant woman wakes and runs outside screaming, apparently in labour. She leaps into a victim’s car outside and births her child into the car's foot well as Martin tries to get in. As the engine starts, she throws the vehicle into reverse and stomps on the accelerator, crushing the baby's skull under the pedal. Meanwhile, the neighbor rips his face from the person in front of him, separating the "centipede" into two halves. Martin returns and begins shooting all the victims. When he runs out of ammunition, he then uses a knife to slit the throats of the remaining victims. As Martin advances on Ashlynn he appears to give pause, drops the knife and kneels in front of her. She then punches him in the genitals, shoves the funnel into Martin's rectum, and drops his pet centipede into it. In agony, Martin stabs Ashlynn in the face and staggers out, screaming. Ashlynn is seen slightly moving afterwards. The scene cuts back to the toll booth, as Martin, looking the same as before the creation of his "centipede", is watching the credits of First Sequence on his laptop, while a baby can be heard crying in the background.
