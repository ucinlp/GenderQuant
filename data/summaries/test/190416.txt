In the Mississippi Delta, failing, bigoted, middle-aged cotton gin-owner Archie Lee Meighan  has been married to pretty, empty-headed 19-year old virgin Baby Doll Meighan  for two years. Archie impatiently waits for Baby Doll's 20th birthday just a few days away when, by prior agreement with Baby Doll's dying father, the marriage can finally be consummated. In the meantime, Baby Doll still sleeps in a crib, wearing childish shorty-nightgowns and sucking her thumb, while Archie spies on her through a hole in a wall of their decrepit antebellum mansion, "Fox Tail." Archie's competitor, Sicilian Silva Vacarro , who owns a newer and more modern cotton gin, has taken away all of Archie's business, and Archie retaliates by burning down Vacarro's gin. Suspecting Archie as the arsonist, Vacarro plans his revenge: he will pursue and seduce Baby Doll and terrorize her into signing an affidavit admitting her husband's guilt.<ref name67860&category=Full&nbsp;Synopsis "Full Synopsis"] on TCM.com
