The Stooges are vaudeville entertainers who trek to Mexico to perform their gag bull fight shtick, with Joe as the brave matador, and Moe and Larry dressed in a bull costume. Unfortunately, their gig is cancelled once they arrive, leaving them stranded. Feeling bad for them, attractive señorita Greta  gets the boys a gig at the local bull ring. Joe is so ecstatic that he plants a kiss right on Greta's cheek, much to the chagrin of her jealous husband José . In an act of revenge, José pays the bullring attendant  to release a live bull into the ring. Moe and Larry flee the ring, but Joe is unaware of the switch. He eventually head-butts the wild animal, and is paraded out of the ring to the rousing cheers of "Olé, Americano!"
