Major General Amarjeet Singh  is a dedicated officer for the Indian army. His son Lieutenant Commander Vikramjeet Singh  follows in his footsteps and joins the navy. Amarjeet is extremely proud of Vikramjeet but tragedy strikes when Vikramjeet is killed in action in a torpedo attack by a French made Ghazi class enemy Pakistani sub during the 1971 Indo-Pak conflict. After the defeat of Pakistan and India's victory everything is forgotten but the hatred and rivalry by a captured Pakistani POW remains. Years later Kunal joins army but has no intentions of remaining there. Amarjeet succeeds in making Kunal do something to honour his deceased father. Kunal comes across a desert party and sees Shweta Bhansali . It is love at first sight for him but she totally ignores him and does everything to avoid him. However she is doing this for a reason- she was once married. Shweta fell in love and married Major Rajeev Singh , unfortunately he was deployed for action on his wedding day and he had to leave his newly wed bride... In 1971 during the Indo-Pak war and the formation of Bangladesh, Lt. Commander Vikramjeet Singh has a ship in his command and a regiment of soldiers of the Indian Army, commandeered by his dad, Major General Amarjeet Singh. The ship comes under attack by a submarine of the Pakistani Navy, undergoes damage, and sinks along with Vikramjeet, but not before he courageously rescues about a hundred of trapped army soldiers. Years later, Vikramjeet's son Kunaljeet joins the army as a Captain, but he lacks the values his dad and grandfather had in them about serving the country selflessly. He just wants to be employed with the army for a couple of years, then re-locate to the U.S., run a business, and make lots of money. In order to accomplish this he always makes up excuses of not going to the front. He falls in love with Shweta Bhansali, and decides to stay in the army in order to be close to her. In order to achieve a medal, he fakes heroism; then carelessly jeopardizes a planned attack on terrorists and as a result several terrorist escape to their hideouts. Disciplined and chastised, an injured and humbled Kunaljeet awaits to meet his sweetheart - only to find out that she is in love and married to his senior Officer Major Rajeev Singh,who is assumed to be dead but actually is a prisoner of war. The only thread binding him to the army is broken, and it is then Kunaljeet finds out that the terrorists in collusion with rebel Pakistani officers are planning to bomb the Bhagwan Shivji's Amarnath Temple in Jammu & Sikkim in order to wipe out the Hindu religion and culture once and for all. Will Kunaljeet act accordingly to save some lives, or will his rashness result in more casualties
