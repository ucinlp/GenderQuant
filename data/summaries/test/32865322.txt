Two friends have hopes of traveling around Europe. As they need to fund the trip, they enlist as patients in allergy drug testing, a sure way to make easy money. However it turns out that rather than allergy medicine testing, they have enlisted in a government sponsored program on human regeneration. They are overwhelmed by the reality and seek to escape the medical unit.
