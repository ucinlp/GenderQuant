{{expand section}} Header parallels the grueling psychological journeys taken by Stewart Cummings, a jaded ATF Special Agent working his dead-end job and Travis Clyde Tuckton, a bumpkin ex-con who returns home from prison to be with his handicapped grandfather, Jake Martin. Stewart struggles to provide for his sickly girlfriend, Kathy, whose medicine cost more than he can afford – that is until he starts running narcotics across the county line for a man named Dutch. Meanwhile, Travis’ grandfather educates his grandson about generations of family feuds and encourages him to enact revenge. Their stories become linked and descend into barbarity when Stewart begins to investigate the nauseatingly violent murders of mountain-folk in the area. Both Stewart and Travis blindly follow the motivating force of love, justifying their actions along the way, until they’re led down colliding paths of death and self-destruction.
