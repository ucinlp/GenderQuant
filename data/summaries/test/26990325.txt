Upon seeing his mother Linda terrorized by three thugs, young Petey is traumatized and wanders off. Truck drivers find him and the boy is brought to police headquarters, where he is recognized as the son of detective Tony Atlas. Petey is in shock and momentarily can't even recognize his dad, much less explain what happened. The youths who have Tony's wife are named Joey, Gil and Jess. It turns out they have robbed and killed Linda's employer, Canfield, and are arguing whether to also kill her, the only eyewitness. Canfield's niece comes looking for him, but upon finding Linda's car mistakenly believes he might be having an affair with her. Gil slips away to retrieve a gun from his mother's house. Tony gets the drop on him and kills Gil in self-defense, finding Linda's wallet on him. The truckers provide the general vicinity of where they found the boy. Petey seems to recognize a tractor, so Tony's men find Canfield's body and surround the house. Joey is accidentally killed by Jess, who is disarmed by Tony. At the sight of his mother, Petey emerges from his state of shock.
