Passione chronicles the rich Neapolitan musical heritage, tracing the influences of European, African and Arabic cultures, while touching on the Canzone Napoletana  tradition. The film features dozens of contemporary solo performers and ensembles who are currently established on the city's music scene, including Pietra Montecorvino, James Senese, Peppe Barra, Mina, Fausto Cigliano, and Rosario Fiorello. The film also explores the city's music history with archival footage and accounts of such historic artists as Enrico Caruso, Sergio Bruni, Massimo Ranieri, and Renato Carosone. Passione is the fourth film directed by Turturro, who is primarily known for his film and television acting roles. In addition to co-writing the screenplay, he appears on-camera sporadically, serving as tour guide, cultural commentator, and occasional extra in music shoots. Scenes were filmed at San Domenico Maggiore's Square, at Castel dell'Ovo, at Castel Sant'Elmo and at Solfatara.
