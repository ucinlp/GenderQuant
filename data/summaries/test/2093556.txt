 Marianne Danielle, a young French schoolteacher from Paris en route to take up a position in Transylvania, is abandoned in a village by her coach driver. At the local inn, she ignores the warnings of the locals and accepts the offer of Baroness Meinster to spend the night at her castle. At the castle, she sees the Baroness's handsome son, whom she is told is insane and kept confined . When she sneaks to meet him, he says his mother usurped his rightful lands and pleads for her to help. She agrees, and steals the key to his chain from the Baroness' bedroom. Upon discovery of this, the Baroness is horrified; yet when her son appears, she obeys him and goes into the next room. Later, the servant Greta  goes into hysterics. She forces Marianne to look at the Baroness' body, and the puncture marks in her throat. Marianne flees into the night. She is found, exhausted, by Dr. Van Helsing the following morning. She doesn't remember all that has happened, nor is she familiar when asked with the words "undead" or "vampirism." He escorts her to the school where she's to be employed. When Van Helsing reaches the village inn, he finds there is a funeral in progress. A young girl has been found dead in the woods with wounds upon her throat. He contacts Father Stepnik, who turns out to have asked the expert on vampirism to come here. Father Stepnik has suspicions about the castle and the Baroness. That night, Baron Meinster's first victim rises from her grave, aided by Greta, as witnessed by Van Helsing and the priest. The newly vampirized village girl flees while Greta tries to hold off the two men. Van Helsing goes to the castle and discovers the Baroness, now risen as a vampire herself, as well as the Baron. After a brief scuffle, the Baron flees, abandoning his mother who, in her undead state, is full of self-loathing and guilt. After sunrise the next morning, Van Helsing "releases" her with a wooden stake. The Baron, meanwhile, visits Marianne at the school and asks her to marry him. She accepts, much to the good-natured envy of her roommate Gina. Once Gina is alone, however, Baron Meinster appears and consumes Gina's blood. When Van Helsing comes for a visit the next day, he finds the school in a small uproar over Gina's death. Van Helsing gives instructions about the body — to be kept away from the school, place it in a horse stable and with people watching it until he returns. As it happens, Marianne comes to relieve the school master from her duties. Initially she is with the stable keeper, Severien. But, in a scene derived from M. R. James' "Count Magnus," the locks on the coffin fall off . Severien goes to get stronger locks, leaving Marianne alone with the coffin as night falls. Serverin is killed by a vampire bat  while the last lock falls from the coffin. The coffin lid is pushed opened and Gina rises, now a vampire and bearing her newly gained fangs at Marianne. She talks soothingly to a terrified Marianne as she slowly approaches her, asking forgiveness for "letting him love me," and wanting to "kiss" her. She also reveals the whereabouts of the Baron , who is hiding at the old mill. Van Helsing discovers the body Severin, and enters the stable, stopping Gina from biting Marianne and forcing her to escape. Helsing takes Marianne back to the school to calm her down. Marianne doesn't want to believe the Baron, and now Gina, are vampires but Van Helsing confirms that they are, citing that the Gina she knows is indeed dead and has come back as an evil vampire bride loyal to the Baron. Reluctantly, Marianne tells Van Helsing what Gina told her. The vampire hunter goes to the old mill and is confronted by both of Meinster's "Brides" as well as Greta—who, as a human, isn't repelled by the cross. Greta is killed in a fall but the cross falls into the well below the mill and is now out of Van Helsing's reach as the Baron arrives, brandishing a length of chain. In the fight that follows, the Baron manages to subdue Van Helsing and bites him, inflicting him with vampirism before leaving. When Van Helsing wakes, he realizes what has happened. He heats a metal tool in a brazier until it is red-hot, then cauterizes his throat wound and pours holy water on it to purify it; the wounds immediately disappear . As he does this, Gina and the village girl watch from the rafters, shocked that Helsing overcame a vampire bite. Baron Meinster, meanwhile, goes to Marianne and forces her to come with him to the old mill. He intends to bite and turn her into a vampire in front of Van Helsing. Helsing warns Marianne to not look into his eyes but the Baron forces her to. Just as it seems she'll give into his hypnotic gaze. Van Helsing spots the canteen of holy water on the ground. Gina and the village girl see this and hiss to their master. Helsing reaches the canteen and throws holy water into the Baron's face, which sears him like acid. Meinster kicks over the brazier of hot coals, starting a fire. While the Baron flees outside, Van Helsing takes Marianne up into the mill, then out via the huge sails, which he moves to form the shadow a gigantic cross. The shadows falls on Baron Meinster, who is killed by it. Helsing goes to ground level to make sure he's dead then comforts Marianne as the mill burns. Meinster's vampire brides  die in the fire.
