They also discover an ancient book which contains a black magic spell that conjures a demon from the pits of hell. Jamie takes charge of the group and endeavors to summon the demon, using the book. The spell includes making a human sacrifice. However, Faith has a change of heart and attempts to stop them from completing their ritual.
