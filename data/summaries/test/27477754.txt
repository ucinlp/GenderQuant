The Royal Winnipeg Ballet's Summer School Program is the first step to beginning a career as a professional ballet dancer. But that doesn't mean that it's easy. 9 young girls come from all over the world to enter the program, knowing that if they don't get in by a certain age, it will be far too late to become a ballerina. A dancer can try her hardest but not make it into the next stage just based on her physical musculature. Those that do make it face a difficult decision - spend their childhood and teen years away from their families and focusing on the daily strains of ballet training, or live as a normal teenager.
