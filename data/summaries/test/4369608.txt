Jon Cold  is an ex-CIA agent who's now working for himself and offering his services to the highest bidder. Jon is hired to break James Donovan  out of prison. After the successful break, Jon takes James to see his brother, arms dealer Michael Donovan , the man who hired Jon to break James out. In gratitude, the Donovans hire Jon to help sell the parts for a small nuclear bomb to Nicholi , the leader of a Chechan terrorist group that is planning to blow up Los Angeles because the CIA killed the group's previous leader. Meanwhile, Jon's former protégé, agent Amanda Stuart , is spying on the Donovans for the CIA. The Donovans see her spying on them while they're in the middle of the deal with Nicholi. Jon rescues Amanda and takes Michael hostage. Nicholi really doesn't care what happens to Michael, so that doesn't really work as well as it should have. Jon and Amanda find themselves on the run, trying to keep the Donovans out of the way and stop Nicholi from blowing up the city. Also, Jon has been framed for the killings of some of his former CIA co-workers, so there's a shoot-on-sight directive on his head. It'll be a miracle of Jon can clear his name and keep Los Angeles from getting blown up.
