The film, based on folkloric beliefs and set in Lapland, centers on the young woman Pirita. In the snowy landscape, Pirita and Aslak meet, and soon marry. It is not long, however, before the shepherd husband wanders off, leaving his wife lonely and heartbroken. In an effort to solve her marital problems, Pirita visits the local shaman, who indeed helps her out, but in the process turns her into a shapeshifting, vampiric reindeer who preys upon the villagers.
