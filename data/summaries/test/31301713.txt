On the eve of the Battle of El Alamein, Sergeant Joe Gunn and the crew of his tank Lulabell come across a group of Allied stragglers at a destroyed First Aid Station. The stragglers led by British doctor Captain Halliday decide to ride with Gunn in an attempt to escape the advancing Afrika Korps. Picking up a downed Luftwaffe flier, an African soldier and his Italian prisoner they end up at a deserted Saharan oasis in search for water. With the Germans right behind them they decide to stay and defend the well, holding up the Germans at the same time. One by one they are reduced in number as the Germans keep coming.
