{{plot}} The movie opens as Minkey, a super-spy primate with uncanny abilities, rescues his partner Mike Muggins  from Middle Eastern terrorists. Their secretary, Edith ([[Debra Jo Rupp  congratulates them as the two best spies in the business, but Mikes informs her that he is going to retire to be with his wife and daughter. The movie then flashes forward ten years. Mike's wife  had died, and his daughter, Amelia , is a child prodigy, having invented a revolutionary oxygen iodide laser drill. Amelia is about to receive the prestigious National Scientific Achievement Award from the world's two leading scientists, Dr. Robert Farley and Dr. Claudette Amour . Mike encourages her, telling her how proud he is of her, and also reminds her that Minkey is in town, now the star of a circus show. Mike offers to take Amelia to Minkey's show, but Amelia laughs it off, remembering those "silly stories" he used to tell her about life as a spy. As Amelia leaves for school, it is revealed that Hugo , a stereotypical movie henchman, is following her and taking pictures of her. Amelia receives the National Scientific Achievement Award, although she is disappointed to find that Dr. Amour is unable to be there. As she and Mike leave, Dr. Farley discreetly videotapes Mike with a pen-camcorder. The next day, Dr. Farley shows up in a black limousine and kidnaps Amelia, telling her that her father has a surprise for her. He has a manipulated video of Mike confirming this, and Amelia happily goes with Dr. Farley. Dr Farley takes her to Japan, explaining that it is a "top-secret government program." He has built a full-scale model of Amelia's drill, but it is not working properly; Amelia begins working on it. Meanwhile, Hugo delivers a package to Mikeâ€”it's a video of Dr. Farley, who promises not to hurt Amelia as long as Mike does not contact the authorities. Mike springs into action, contacting Edith and Minkey and persuading them to come out of retirement to help him save Amelia. Minkey's new friends from the circus are also enlisted as spies; while Mike and Minkey fly to Jamaica to find Dr. Amour, Edith brings the performers up to speed on the project. Apparently, Minkey was genetically enhanced and specially trained as a part of operation SPYMATE, but when the Russians moved in on the project, Mike was ordered to terminate Minkey. After Minkey exhibited his formidable martial arts skills against KGB agents, Mike requested him as a partner. Meanwhile, Mike and Minkey find Dr. Amour, who tells them that Dr. Farley plans to use Amelia's drill to cut through the Earth's crust in a Japanese volcano and harness the heat energy of the Earth's core. However, according to Dr. Amour's calculation, the energy is too chaotic and will cause a massive earthquake that could even wipe Japan off the map. Dr. Amour agrees to take Mike and Minkey to Dr. Farley's Japanese drill site. Meanwhile, Amelia remembers how to fix the drill, but is becoming suspicious of Dr. Farley. She tries to escape, but is captured and held prisoner. Meanwhile, Mike, Minkey, and Dr. Amour parachute into the drill site. Dr. Amour and Mike are captured, but Minkey manages to escape with the help of a Japanese ninja sensai, who "has been awaiting him." The sensai and his students tell Minkey how to breach Dr. Farley's lab and promise him their help. Dr. Farley threatens to kill Mike and Dr. Amour if Amelia does not fix the drill. Amelia reluctantly tells him to put an elastic band around the drill to dampen the sympathetic resonance. Dr. Farley begins drilling into the earth and tells Hugo to kill Mike and Dr. Amour. As Mike and Dr. Amour are being escorted out, Minkey ambushes Hugo. Mike fights off the other guards while Dr. Amour and Minkey run to the drill chamber. Dr. Amour distracts Dr. Farley while Mike and Minkey take out the guards in the drill chamber and rescue Amelia. Many more guards pour in, but Minkey's ninja friends drop out of the ceiling. Dr. Amour and Amelia manage to stop the drill by overriding its temperature controls, but this causes it to explode. Mike, Minkey, Dr. Amour, and Amelia barely escape the exploding lab. Outside, Amelia exclaims to Mike that he really is a spy, to which Mike replies, "Yes, I really am." Minkey receives a call from the president requesting his services in a "delicate matter" and snowboards away to more adventures.
