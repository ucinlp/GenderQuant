Charles Boulin is a debt collector for a credit company called Cr√©dilem. After his wife Anne accuses him of being tight-fisted, he decides to surprise her by buying a house in the country... but before he manages to do so the house is snatched up by one of his colleagues. In his disappointment he steals his colleague's bag which contains the signed deeds. As he has already been given several warnings at work, he is sacked on the spot. To reduce renovation costs, Charles Boulin seeks the help of Jean-Pierre Draquart, the shifty estate agent who sold him the second house in his catalogue. This swindler calls up his "best team": Mouloud Mami and Donatello Pirelli - who as workers are both perfectly incompetent. As the renovation progresses, the house gradually turns into ruins. Charles soon finds himself in debt after being refused a bank loan and then has to sell the family apartment without letting his wife or daughter find out. He survives on odd jobs, whilst scheming in order to convince his family to move into the "new" house...
