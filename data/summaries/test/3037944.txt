{{plot}} Ben Randall  is the top rescue swimmer at the United States Coast Guard's Aviation Survival Technician  program. Jake Fischer  is a hot-shot candidate for AST who was ranked as a top competitive swimmer in high school with scholarships to every Ivy league college, but opted to enlist in the Coast Guard. The film's title is introduced by a mythic tale: people lost at sea often claim they feel a presence lifting them to the surface, breathing life into their bodies while they are waiting for help to arrive. They call this presence "The Guardian." Ben is confronted by his wife, asking for a separation due to his frequent time at work. He receives a page for an immediate rescue. Out at sea, he loses his rescue team in an HH-60J Jayhawk helicopter crash and while waiting in a survival raft, his best friend, Chief Petty Officer Carl Billings , dies. Shaken, he is forced to either retire or teach at a Coast Guard training school; he reluctantly chooses the latter. Here, Jake arrives as a hopeful AST candidate at "A" school, where Ben is considered a legend with a countless number of saves. During the training, Jake meets a local schoolteacher, Emily Thomas, and they begin a "casual" relationship, as they both know their time together is limited. Once the initial weeks of training are over and most of the students dropped out, detailed instruction begins at the academy. After sleeping at Emily’s house, Jake arrives late to class and is confronted by Ben. Although Jake is not dropped, he is punished for his tardiness. Ben tries to force Jake into quitting, but he later sees his persistence and dedication. Meeting Emily in a bar, Jake tells her about him beating all of his instructor Ben Randall's records. However, Maggie the barkeep , an old friend of Ben's, tells Jake of an unbreakable record, in which a rescue at a ship fire, Ben worked tirelessly to save all the victims. With one man left and a broken winch, Randall held the man by his fingertips for the entire flight to land, resulting in extensive injuries to his hand and shoulder. Later, during instruction, Jake's friend Charlie Hodge is unable to cope with panicked victims in the water and is afraid of failing school, so Jake takes him out for a drink to cheer him up. After ending up in a Navy bar, they get involved in a fight and land in jail, leaving Jake's girlfriend stood up. Jake arrives back at base beaten and bandaged where he takes the blame entirely. Ben confronts Jake as to why he left his prospects as a competitive swimmer to join the AST program, and tells Jake what he learned about Jake's past: on a late night out, Jake, the designated driver, got into an accidental automobile crash, resulting in the deaths of his high school relay team. After a moment of sorrow, Ben and Jake share common ground; they both know how it feels to be the only survivor. Instruction is nearing completion and Jake takes to the role of leader during exercises. At graduation only a handful of the original candidates remain. Emily comes to see Jake graduate, but the two part ways because Jake is leaving town. Jake is assigned to CG Air Station Kodiak, Alaska, which is Randall's old post. On a mission together, they are sent to rescue two kayakers trapped in a cave. Ben experiences flashbacks and appears to be incapacitated during the rescue. Ben retires and tells Jake of his only record he kept track of – the 22 people he lost during his career. Ben apologizes to his wife and gives her the divorce papers. Back at the station, Ben hears of a capsized ship and opts to join Jake on the rescue mission. Jake gets trapped in the hull while unsuccessfully trying to save the ship's captain, prompting Ben to go in and save him. Technical difficulties endanger the rescuers and survivors and Ben decides to sacrifice himself by falling from the helicopter. Jake catches him and tells him he will not let him go. Ben acknowledges this and unstraps his glove, plummeting from a fatal height into the ocean. Ben does not resurface. Jake is on a rescue mission sometime later when one of the survivors tells of a man in the sea who refuses to let go. Jake connects this to the legend, as well as Ben. He goes back to Emily and they rekindle their relationship.
