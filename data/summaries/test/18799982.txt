The Bellas are a proud family of Italian Americans living in Boston, Massachusetts. Joe is a soon-to-be retired construction worker and his wife Marilyn a home-maker. Their oldest son Tony is married, while their youngest daughter Jan is about to tie the knot herself. This leaves Renata, the eldest daughter, feeling upset and confused as to what the future may bring. After learning that her boyfriend Rob is not planning on marrying her, Renata leaves him for good. She winds up meeting a charming, albeit abrasive salesman named Sam Sharpe. The two begin a courtship but Renata's family is skeptical of Sam from the get-go, especially Jan. Their parents, Joe and Marilyn, are more easily manipulated by the fun-loving Sam, who has given their daughter a happy, up-scale life. But even they come to resent his uncouth behavior, chain-smoking and constant meddling. Sam and Renata are married and have a child, but Sam has a heart attack at the baptism and is confined to a wheelchair as a result. While watching Renata skate one day, Sam dies while still holding their baby. Renata mourns her husband, but at the same time is grateful for the time they spent together and for Sam changing her life for the better.
