A year after 17-year-old Yuval leaves home in Israel to attend the United World College in Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina, filmmaker David Fisher, his father, follows. During three Round-Trips to Mostar, Yuval’s relationships unfold: between him and his father, his Israeli peers and his Spanish girlfriend, Neus. These stories are set against the backdrop of this college, situated on what used to be the frontline between the Croatians and the Bosniaks, during the civil war that ended in 1995. Although Yuval is far from home, this actually brings father and son closer together. Their talks reveal great honesty, maturity and openness towards one another. Yuval’s roommate is Salam, an Israeli Arab, with whom he holds passionate political debates. Salam is a “playboy” and a charmer, so it’s no wonder Yuval brings him a sugar cube to bed, one morning after a bitter fight they had over Middle Eastern politics. With them are also Niv, who talks very honestly about his encounter with Arab peers, stating that back home the word “Arab” is used in a derogative way amongst his friends, a fact he is now ashamed of; and Niva – she just wants to be an actress and doesn’t know what to expect from her army service. The film is filled with John Hughes-like scenes of the life of these youngsters at the college, but with the ironic setting of a city that a lot of the time reminds them of home. Yuval’s affair with Neus is heart-warming but doomed - because of Yuval’s impending army service. This is during the Gaza War back home and Yuval voices his apprehension about the way the Israeli army is operating. At the end of this journey, David, as well as the viewers, will understand that Yuval and his peers' intense two years in Mostar have actually prepared them for a mature and challenging life as grownups.
