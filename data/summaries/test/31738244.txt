Dr. Bragan ([[James Craig  is a NASA mathematician working on a mission to outer space. The stress of the mission causes him to have a mental breakdown, so his assistant, Dr. Paul Nakamura , suggests he takes a vacation in Japan to recuperate. In Japan, Dr. Bragan stays at a hotel with his beautiful assistant, Dr. Hanamura , to begin experiments on a plant he brought from America. The plant is a Venus Flytrap, and the scientist crosses it with a Japanese carnivorous plant to create a creature that is almost human.
