The film tracks the sexual awakenings of three 15-year-old female friends over the course of a single summer. Finding privacy in the solitude of the swimming pool locker room, blossoming teens Marie , Anne  and Floriane  come to learn the true meaning of arousal and the power of sexual attraction. Marie seems to be physically and emotionally attracted to Floriane. Both Floriane and Anne are members of a synchronised swimming team, The Stade Franas Swimmers. Marie expresses an interest in joining the team in order to become closer to Floriane, whom the other girls regard as a 'slut.' Floriane exhibits her protectiveness for and caring attitude towards Marie when the former gives the latter a medal she was awarded. When Marie sees Anne at a later point in time, Anne is resentful towards Marie for ignoring her. Marie tells Anne that she was just spending time at her cousin's. Anne accepts this explanation. The next day, Anne speaks to a young man upon whom she has a crush, Francois. Meanwhile, Floriane confesses to Marie that she has not yet had sex, despite what everyone else on the swim team seems to think. Floriane tells Marie that the rest of the young women on the team make up rumours because they do not like her. In fact, Floriane does not have many female friends. Floriane tells Marie that one day, she was practicing in the water and the swimming instructor showed her his penis under the water. When Floriane asks Marie if she has any similar stories to tell, Marie is quiet and Floriane tells her that she is very lucky. When they go to Floriane's place, they spend time together lying on Floriane's the bed holding hands. After a swim practice, Marie feels affronted when she sees Floriane kissing Francois. Floriane, however, tells Marie that she is afraid of what will happen if Francois discovers that she is really not a slut and is hesitant about the prospect of having sex. After spending the night at a nightclub, where Floriane kisses an older man, she tells Marie that she really likes her. In fact, she wants Marie to be her 'first'. Marie rejects Floriane. Later that day, Marie meets Anne at a shopping mall. Anne shoplifts a necklace. When the two eat lunch at McDonald's, Marie tells Anne that she is immature and then leaves the eating establishment. When Anne enters the male swimming pool locker room after her confrontation with Marie, she gives Francois the necklace, which he then gives to Floriane. She confesses to Marie that Francois wants to see her tonight when her parents are not at home. Marie then states that she will do what Floriane had asked her to do. In bed, it seems as if Marie accomplished the goal. When Anne sees Marie, she tells her friend that Floriane had sex with Francois. After Marie and Anne, share a kiss, Marie tells Anne that she likes somebody. Anne assumes that Marie has a heterosexual crush. At the swimming party, Anne spits into Francois's mouth when he attempts to have sex with her. In the locker room, Marie and Floriane share a passionate kiss. Floriane leaves Marie in tears when she indicates that she is going back to the party, telling Marie to 'save her' if Francois turns out to be 'an ass.' The film concludes with Marie jumping fully clothed into the pool, with Anne following Marie's actions once Marie resurfaces. They float on their backs in the pool together, while Florentine dances at the party, oblivious to the effect that her actions have had upon Marie and Anne.
