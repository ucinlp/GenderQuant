Four hundred years ago, a young boy, the last survivor of a pirate attack commanded by the ruthless Kabai Sengh , is washed ashore on an island called Bengalla, where he swears to devote his life to the destruction of piracy, greed, cruelty, and injustice and in adulthood adopts the identity of "The Phantom", a masked avenger. The role of the Phantom is passed on from father to son through centuries, causing people to believe in a single, immortal figure and accordingly to nickname him "The Ghost Who Walks" and "The Man Who Never Dies". In 1938, Kit Walker , the 21st Phantom, finds the man who killed his father, the mercenary Quill , searching for one of the 'Skulls of Touganda', possession of which grants the owner a tremendous destructive power. The Phantom seizes Quill's men and saves the native kidnapped as their guide; but Quill retrieves the Skull and returns to the United States of America. In New York City, Kit's ex-girlfriend Diana Palmer  is sent by her Uncle Dave  to Bengalla in order to investigate claims that businessman Xander Drax , Quill's boss, is resorting to piracy. En route, Diana is captured by female "air-pirates" also obeying Drax, led by the femme fatale Sala . The Phantom, told of Diana's kidnapping by Capitain Phillip Horton , rescues Diana and escapes to his headquarters, the 'Skull Cave', where Diana meets with Captain Horton and is returned to New York. The Phantom then travels to New York in civilian guise to meet Diana. There, they locate the second Skull in a museum, but are captured by Drax and his men, who steal the second Skull and unite it with the first; thereupon to locate the third on a island on the Yellow Sea. Diana is taken there by Drax, Sala, and Quill, while Kit follows them as the Phantom. On the island, Drax meets with the pirate Kabai Sengh, who possesses the third Skull; and both are attacked by the Phantom. Quill is killed at close quarters, and Kabai Sengh by falling into a pool of sharks. Diana, Sala, and the Phantom co-operate to defeat the subordinate villains; whereupon Drax unites the three Skulls and turns them against the Phantom, only to be destroyed when the Phantom uses the skull marked on his own ring to overcome the others. In parting from Diana thereafter, the Phantom reveals his secret and his double-identity to her, with implication that she will therefore become his bride; but she is conveyed to New York by Sala, who does not see him exposed.
