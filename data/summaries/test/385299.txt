The story revolved around a typical household of a Nepalese village where a desperate young boy flees home to earn money and to alleviate agony of his poor widow mother. He served in a foreign army for a couple a years, returns home as a grown-up, energetic young man but only to find that his mother has died. The elders of the village persuade him to stay behind in the village and serve the community, reiterating the saying that “service to the motherland is equally virtuous as service to a mother”.
