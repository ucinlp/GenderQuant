The film revolves around four friends and their relationships with women. Set to the background of upscale Manhattan bars, lofts and apartments, the guys engage in sharp banter and one-upsmanship. The characters, Mark, a therapist ; Runyon, a playwright ; Josh, a playboy  and Phil, a plumber , try  to sort out their troubled love-lives. Mark and his girlfriend  are hung up over moving in together; Runyon is hung up over his old girlfriend Kathryn , who has moved to Los Angeles; the womanizing Josh is hung up on Phil's sister, Gina , who has an abusive husband; Phil, who is married with children, finds himself hung up on an English interior designer . The characters in the film spend much of their time trying to decipher the word "pompatus," wondering whether they are mis-hearing the lyrics: "Prophetess"? "Impetus"? "Profitless"? "Impotence"? "Pompous Ass"? Pom-pom tits?
