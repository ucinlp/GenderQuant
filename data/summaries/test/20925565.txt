The film's plot follows the adventures of June  and her friends who after their senior year of high school, agree to help June's uncle's failing gas and service station. However, right across the street is another station, one led by a devious businessman. His goal is to put his rival out of business. It seems like fate might be working in the villain's favor. Uncle Joe has been struck by a heart attack, and can no longer run the business. After Uncle Joe's doctor tells him he must sell the gasoline station that he's operated for more than twenty years, June decides to take over its management, and persuades her friends to work for her. The girls, serving as the station's gas pump attendants, wear abbreviated uniforms—halter tops and short shorts—one labeled "Regular" and the other "Super Duper" . Michael and his male friends work as mechanics in the station's body shop. June also installs a public address system, over which she announces the station's services, using sexually suggestive phrases and double entendres. Business is soon booming, much to Mr. Friendly's chagrin. The Vultures, a local motorcycle gang, vandalize June's station, but are soon recruited by her as she puts her feminine charms to work, and the toughs work as her tow truck driving team.  Mr. Friendly hires two mobsters to put June out of business—by killing her. The Mobsters are played by seasoned screen vets Mike Mazurski, and Joe E. Ross, best known for playing the loveable but bumbling police officer Toody on car 54, where are you. However, as they threaten her, she flips the switch on the PA system, alerting the others of her dilemma. Having returned from towing a vehicle, the Vultures hatch a plan: while the girls pace back and forth, topless, to distract the mobsters, the Vultures, waiting just outside the doorway to the station's office, will club the men over their heads with a board. First one, and then the other, mobster falls victim to the scheme, and is knocked unconscious. Next, Mr. Friendly convinces the gasoline supplier not to deliver supplies to June's station. Without a product to sell, the station is out of business, until June finds a way to get more fuel to sell: they visit their competitor, asking to have the gas tank of Michael's car filled. As the vehicle is refueled, one of the boys, hidden beneath the car, syphons the gasoline into a storage tank, so that the car seems to hold much more fuel than it needs. By making two visits, using the same vehicle, the friends are able to obtain more regular and high-octane gasoline to sell at their own station. This scheme is successful, but only for the near term, and they are soon out of product again. They are all about to admit defeat until Mr. Friendly pays them an unfriendly visit to mock their attempt to compete against him, and June rallies them.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077597/ She intercepts the fuel deliveryman, who tells her to follow him if she wants to see where the president of the fuel company works, but warns her that he refuses to see anyone but oil sheiks. June and her friends follow the deliveryman, but the security guard at the gate refuses to allow them to enter the company's property. June hits on a plan. The Vultures will don helmets, posing as a security force, and she and the other teens will dress as oil sheiks. This time, the guard permits them to enter, and they are ushered into the president's office. June removes her disguise, and, attracted to her in her brief uniform, the president listens to her story concerning how she and her friends have attempted to save her ailing uncle's family business, despite the unfair competition that Mr. Friendly has posed, which includes his having hired hit men to murder her. Outraged at Mr. Friendly's conduct, the president discontinues his franchise, and June takes over the Pyramid gas station and garage. Her uncle recovers and returns to manage the business, and June and her friends enjoy their post-graduation freedom.
