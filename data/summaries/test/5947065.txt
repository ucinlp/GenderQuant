The Shadow in The Whispering Shadow is the underworld mastermind. He has invented a device that allows him to kill by radio control. He, along with several other persons, seeks the Czar's jewels. The series is notable for the constant false clues and decoy actions that make nearly everybody a suspect. Despite being the voice of The Shadow, Lugosi is a red herring.<ref name Harmon | first  Donald F.
