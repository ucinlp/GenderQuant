Yosuke is a high school student in Tokyo, Japan. He spends most of his free time sitting outside near a floodgate and playing a short tune on his acoustic guitar - the same few notes every time. He is usually joined by a girl in his class, Yu, who simply sits near him and listens to his music. Yu has a crush on Yosuke but does not tell him. After listening to him play the guitar, she goes home and hums the notes to her older sister. Her older sister used to have a serious boyfriend, but he has died recently, and she is still mourning for him. One day, Yosuke asks Yu about her sister. He is attracted to Yu's sister, and Yu sets up a few meetings between them. He also gets Yu to wear her sister's old school uniform for a day. While talking with Yosuke after school, Yu finally kisses him, but Yosuke just walks away; Yu is left there, crying. Yosuke keeps meeting Yu's sister, but before one meeting, Yu's sister gets hit by a truck while walking over to see him. She goes into a coma. Yu and Yosuke visit her at the hospital, and on their way home, Yu tells Yosuke that she wants to hear his song on the guitar when he finishes it. The two do not see each other again for 17 years. During that time, Yosuke enters the music production business and eventually gives up his guitar playing. He lives alone in an apartment. One day, he sees an intoxicated woman lying in the street and a man standing over her. Yosuke stares at the man, presumably a robber, and the man walks away. Yosuke goes into the studio a few days later and listens as a woman records some music on her guitar. During a break in recording, she looks at him and plays a few notes from the song he made in his school days. He realizes that the woman is Yu. After catching up, the two go back to Yosuke's apartment and drink sake. Eventually, Yosuke asks about Yu's sister and finds out that she is still in a coma. Yu starts to cry, and Yosuke comforts her. They then kiss each other for the second time in their lives. Afterwards, they visit Yu's sister at the hospital, and Yu leaves at the train station. Yosuke looks her up in the phone book and calls to say that he wants to play the finished song for her. They set up a meeting. On the way there, Yosuke gets stabbed by the same man who before had planned to rob the drunk woman. Yosuke lies in the street, bleeding, while Yu waits for him. Yosuke ends up in the hospital. Yu sits there by his side, and when he finally regains consciousness, she whispers, "I love you." Yosuke then replies that he loves her, too.
