In the aftermath of global thermonuclear war, three battle tested women wage war in a virtual reality videogame against giant mutant sandwhales. All of them seek to kill "Madara Sunakujira" the game's end boss but find that despite their high levels, are unable to engage it alone as they wish, forcing them to form a party to defeat it together. "Gray," a sniper who travels flying in her own plane, "Lucifer," a black dress wearing girl who can turn into a giant crow and uses magic spells, "Colonel," a woman in burgundy armor who uses an FN FAL with M203, and "Jäger," a drifter who uses a powerful sniper rifle and relies on his luck . The four defeat Madara, but unfortunately for Jäger, only the first person to turn in the quest gets the points, all the girls having flying transports while he's left on foot. In anger Jäger shoots them all down and declares himself a "player killer," and all of them engage in a fire fight.
