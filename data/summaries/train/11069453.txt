The film concerns events one Sunday  in Bethnal Green, a part of the East End of London that is still suffering the effects of bombing and post-war deprivation. Rose Sandigate  is a former barmaid married to a middle-aged man ([[Edward Chapman  who has two teenage daughters from a previous marriage. She is a bossy, strident Bethnal Green housewife, coping with the difficulties of rationing, near-slum housing and a drab, joyless environment. A former lover ([[John McCallum , who was jailed years earlier for robbery with violence, escapes from prison and turns up at her door asking her to hide him until the heat is off. Rose initially refuses outright but, clearly still in love with him, her normal toughness dissolves and he persuades her to let him hide in the family's disused air raid shelter and then in a bedroom upstairs. However, it proves extremely difficult to keep the presence of the surprise guest a secret in such a busy, bustling household â€” particularly with her former lover intent on seducing her. It is Sunday morning and the lunch must be cooked, the girls admonished for their misdemeanours of the previous night and the husband packed off to the pub out of the way. The strain is intolerable and as the day progresses, the police net closes, after a nosey newspaper reporter guesses where the man is hiding. By nightfall her secret is out and a panic-stricken Rose tries to kill herself, while the prisoner once again flees, only to be cornered in railway sidings and arrested by the detective inspector ([[Jack Warner  who has been patiently tracking him.BritMovie accessed 5 May 2007
