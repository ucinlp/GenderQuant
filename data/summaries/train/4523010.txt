In 1958, the town of Centerville, Illinois was invaded by a race of aliens, who had the power to fire lasers from their eyes and hands, and could "crystallize" humans into glowing blue orbs. They took on the form of the humans who were either captured or, presumably, killed. Twenty five years later, university lecturer Charles Bigelow  learns that his ex-wife, Margaret Newman , has disappeared while attending her mother's funeral in Centerville, and travels there to find her. The disguised aliens are all dressed in 1950s clothing, and try to capture Bigelow as he escapes, but only capture his dog, Louie. Seeing a photo of an alien in a tabloid magazine, Bigelow soon finds Margaret, who is now revealed to be one of the aliens. She warns Bigelow to escape with Elizabeth , their human/alien hybrid daughter, to protect her from the aliens, who want to take her to their home-world. Bigelow and his daughter Elizabeth escape from the departing alien ship and the town-folk blue orbs are transformed back to their original human forms.
