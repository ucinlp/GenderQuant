Wayne Dobie  is a meek Chicago Police Department crime scene photographer who has spent years on the job without ever drawing his gun; his colleagues jokingly call him "Mad Dog". Mad Dog saves the life of mob boss Frank Milo  during a hold-up in a convenience store. Milo offers Mad Dog a gift in return: for one week, he will have the "personal services" of Glory , a young woman who works as a bartender at Milo's club. Mad Dog learns that Glory is trying to pay off a personal debt and wants nothing to do with Milo beyond that. After an awkward start, they fall in love. Mad Dog wants her to move into his apartment, but Milo has no intention of losing Glory permanently. Milo says that Mad Dog has to pay $40,000 to give Glory her freedom, and sends one of his thugs to back up this threat. Mad Dog's partner, Mike , fights the thug on Mad Dog's behalf. Mad Dog does his best to get the money but falls short by $12,500. Knowing that Mike can no longer fight his battles, he works up the courage to fight for Glory himself, and ends up fighting with Milo in the street. Fed up, Milo washes his hands of Mad Dog and lets Glory go with no strings attached.
