The part-time criminal Keek is in trouble, after losing most of the money on the horses. The money had originally been carried off a bank robbery, although this money actually belonged to his arrested friend Karl-Heinz "Kalle" Grabowski. Meanwhile in jail Kalle watches a porn-movie, shot by Keek’s friend Franky. When seeing his wife Manuela in the movie, Kalle goes crazy and escapes from prison. After killing Franky, the escaped Kalle unexpectedly appears at Keek’s door and demands his money. The next day, the alcoholic "Schlucke" is forced by his boss Werner Kampmann, to break into his transport company to pretend a burglary because of insurance fraud. Schlucke, however, has talked boastfully about his plan, so that Keek sees a chance to get the money for Kalle. Together with his friend Andy, Schlucke and Ratte  break into the company. Without hesitation, Keek and Andy rip the safe out of the building, by use of a chain attached to Keek’s car, and carry it away. The following day, Keek and Andy try to blackmail Kampmann with the documents from his safe. At the airport, while trying to fetch the money, Keek and Andy meet both Kampmann and Kalle. Suddendly, Kampmann is being shot by Kalle, who is killed by a plainclothes-policeman afterwards. As it turns out later, the stolen money was already taken away by a former apprentice of Kampmann, Melanie, who moved to Mallorca with a friend in the meantime.
