Though balancing those two worlds has its fair share of challenges, Kate generally manages to come out on top thanks to the support of her best friend, Allison , who's had plenty of experience balancing kids and a career. Meanwhile, on the other end of the spectrum, Kate's associate assistant, Momo , lives for her work and is afraid of settling down. Just when Kate lands a lucrative new account that will see her traveling across the country on a regular basis, however, her new business associate Jack  makes advances on her, and Richard receives a job offer he can't turn down.
