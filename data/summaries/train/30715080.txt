Prince Salim falls in love with Anarkali, a courtesan in his father Akbar's kingdom. Akbar forbids Salim to prolong this affair as he wanted his son to marry a Rajput princess and thereby strengthen communal harmony. So Akbar forbade Saleem from seeing Anarkali again. But Salim becomes blind in his love for Anarkali leading to a struggle between father and his adamant son. All the attempts of Akbar and Minister Man Singh to separate the lovers fail. Prince Saleem and Akbar had an argument that later became very serious that even he leads a campaign against his father. In the ensuing war Salim is defeated and sentenced to death. Empress Jodhabai begs to her husband Akbar for the life of their son. But the dutiful emperor does not accede to her request. Anarkali is sentenced to be buried alive. Salim escapes from the jail and rushes to save Anarkali from the punishment. But before he reaches the burial ground, Anarkali's punishment is execution.
