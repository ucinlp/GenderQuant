As the 19th Century nears an end, brother and sister Cosmo and Amy Grey have not seen their parents for many years, their father being a doctor who has been in Panama during work on the canal. Their housekeeper sends them to see a play, Peter Pan, but by mistake they end up seeing a rather sophisticated family drama instead. Robert and Alice Grey come home not sure what to expect. The children hardly know Alice at all. Furthermore, the play has given Amy some peculiar ideas of how mature grown-ups behave. When she hears Alice receive an invitation to meet Dr. Steven Clark, she falsely assumes they are having a romantic tryst. Amy shows up at Steve's unexpectedly, trying to talk him out of the "affair." He is forced to hide her in a closet when Alice shows up. Robert has been invited as well, but when a glove is found and Amy's presence revealed, everybody gets the wrong idea. Alice assumes the doctor is seeing her daughter, while Robert assumes the doctor is seeing his wife.
