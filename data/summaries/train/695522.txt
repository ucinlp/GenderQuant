The circus strongman , and the midget  are accomplices of the bad guy Carter ([[James Burke  who is trying to take over the circus. In the animal car, they knock Wilson  out and steal his $10,000 http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost11939&year2=2011. Groucho, as lawyer J. Cheever Loophole, arrives to handle the situation. He caves in when he sees Pendleton and makes an absolute fool of himself with Little Professor Atom.  In order to help Wilson, he first tries to get the money from Carter's moll, Peerless Pauline , but fails miserably. Then he calls on Mrs. Dukesbury , and cons her into paying $10,000 for the Wilson Circus to entertain the Newport 400, instead of a performance by an orchestra conducted by a Frenchman named Jardinet . The "400 of Newport" are delighted with the circus; when Jardinet arrives, Groucho, who also delayed Jardinet by implicating him in a "dope ring," disposes of the Frenchman and his orchestra by having them play on a floating bandstand down at the water's edge. Chico and Harpo cut the mooring rope and the musicians play the Prelude to Act Three of Lohengrin by Wagner, serenading the waves. Meanwile, Carter and his cronies try to burn down the circus, but are thwarted by the brothers, along with the only witness to the robbery - the gorilla , who also retrieves Wilson's ten thousand dollars.
