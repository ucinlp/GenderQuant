Family man Gene Courtier makes the mistake of picking up a hitch-hiker, Victor Gosset, a wanted criminal. Gosset and his accomplices, Robert Batsford and Luther Logan, take Courtier and his family captive in their home at gunpoint. They demand that Courtier sell the car in the morning and hand over the money. With police closing in, the gang refuses to leave. Courtier's father is a wealthy man, so the robbers now want a large sum in ransom. Courtier gets the best of them eventually, however, with all three of his kidnapers ending up dead.
