A groom and his four groomsmen wrestle with issues such as fatherhood, homosexuality, honesty and growing up in the week leading up to his wedding. Paulie , a self-supporting writer, is making plans for his marriage to Sue , his girlfriend who is in her 5th month of pregnancy. In real-life, Burns' then girlfriend, supermodel Christy Turlington, was also five months pregnant when they married in June 2003. Christy inspired Burns to re-work the manuscript for this movie, which he hadn't worked on in many months. Paulie is strongly advised by his older brother Jimbo  to not go through with the wedding. Jimbo, who runs a struggling business, is envious of Paulie, partly because his own childless marriage is unraveling. T.C. , who left the neighborhood without explanation eight years earlier, returns for the wedding. Apparently, before leaving, T.C. had stolen a Tom Seaver baseball card from Paulie's cousin Mike . Mike still harbors such resentment over the loss that he immediately starts a fight with T.C. Later, T.C. hesitantly reveals that he abruptly left the neighborhood because he's gay and that he stole Mike's card because, even though they were best friends, he hated him for his constant gay bashing. The neighborhood bar is owned by Dez , who is married with two children and is the most content and functional member of the gang. He is continually trying to "get the band back together". He has even pushed his own sons into learning the guitar and is seen riding them to become better. Jessica Capshaw has a small role in this film. Her stepfather, Steven Spielberg, directed Edward Burns in Saving Private Ryan.
