Set in Sydney's western suburbs, Footy Legends tells the story of Luc Vu , a young Vietnamese Australian man with an obsession about rugby league football. Out of work and with welfare authorities threatening to take away his little sister , because their parents are dead and Luc is deemed incapable of being a responsible guardian, Luc re-unites his old Yagoona High School "footy" team&mdash;whose members are now facing social problems such as long-term unemployment, drug addictions, the after-effects of teenage parenting&mdash;and wins a competition that offers a Holden Ute and a modelling job for Lowes Menswear as its prize. It is mostly comedy which is underpinned with serious social issues affecting western Sydney. The film features Vietnamese-language dialogue between Vu, Anne, and their aged grandfather.
