The story begins with the Pink Panther wanting to cross the street. He waits for a time, but the cross light doesn't turn green. A few minutes later, the traffic light turns green, displaying the word "March". As soon as he tries to cross, the light turns red, displaying the word "Halt". Then, he looks and sees no cars on the street, but the instant he sets foot on the street, it is full of cars. He then sees a "Senior Miss" shop. The Pink Panther disguises himself as an old woman, but, as he walks across the street, a motorcycle pulls forward onto his skirt, such that as he walks, the skirt, which is caught under the wheel, is ripped. The Pink Panther then disguises himself as an eagle by using a "Super Eagle Flying Suit", and tries to fly across the street, but his flight is broken by his crashing into a billboard that says, "Next Time Try The Train!" He then encounters a Pedestrian Crossing Club, where he meets a man  who gives him five plans for crossing the street, using a stick, using a horse, using a rocket, walking across an electric wire, shooting himself out of a cannon and building a walkway from high above . The Pink Panther is finally able to cross the street by dressing in a cat suit, accompanied by three kittens. Upon doing so, he sticks out his tongue at the cars in the street, and turns to walk away. He is then promptly hit by a falling piano.
