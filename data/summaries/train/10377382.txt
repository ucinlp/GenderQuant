Undergoing psychoanalysis by an Army psychiatrist , paralyzed Black war veteran Private Peter Moss  begins to walk again only when he confronts his fear of forever being an "outsider." The film uses flashback techniques to show Moss, an Engineer topography specialist assigned to a reconnaissance patrol who are clandestinely landed from a PT boat on a Japanese-held island in the South Pacific to prepare the island for a major amphibious landing. The patrol is led by a young major  and includes Moss's lifelong white friend Finch , whose death leaves him racked with guilt; redneck-bigot corporal T.J. ; and sturdy but troubled Sergeant Mingo . When the patrol is discovered Finch is left behind and captured by the Japanese who force him to cry out to the patrol. The dying Finch escapes and dies in Moss's arms. In a firefight with the Japanese, Mingo is wounded in the arm and Moss is unable to walk. T.J. carries Moss to the returning PT boat that covers the men with its twin .50 calibre machine guns. In the film's crucial scene, the doctor forces Moss to overcome his paralysis by yelling a racial slur. From this point on, Moss will never again kowtow to prejudice. Mingo and Moss decide to go into business together.
