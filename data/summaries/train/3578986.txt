Danny O'Neill, Fred Astaire, and Hank Taylor, Burgess Meredith, are friends and rival trumpeters, with The Perennials, a college band. Both of them have managed to prolong their college career, by failing seven years in a row. At a performance, Ellen Miller, Paulette Goddard, catches Danny and Hank's eye. She serves them, for her boss, a debt collector; but, the fast talkers soon have her working for them, as their manager. Tired of losing gigs to The Perennials new manager, Artie Shaw, playing himself, comes to woo Ellen away, as his booking manager. She tries to get Danny and Hank an audition for Shaw's band; but, their jealous hi-jinks get them both fired. Sick of interfering producers, Ellen nevertheless talks Shaw into letting J. Lester Chisholm, Charles Butterworth, back a concert. It looks like the gig is up, when Hank pretends to be Ellen's jealous husband, and then brother. But, talking fast, they get Chisholm back on board, and Danny's song, in the show. All they have to do is keep Chisholm and his mandolin, which he's insisting on playing in the concert, off key and out of time, away from Shaw, until after the show. The only question is whether Hank or Chisholm got the champagne glass with the sleeping pills. To Ellen's relief, Danny finally acts professionally, arranging his number, for the show, which Shaw says "has really grown up, into something special"; instead of like a perpetual sophomore; and, they're going to get married. Danny is head over heels, as the music starts; and, he successfully dance-conducts his own composition, secure in Ellen's affections.
