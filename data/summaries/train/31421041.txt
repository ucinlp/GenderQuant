In 1846, a large wagon train left Springfield, Illinois for California. In July of that year, following the advice of "The Emigrants' Guide to Oregon and California" written by a pro-emigration promoter named Lansford Hastings, the Donner party left the main body of emigrants to take a never before tried “shortcut” across the Great Basin. The Donner Party arrived at the foot of the Sierra Nevada, the last mountain pass before California weeks behind schedule and short of food. The first blizzard of the season started only one day before they planned to head up and over the Sierra Nevada. With 95% of their journey already completed, they would be forced to wait months to make the final push, enduring the Sierra Nevada's most unfavorable winter in history. The group was trapped on the eastern side of the Sierra for five months, culminating in death and cannibalism. Of the 87 men, women and children in the Donner Party only 46 survived to reach California.
