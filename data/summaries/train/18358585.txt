Popular American comedian Bob Hunter , star of stage, movies and television, boards the luxury liner SS ÃŽle de France to travel to France, only to find his French counterpart, Fernydel  is on the ship as well. Also on board are elegant blonde diplomat Ann McCall , whom Bob would like to get to know better, and stunning Zara Brown , the agent for a French criminal organization which suspects that Bob is carrying an incriminating manuscript. While Bob pursues Ann, with Fernydel's help, Zara repeatedly searches Bob's stateroom, causing problems when Ann sees her leaving after a search. When he reaches Paris, Bob visits Serge Vitry , a writer whose script Bob has come to purchase, but is told that Vitry is no longer interested in comedy: he is writing a true-life drama which he is going to produce himself. Bob pleads for a look, and is told where he can get a translated copy. A series of suspicious accidents and mishaps then leads to Bob being arrested as a suspect in the murder of Serge, but he is rescued by the American ambassador  and Inspector Dupont , who tell him that Serge used his manuscript to reveal the identities of counterfeiters who had infiltrated their way into high offices in the French government, which is why he was murdered. The two men ask Bob to serve as bait to flush out the criminals. Bob agrees, but only because Ann's life is also in danger. Helped by Ann, Fernandel, and villainess-turned-heroine Zara, Bob is chased all over Paris by the underworld, at one point winding up in a mental asylum for safekeeping. It all ends with an escape by helicopter piloted by Fernandel  reading a book of flight instructions, capture of a group of assassins, then a parade for Bob, Fernandel and Ann, who are heroes.TCM Full synopsis<ref nameavg&sql=1:37297~T0 Plot synopsis]Crawford, Rod Plot summary
