During the filming of a TV commercial for a "Meat For Go" campaign set in London's Smithfield Market, Steve, disillusioned by the inanity of his job, absconds in an E-type Jaguar  with a young actress/model, Dinah . After a visit to an open-air swimming-pool in central London and a memorable scene in and around the Great Conservatory in the grounds of Syon House, they make their way across a wintry southern England towards the island , off the coast of Devon, which Dinah is contemplating buying . This act of rebellion is cynically exploited by the advertising executive behind the campaign, Leon Zissell , who deputes two of his henchmen to pursue the fleeing couple. On their journey, Steve and Dinah encounter first a group of proto-hippies , and then an unhappily-married middle-aged couple  in the opulent surroundings of the Royal Crescent in Bath, Somerset.  Steve also plans to visit his boyhood hero, Louie ([[David Lodge , whose youth club in London's East End he attended, and who has since relocated to Devon. Having fled the police  after a fancy-dress party in the Roman Baths, Steve and Dinah  make their way towards Devon. Steve's encounter with Louie is disappointing. Louie recognises Dinah instantly  but fails to recognise Steve and misremembers his name, even after being introduced. Dinah's island also proves to be disappointing. At low tide it is reachable from the mainland, and Zissell  has already arrived.
