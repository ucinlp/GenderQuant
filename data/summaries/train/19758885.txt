This is another morality lesson in a long string of such films. After Slicker steals and Alfalfa is wrongfully accused of it, an angry Alfalfa decides to get even with his parents by embarking upon a life of crime. To that end, he enlists the other kids as his "mob." Hoping to deflect his pals from this drastic action, Spanky McFarland decides to teach the gang a lesson. He tricks the kids into thinking they're burglarizing a house, when in fact they're merely helping the homeowners clean out their junk. Things take an unexpected turn when a real-life fugitive from justice chooses the gang's clubhouse as his hideout, with the cops hot on his heels. Assuming they burgled a house, Alfalfa and the gang are caught by the police and confess they did the crime, not knowing what the real crime committed by a real criminal was. The next morning they are arraigned and Spanky comes in with Mrs. Wilson to explain what had really happened. Meanwhile, Slicker is being arraigned with his mother for what seems to be an unrelated crime. For Alfalfa, Spanky, and the rest of the gang, everything is solved.<ref namehttp://movies.nytimes.com/movie/226201/Good-Bad-Boys/overview |title2008-10-08|work=NY Times}}
