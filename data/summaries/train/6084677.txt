The film is essentially the story of a girl Roopa . She begins her day with classical music lessons for kids in her neighborhood followed by her day job in an ad-agency. Roopa loses her parents in a tragic accident and from then on has had to fend for things herself. Roopa is about to get married to her colleague in the ad-agency, Rahul, a rich marwari. Her close friend Anitha  worries that Roopa will have to compromise on her freedom after her marriage into the orthodox north Indian family. Her worries come true on the day of marriage when Rahul's mother makes a big deal about a trivial issue and Rahul doesn’t support Roopa. Roopa then realizes she will have to lose her individuality if she marries Rahul and takes a painful decision to call off the marriage. Into her life moves Anand, the son of an industrialist and its his father who is responsible for the accident that kills Roopa’s parents. His father, consumed by guilt, loses his mental balance. Anand brings his father to Roopa’s wedding without her knowledge and witnesses the events that lead to the marriage being called off. When he sees Roopa, he decides that Roopa is the woman for him. Anand leaves his studies in the US and decides to move into a room next to Roopa’s house. The attempt of the film was to juxtapose the very simple things in life one yearns for, like a beautiful early morning, a cool evening breeze, a chilly moon lit night or a beautiful rainy day, while sitting at your porch and relishing a hot cup of good coffee.
