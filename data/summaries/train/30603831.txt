Imam plays Hasanin, an uneducated man who leaves his small village to live with his uncle's family in the city. After having no luck keeping a job, he must return to his village. On the way, after getting kicked out of a mosque he tries to sleep at, he ends up in a homeless shelter that he discovers is actually run by a gang forcing people to beg in the streets after maiming them. Hasanin is set out to pose as if he is a blind beggar.Behbehani, Ali I. Letter to the Editor, Arab Times, Retrieved January 24, 2011
