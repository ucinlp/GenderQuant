Fikret  earns a living by selling roses on the Bosporus Bridge. He also tries working in a restaurant, but it is not an improvement. Umut  is a dolmuş driver on the Taksim-Bostancı route. He and his girlfriend struggle to pay their apartment rent from their combined wages. Murat  is traffic policeman on the Bosporus Bridge. He has dates with women he knows from chatting on internet. Some women are disappointed about his low wages. The lives and dreams of these three men who live in the ghettos of the big city intersect unknowingly every day with each others’ and those of millions of Istanbulites on the Bosporus Bridge, the heart of the city.
