Dave the Dude  is a successful, very superstitious New York City gangster who buys apples from street peddler Apple Annie  to bring him good luck. On the eve of a very important meeting, he finds Annie terribly upset. Annie, it turns out, has a daughter named Louise , who was sent to a school in Europe as a child, but is now a grown woman. Louise believes her mother to be wealthy socialite Mrs. E. Worthington Manville, and she is bringing her aristocratic fianc√© Carlos and his father, Count Alfonso Romero , to meet her. Annie has been pretending that she resides in a luxurious hotel  and has Louise's letters mailed there, then intercepted by a friend and handed over to her. Dave's good-hearted girlfriend Queenie Martin  persuades him to help Annie continue her charade. Queenie takes on the task of transforming the derelict into a dowager. Dave arranges for cultured pool hustler "Judge" Henry G. Blake ([[Thomas Mitchell  to pose as Annie's husband. He installs her in an out-of-town friend's suite in the hotel, complete with Hudgins , his friend's butler. When Dave keeps postponing a meeting with an extremely powerful gangster to help Annie, his right-hand man Joy Boy  becomes increasingly exasperated. Dave manages to engineer a lavish reception with New York's mayor and governor as guests. Louise and her impressed future husband and father-in-law return to Europe, none the wiser about her mother's real identity.
