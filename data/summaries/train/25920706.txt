A wild team of misfits think that they can make it big. What's a coach to do with a chronic nose-picker, a flatulent fielder, an out of control pitcher, a juvenile delinquent and the prettiest girl in the state? Turn this bunch of losers into a winning team! When their new coach enlists an unusual new teammate, it's a whole new ballgame as they band together to win their first championship, determined to prove that losers can be winners, too.
