Young musicians from Mozambique, who usually play Jazz, Funk and Hip Hop, join a group of old men who are stars of the Marrabenta, the traditional Mozambique folk music. Together they form a band called Mabulu and mix their different music styles. The “Old Glories”, as they are affectionately called by their fans, still live in Maputo and survive, as they have for the last fifty years, by singing songs that describe the sad and funny details of their everyday lives.
