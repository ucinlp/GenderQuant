In Nantes, Gabriel meets Ã‰milie. The two pass an evening together, and as they are about to part ways, Gabriel asks her for a kiss. She refuses, and explains by telling him a story: In Paris, her friend Judith, happily married, has a childhood friend, Nicolas, who she still sees regularly. One day, as a solution to his lack of physical affection, Nicolas asks Judith for a platonic kiss. She accepts, and subsequently what should have been a simple act between friends without consequences becomes complicated, and the situation quickly becomes out of control.
