In the course of 9 minutes, Grasshoppers takes us through the following parts of history: * The discovery of fire, and the development of tools and weapons, which Modern Man uses to remove the threat of the larger but less intelligent Neanderthal; * Ancient Egypt: an animal worshipper clashes with a sun-worshipper; * A tragedy in Ancient Greece, where a dancer and a musician fall in love and are killed by a king, who is then attacked and defeated by the Roman Empire; * The Roman Empire, represented by a single "Caesar-like" figure, who repeatedly sends troops off to plunder the cultures at the fringes of the empire, until they eventually come back to defeat the now lazy, unprepared later Empire. The birth of Jesus Christ is also alluded to, but it only distracts the warring parties for a split second; * The continual fight for supremacy between the monarchies of medieval Western Europe; * The rise of Islam, leading eventually to the Crusades; * Genghis Khan's siege of China, and the construction of the Great Wall; * The Spanish conquest of the Americas; * The French Revolution; * The British/French Wars ; * The American Revolution; * The Napoleonic Wars; * The United States' systematic removal of Native Americans; * World War II and Nazi Germany, which leads to the Nuclear Age ; * Recent years, up to the present day , which encompasses the Cold War, the Vietnam and/or Korean Wars, and the continual skirmishing that occurs still today, between all manner of nations, organizations, and individuals. As the centuries  pass, the pace of the animation grows gradually faster and more frantic. At the beginning and end of the cartoon, and occasionally in between vignettes, the cartoon abandons the struggles of humanity to focus briefly on a shot of grass growing and insects buzzing over the ruins of previous battles. In the final shot, the camera finally zooms in tighter on the grass to allow us to glimpse two grasshoppers happily mating.
