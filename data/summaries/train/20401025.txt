The film begins in a church on the edge of a forest, which is home to "The Blesseds." Inside the church, Mary Catheter is requesting a trip outside the church. Father Catheter, her father and head priest of "The Blesseds," will not allow the request because he fears it will be too dangerous. Mary questions her fatherâ€™s judgment, so Father Catheter and Mother Grizzard begin a hip-hop musical number, Who Begat, about the lineage of The Blesseds . The focus of the narrative then turns to "The Beasties," who dwell in the forest near the church. A "Beastie" named Flippy asks another "Beastie," Wog Wog, how the Beasties came into existence. Wog Wog sings a song that depicts the history of their race . At the conclusion of the song, Queen Bonobo, queen of "The Beasties," is informed that her husband, Chief Cranius, has been killed by "The Blesseds." "The Beasties" exit the forest in search of revenge. Back at the church, Father Catheter explains to how he had gone into the woods, and killed the leader of "The Beasties." It is at this point that "The Beasties" burst into the church and attack. This is also when the love story between Mary and Wog Wog begins. The sequence ends with Queen Bonobo taking Mary hostage in retribution for killing their chief. "The Blesseds" find "The Beasties" in the forest and the two groups close in on each other. But before they meet, Jesus (played by [[Sean Hayes , appears and persuades his followers not to choose a path of violence. "The Beasties" take advantage of this opportunity, and close in on "The Blesseds." At this point, Charles Darwin, appears and stops "The Beasties" in a similar fashion. The two groups make amends momentarily, but resume fighting when they see Jesus and Darwin fighting. Wog Wog and Mary flee to the ocean.
