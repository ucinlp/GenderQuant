The titular character in the story is Ambikapathy , the son of the Tamil poet Kambar  who is in love with the Chola princess and daughter of Kulothunga Chola, Amaravati . The king objects to their love and insists on testing Ambikapathy's literary mettle before judging his worth. The test given to Ambikapathi is that he should write and sing a hundred poems in the field of Puram . The poems should not have any reference to the field of Aram . Ambikapathi begins the test in the King's court with a Kadavul Vaazhthu. Amaravathi who is keeping the count, mistakes the invocation as a poem and counts it as poem number one. When he has sung only ninety nine Puram poems, she thinks he has completed the task and signals him that hundred poems have been sung. Declaring victory, Ambikapathy sings of his love for her and thus fails the test. He is executed by the king.
