Raghavan alias Raghu has been ignored and demeaned all his life. He then decides to teach the world a lesson, by printing the best ever fake currency notes. This does get him some conditional recognition by a gangster named Bardha. But Raghavan's goal is much more higher than getting some recognition, and his plans materialize when he is able to get Bardha killed, and takes over as the unchallenged leader of the underworld. Raghavan decides to put a temporary halt to all criminal operations when he comes to know that his brother-in-law, Asst. Superindent of Police, Raj Sinha, along with his wife, Suman, her mother, and his young son, Bunty, are coming over for a visit. Raghavan's instructions are not followed, and Raj comes to know that Raghavan is the head of this crime syndicate. Raghavan then decides to use his position and abducts Suman, her mother, and Bunty, and uses them as a shield against Raj. But Raj is bent upon capturing Raghavan by any means possible, and as a result, Suman and her mother are killed. Now the only one left alive from Sinha family is Bunty, but if Raj continues to pursue Raghavan, it does not look like Bunty will be alive for very long.
