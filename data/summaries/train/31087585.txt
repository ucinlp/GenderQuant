This naturally upsets his family members: his dadi and elder brothers Amar and Ravi who care and worry for him. Constantly troubled by lack of money, the family has lots of problems. Ravi's pending IAS examination was the core problem they were facing. To raise money for the examination, Raja and his friends take up a job, one that entailed getting rid of a tenant who had illegally settled in a house. Raja had an easy time getting rid of Shalu. But from then on, Shalu creates hell for him and moves into his house and life permanently. Tejpal and Nagpal were power brokers. They were very influential and intimidating. They succeed in getting Ritu married to Ravi, now an IAS officer, on the threshold of becoming a collector. A perfect move thought the villains &mdash; Saxena's sister married to Raja's brother. Raja revolts but is cornered. He has many clashes with the duo. In one of these clashes Raja's friends and eldest brother Amar are murdered. All is lost until Raja and Ravi discover the truth about Tejpal and Nagpal. Raja and Ravi decide to end the Gundaraj.
