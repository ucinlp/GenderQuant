In Northern Italy in 1944, the entire population of the village of Reanoto is massacred by the SS for helping the Italian resistance movement. The only survivors are a group of young boys in ages from 7 to 14 led by Aldo  who witness the mass execution and vow revenge. That night, a detachment of US Army paratrooper saboteurs jump into the area with a mission to destroy a strategic dam with the partisans prior to the Fifth United States Army's advance into the area. Their drop zone has been discovered by the Germans, who kill them all except the leader of the paratroopers, Captain Turner , who is rendered unconscious and goes unnoticed by the Germans when he lands in the branches of a tree. The Germans capture the demolition equipment from the dead Americans. Aldo and his friends rescue Turner by spiriting him away from the ambush. Realising that Turner needs medical attention, they kidnap a German female doctor  to nurse him to health, and keeping her captive even after Turner's recovery. In order to avenge the massacre, Aldo wants the American Captain to train him and his friends in the use of military weapons and tactics. Turner uses the opportunity as a second chance to complete his sabotage mission, using the boys instead of his late command. He has the boys steal the captured American demolition gear from the Germans, but Aldo hides the detonators until Turner leads them in their revenge. Turner and his "Dead End Kids" are pursued by Wehrmacht Captain Von Hecht , a professional soldier who is against the methods of the SS, which he considers to be counter-productive.
