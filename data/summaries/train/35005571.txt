Winners introduces us to WIN, a project set in place by the Spanish Red Cross in Liberia, with a program to integrate vulnerable women in Monrovia into the social and labor fields. More than fourteen years of wars have relegated these women to the lowest rung of the social ladder of the already fragile Liberian society, turning them into the perfect victims of a gender violence that could well become an institution.
