 Dasima  is a nyai, or a native mistress, for the Englishman Edward William. The couple and their daughter Nancy live in a home near Gambir Square in Batavia . The delman driver Samiun has fallen in love with Dasima, despite already being married to Hayati. He attempts to use spells to win her heart. He also has an egg merchant, Mak Buyung, frighten Dasima by telling the young woman that she has committed the sin of zina . Samiun eventually succeeds, and Dasima goes to live with him and Hayati, taking along gold and jewels. Hayati has agreed to let Samiun take a second wife as she wants Dasima's money, which she will use for gambling.  Dasima eventually realises that she has been tricked and begins to keep a close eye on her remaining wealth. To get at it, Samiun calls the thug Puasa and tells him to rob the young woman. At night, as Dasima goes to hear the story of Amir Hamzah at a nearby village, Puasa accosts her. He panics when she screams and kills her, then throws her body off a bridge; it washes up behind Williams' home. Samiun and Puasa are caught and sentenced to hang.
