Kali, Shankar and Tithi are the three motherless children of the acting priest of a local Krishna temple in an anonymous small town/village in West Bengal. The local MLA Debu Soren’s henchmen kill their father because he insists on standing witness in court against a murder committed at Soren’s behest. Kali, the elder brother, kills the corrupt lawyer as he walks out of the courtroom after the judge has delivered his judgement. Kali goes to jail for ten years. Shankar meets with a freak accident and is brought up by a local Muslim fakir. But the accident has left him with a memory loss and a penchant for violence. He grows up to be one of Debu Soren’s favourite henchmen. The little girl Tithi, who is picked off the streets by the maid of Debu’s mistress, grows up to become a wayward girl on the verge of turning alcoholic. After ten long years, Kali is released. He returns to the temple to meet his grandfather who was away when Kali’s father was killed. The grandfather, a temple priest, encourages the grandson to avenge his father’s death. Kali, Shankar and Tithi are united and from then on, it is one long chain networking of maramari, dishoom-dishoom, blood and gore and the killing of the criminals one after the other in the same way their father was killed - by electric shock. The two young men come home to roost and it is one big happy family in the temple with their two girlfriends pitching in and Tithi hoping to tie the knot with the handsome young police officer.
