In Montauban in 1944, during the German retreat from France, Julien Dandieu is an ageing, embittered surgeon in the local hospital. Frightened by the German army entering Montauban, Dandieu asks his friend Francois to drive his wife and his daughter to the remote village where he owns a chateau. One week later, Dandieu sets off to meet them for the weekend, but the Germans have now occupied the village. His daughter and wife, who was raped, were both killed by the cruel Germans soldiers who shot his young daughter and immolated his wife with a flame-thrower. Dandieu decides to kill as many Germans as possible to avenge his family. He takes an old gun he used as a child while hunting with his father and starts to kill them one by one. They begin to think they are surrounded by many partisans and don't realise that he is, in fact, the only one, taking advantage of his knowledge of the secret passages within the chateau. He beats one of the SS men to death, shoots some of them and lets two of them drown in the well, where he closes the grid, preventing them from escaping. With no more cartridges for the shotgun, he finds the flame-thrower which killed his beloved wife and uses it to kill the SS officer as he is about to commit suicide standing in front of the 2-way mirror. The film ends with the liberation of the place by the French Resistance.
