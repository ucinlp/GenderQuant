Taken to extremes, what are the consequences of always pleasing others? Alex, a young photographer, continually seduces. He pleases everyone, without ever having any of his own ideas, passions, or conflicts. His existence is completely empty, dependent on the need to please others. While in Montr√©al, he has an adventure with a journalist, Marie, who is in the company of his best friend. This friend, Sara, is deaf-mute. Alex's disability is less obvious.
