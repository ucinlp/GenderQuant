But on questioning, his mother reveals that she was part of a large family  but had been sent out of the family after deciding to wed someone of her own choice. Ajith travels to the village as Karan's friend and soon endears himself to the members of his family. Turns out Malavika is the daughter of one of the brothers too. But when he learns that Karan wishes to marry her, he decides to bow out. But Karan, on knowing about their romance, wishes that they get together. The family elders too agree to Ajith marrying Malavika but refuse to let the alliance go any further after learning that Ajith is Srividya's son.
