Poet Yusuf learns about the death of his mother Zehra and goes back to his hometown, Tire, where he had not been for years. In his mother's house, a young girl, his cousin. Ayla, awaits him. Yusuf had not been aware of Ayla, who had been living with his mother for five years. Ayla conveys Yusuf Zehra's pledge to sacrifice a lamb after her death and tells Yusuf that he has to carry out his mother's wishes. Gradually he succumbs to the memories in the house, and the rhythms of the town, its inhabitants, and the spaces filled with ghosts. Yusuf and Ayla set off for a saint's tomb, a couple of hours away, for the religious sacrifice ceremony that his mother had pledged. Arriving after the herd from which they had planned to purchase a lamb has gone into the mountains to graze, they are forced to spend the night in a hotel by a nearby crater lake. A wedding ceremony held at the hotel brings Yusuf and Ayla closer.
