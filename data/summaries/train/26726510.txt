Mr. Tucker , proprietor of a Los Angeles coffee house, hires three down-on-their-luck patrons - out-of-work actor John Mapes ; struggling writer Ray Miller ; and George Leland , the wayward son of a movie star - to participate in an armored car robbery to take place during a four-hour stopover in Chicago during the trio's train trip from Los Angeles to New York. Tucker and his henchman Sidney  fly ahead to set up the robbery, which goes off without a hitch. However, once back on the train, Leland's greed gets the better of him, but Tucker double crosses the trio, eliminating Leland and Miller, leaving Mapes as the only one left to stop Tucker from getting away with murder - along with the entire haul.
