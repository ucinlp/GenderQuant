Leelatharan, Lee to his friends , hangs out with a bunch of merry youth who do practically any work and play football in other times. It is a strong-willed and thick-tied group. Chellam , a worker in a facility for the mentally-challenged, is also kind of a groupie. Life is all merry and mirth till she espies Lee & co, attempting an assassination of sorts on a Minister. The bid fails, but Chellam is shocked and so are we. Why would this bunch want to take a crack at the murky world of politics? Well, the answer unspools back into a college where Lee and his team are raring to go as footballers. They have a committed mentor in Butthiran . Though a coach, he is a friend, philosopher and guide kind of omnibus figure for the youngsters. Just when the boys are making the right progress, problem erupts in the form of Rangabashyam . He is a scumbag, but is also the principal of the college and he wants his son to be in this all-conquering team. The coach, with Chappellesque firmness, says no to this and wants to pick his team on merit. But the principal kicks out the team with its coach out of the college itself. So they gravitate towards another college and again start doing well as a team. And when they win a big and prestigious tournament, Rangabashyam throws up a major spanner in the works. He scuttles the rise of Lee and co. The stifling is so bad that one member commits suicide and the team slowly disintegrates, while on the other hand, Rangabashyam rises up in the big bad world of politics. He ends up as a Minister. Now the circle is complete. So the question, what happens to the rivalry of Rangabashyam and Lee and his team. And does Chellam understand the rationale behind Leeâ€™s actions?
