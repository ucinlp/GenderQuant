This serial shows as the trading post of Sitkawan, Canada is taken by surprise when an Indian tribe attack and massacre the settlers aboard a fur-bearing wagon train. Sergeant MacLane of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is assigned to investigate the case. MacLane soon realise that the attackers were led by Mort Ransome, a nasty renegade, who had been conspiring with Black Bear, medicine man of the tribe, to incite the heretofore friendly tribe for his own gain. He also learns that two white renegades have kidnapped Diana Blake, daughter of the local post factor, and saves her from a runaway wagon just before it plunges over a cliff. Perils of the Royal Mounted also features stereotypically Northern genre elements including trappers, lumberjacks, trading posts, rebellious braves, forest fires, avalanches, and a wide range of dangerous wildlife.
