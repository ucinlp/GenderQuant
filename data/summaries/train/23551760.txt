The film is about Tegan, a 12 year old student who finds out where meat comes from, and decides to become a vegetarian. She must contend with Elenore the Carnivore. The plot is based partly on the experience of the director, Marisa Martin, who became a vegetarian when she was 12 after visiting an abattoir.http://www.eormedia.com.au/films/teganthevegan/teganthevegan_images/articles/Relax_Mag_Filmmakers_p4.pdf Behind the Lens, The Canberra Times, 15 February 2009
