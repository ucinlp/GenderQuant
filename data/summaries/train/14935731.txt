Emily wakes up one morning only to discover that her world has been turned upside-down. Quite literally actually, as she wakes up on the ceiling of her apartment! Just when things seem like they couldn't get any worse, down-to-earth Simon arrives to take Emily on a date; a date she has completely forgotten about. Now they're not only trying to figure out this bizarre, existential problem, but are really testing the theory that opposites do indeed attract.Kevin Krikst http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1377811/plotsummary
