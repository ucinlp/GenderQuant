During the winter of 1846, a group of ill-fated pioneers, known as the Donner Party, were on their way to California through a newly discovered mountain pass. They encountered the worst blizzard ever recorded, trapping them with little food or shelter. The story begins in 2008 as six friends arrive at an isolated cabin to enjoy a long weekend in the snow. An epic snowstorm interrupts their vacation, trapping them on the mountain and resurrecting the haunting ghosts of the Donner Party. They struggle to find out whether these are the true demonic 'entities' or if it is simply 'cabin fever' that is bringing out their fears and paranoia, causing friends to turn against each other as their reality deteriorates around them.
