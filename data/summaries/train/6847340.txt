He then flees as the police and a reporter, Frank Briggs , set out to track him down. Morder eventually escapes, by pretending to be insane, into an asylum. Though here the patients has managed to free themselves, lock up the guards, and take charge . After Morder's final escape, he turns up as president of a secret Suicide Club . The film, which succeeds as it was intended, as a parody of the golden age of German expressionist cinema (in particularly Paul Leni's [[Waxworks , helped by the presence of Wegener, himself the star of two of the genre's high points, The Golem  and Alraune . It remains on many short-lists of forgotten classics of German cinema.
