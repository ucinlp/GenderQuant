Five friends, Rajiv , Ishita , Jai , Monica  and Manish , get drunk on their last day in college, and place a bet of Rs.200 among themselves, each claiming she/he will be the happiest in life. They give each other five years to win the bet. Rajiv says happiness means success. He becomes the best enterpreneur of the country. Jai thinks happiness means power. He becomes the youngest member of the Parliament. Monica says happiness means fame. She becomes a leading actress. Ishita thinks happiness means money. She marries a business tycoon. Manish is not a part of the bet. He wants plain happiness, which comes by itself. He keeps the bet amount with himself, and is to judge the winner after five years.
