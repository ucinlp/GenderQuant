Biswaprakash, a young man in his early twenties is a rebel revolting constantly against the obscure traditional oriental lifestyle of his family rooted deeply in the medieval socio-religious mores. A misfit for the consumerist culture of a society where the value system is changing at a faster pace, he is alienated from his family and friends. While so many questions relating to society, sex and morality intrigue him, Anjali, an independent, liberated and down-to-earth young woman enters his life. She strives to convert their mansion-like house into a holiday home besides looking after her paralysed mother, all alone. The friendship between Biswa and Anjali flourish amidst severe twists and turns till a policeman intervenes and breaks up the relationship. A disheartened Biswa turns to religious rituals in despair with the belief to redeem himself of the misery. And then, one day, another woman enters his life this time June, a young lady traveller from abroad. Biswa befriends June and in her, he finds a new hope of escaping the claustrophobia. But a time comes when June deserts him for a new destination leaving Biswa utterly lonely and trapped in a situation of no return.
