The Pink Panther walks slowly in the military aircraft grounds to the X-13 airplane under military personnel only. The panther gets into the plane looking at all of the random stuff, then pressed the automatic speed button to let the plane run by itself into maximum overdrive. The plane runs into the people, then the plane comes back and run into them again. The cars come from the tunnel, but the panther didn't look when the plane got into the tunnel, and the cars went backwards. Then at the ending, the panther ejected the seat and the parachute was launched. The military whistle blew and the military gentlemen chased after the Pink Panther.
