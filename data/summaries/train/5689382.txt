Laurel and Hardy establish an electrical goods store next door to Charlie Hall's grocery store. Hall, still sulking and suspicious from their previous encounter with the liquor-spiked well-water in Them Thar Hills, mistakenly thinks that Hardy is making advances towards his wife , and destroys a few items in Stan and Ollie's shop. Stan and Ollie leave their shop, without closing their door, to wreak havoc in Hall's grocery; while they are there, a shoplifter removes items from their store, taking more and more as their confrontations with Hall escalate . A policeman eventually comes and straightens out the brouhaha, but when Laurel and Hardy return to their store, there's nothing left: the shoplifter has returned a final time with a huge moving-van, and taken everything away.
