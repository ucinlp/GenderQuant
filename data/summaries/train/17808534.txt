Woody is sifting through some travel magazines when he spots a tempting ad for the "Swiss Chard" Lodge. The lodge is situated in Idaho, and promises lots of good food waiting for its guests. Woody is ecstatic, and promptly books a train ticket. After disembarking at the train station at "Sunstroke Valley", it becomes apparent that the lodge is still an additional 40 miles, with no adjacent roads or any form of transportation. Woody decides to take matters into his own hands by taking "a short cut," skiing and singing his way through the mountains. Upon Woody's arrival, lodge owner Wally Walrus  advises that there are "no accommodations without a reservation." Woody, of course, did not bother to inquire about such a rule. Drawn by the aroma of the warm food inside the lodge, Woody gains entry by disguising himself as Santa Claus. Wally is so excited at the prospect of Kris Kringle arriving that he quickly adorns the lodge with Christmas decorations. It does not take long, though, for the skeptical walrus to discover that it is, in fact, only October, making Santa's arrival somewhat premature. Woody manages to stuff his Santa toy sack with plenty of food from the lodge, and starts singing and skiing his way down the mountain. However, upon opening the sack, Woody discovers a vengeful Wally Walrus who wrings the little woodpecker's neck in disgust and mocks Woody's "ha-ha-ha-HA-ha".lantz.goldenagecartoons.com  Ski for Two is best known for Woody's rendition of the Ivor Tchervanow/Richard Kountz composition "The Sleigh", which he belts out while skiing to and from the Swiss Chard Lodge. Lyrics are as follows: **Lightly flying o'er snow **Ah hey yap yap yap yap yap yap **With sleighbells ringing, gaily singing **Merrily we go **All the world's a blanket white **Of snow so cold and crisp and light **With sharp winds blowing, we are going **Onward through the night **Aye, ah, oh, ah! **Aye, ah, oh, ah! **Lightly flying o'er snow. **Ah hey yap yap yap yap yap yap **Ochi chornyye, ochi strastnyye (in Russian: Очи черные, очи страстные (first line from [[Dark_Eyes_ **Merrily we go  **Oh ah oh, merrily on we go **Oh ah oh, merrily on we go **Ha ha ha ha ha ha, higher **Ha ha ha, higher higher higher higher! youtube.com comments
