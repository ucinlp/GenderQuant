In 1869, anxious to be more than a tramp telegraph operator, Edison  travels to New York at the prompting of an old friend, Bunt Cavatt . He goes to work for Mr. Els . He tries to persuade financier Mr. Taggart  to fund the development of his inventions, but Taggart has no interest in financing “green electrical workers”. However, General Powell , the president of Western Union, does. Edison eventually sells an invention to Taggart and Powell for $40,000, enabling him to get married and open his own “invention factory” at Menlo Park. In the next few years, he perfects the phonograph with his devoted staff. Trouble arises when Bunt brags to reporters that Edison has invented the electric light. Since he hasn't yet, he is condemned by the scientific community . Edison “leaves science behind”, and with a Herculean trial-and-error effort, finally succeeds in inventing a practical electric light. His subsequent plans to light New York are again hindered by Taggart, who arranges it so that Edison is only given six months to complete the entire task. Nevertheless, Edison finishes the job just in time.
