Jonas Nightengale is a faith healer, loosely based on televangelist Peter Popoff, who makes a living traveling across America holding revival meetings and conducting 'miracles.' He is helped by his friend and manager Jane and an entourage of fellow con artists. One of their trucks breaks down in Rustwater, Kansas, a town suffering a drought and in desperate need of rain to save their crops. While waiting for spare parts, Jonas decides to hold revival meetings just outside of town. Local sheriff Will Braverman is skeptical and tries to prevent his townspeople from being conned. However, Boyd, a disabled boy, believes Jonas could make him walk again. The events that follow make Jonas re-examine his own faith and doubts.
