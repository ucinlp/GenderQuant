Although one of Federal Airlines "ace" pilots, Chick Faber  is grounded by Flight Superintendent Bill Graves  when a doctor finds his eyesight is failing. Aided by stewardess Mary Norvell  and he friend, Nan Hudson , Graves persuades Chick to take a job as teacher in the school for stewardesses. While he remains at the airline, along with engineer, Artie Dixon , he continues work on the design of a secret research aircraft, he calls the "stratosphere ship" that will revolutionize commercial aviation by flying faster and higher than any current type. After Farber and Norvell get married, he finds that teaching is too restrictive and yearns to get back to his secret project. When he learns that the US Army Air Forces is going to test his aircraft, he attempts to get permission to make the first flight, but is refused due to his failing eyesight. Coming back after hours, Farber takes off and puts his secret aircraft through a high altitude test although Graves warns him by radio that the aircraft is too dangerous to fly without further development. At height, windows blow in and Farber barely recovers from going unconscious and pulling out of a high-speed dive, to make a crash landing back at his base. Angrily giving up his pilot's license, he decides to leave his wife and attempt to join the newly formed Chinese mercenary air force flying against Japan. US Army officers intercept him in San Francisco and enlist him back into the military in order to keep the secret of his "stratosphere ship" in US hands. Graves arranges for his wife to meet the newly enlisted Lt. Farber, now a flight instructor, with the reunited couple finally at peace, knowing that everything will turn out all right.The formation of the Flying Tigers is only hinted at.
