Daniel  and Laura  are a young couple vacationing in Morocco. They rent an off-road vehicle for a day trip to the desert. At a gas station they meet a shady stranger , who offers them to show them the desert. Declining his offer the two continue their trip and spontaneously decide to veer off the road.
