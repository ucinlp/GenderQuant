Kingdom Come is a story of a family , living out in the country, who come together after the death of a family member, whom no one seems to remember with much fondness. It is based on the Off-Broadway play Dearly Departed. First, there's Woodrow "Bud" Slocumb, the man in question, whose wife, Raynelle , is pretty nonchalant about his death from a stroke. Then there's Ray Bud , a recovering alcoholic who has a problem with seeing his father dead because of their rocky relationship. His wife, Lucille , is a loving, devoted housewife who goes out of her way to make sure that everyone has everything they need. But she can't have the one thing she wants out of life: a child. Next, Junior  has blown all of his money on a failed invention, and his loud-mouthed wife Charisse  is no help. She hits the roof after his infidelity and reminds him often that she could have been married to his rich lawyer cousin . There's Marguerite  a pious, overbearing mom who usually calls her son "Demon Seed"; she fears that he will end up in jail like his brother. Her son Royce  is an unemployed worker who is irritated by his mother's unsolicited and shrill advice on how to live his life.
