Unable to face her guilt over inheriting a morally questionable company when she turns 18, Anne runs away into the lawless wasteland of New York’s Bronx, described as: “In the year 1990 the Bronx is officially declared No Man’s Land. The authorities give up all attempts to restore law and order. From then on the area is ruled by the Riders”. Attacked by a roller skating gang called The Zombies, Anne is saved by members of The Riders and taken under the protection of The Riders’ leader Trash . The Manhattan Corporation hires a ruthless and psychopathic mercenary named Hammer  who turns the various Bronx gangs against each other to ensure Anne is returned.
