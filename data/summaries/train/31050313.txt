The film picks up where Dirk Longstreet left off in part 2. It seems like his girlfriend did not survive that coma she was put in by that film's villain, and Dirk has given up, living a nomadic lifestyle completely off the grid out of his van, searching for the next great wave to ride. He supplements this lifestyle through illegal underground fighting, which we see at the beginning. Anyway, while surfing, a young girl who was sold by her step-dad to white slavers escapes to the beach, Gruner saves her, and a bond forms. When she's captured, Gruner must fight again to save her. Of course, what he does not know is his wife is actually alive, but his off-the-grid life means no one can tell him.
