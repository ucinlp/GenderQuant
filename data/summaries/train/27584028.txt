A young woman fashion photographer known only as O is taken by her lover René to Château Roissy, where she is subject to various sexual sadomasochistic rituals. She leaves wearing a ring as a sign of her initiation. O meets a model called Jacqueline whilst René introduces O to Sir Stephen H, who was raised as René's brother, and the two men share O. Jacqueline moves into O's flat, and is seduced by her. O is then sent by Sir Stephen to the country house of Anne-Marie where she and other young women are prepared to be branded by Sir Stephen. O's visit concludes with Sir Stephen's inserting rings into her labia and being branded with his initials. Sir Stephen then shares her with two other men, the commander and Ivan. Later Sir Stephen, O, Jacqueline and René visit the commander's home in Brittany for a party and O takes Jacqueline to Roissy. Finally, Sir Stephen confesses to O he would endure the same punishments and she brands his hand with a hot cigar holder, leaving there a circle, or an O.
