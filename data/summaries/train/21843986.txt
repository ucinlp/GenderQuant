Asiemut chronicles the 8000&nbsp;km journey of Olivier Higgins and Mélanie Carrier. Riding their bicycles and pedaling through Asia, Olivier and Mélanie traveled from Mongolia to Kolkata, at the mouth of the Ganges in India, passing through Xinjiang, the Taklamakan Desert, Tibet and Nepal. Along the way, they discover the world, but over all, they discover themselves. Who are they? What do they want? What is their place in this world? Maybe, between the encounters, obstacles and the discovery, this daring journey made them reflect... Do we not all have a common "Asiemut"?
