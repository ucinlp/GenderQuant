Communist conspiracies seem to be everywhere in the 1950s, particularly in Washington, D.C., where word has reached John Rogers, the secretary of the U.S. Navy, that one of his subordinates is strongly suspected to be a Communist sympathizer. Bernie Goldsmith has no idea that he is the man in question as he enjoys his daughter's school essay on patriotism. The news that he is being suspended from work and investigated comes as a complete shock to him. Friends and neighbors, including a minister and the mayor, rally to Bernie's side after others begin to shun him. Joe DiMarco agrees to represent him in court, where a female lieutenant, Mary Jane McCoy, paints a suspicious picture of Bernie in the Navy's eyes. Joe's diligent work results in conclusive testimony that Bernie is not a Communist and all charges against him are dismissed. A grateful Bernie can't wait to be reinstated at work. Secretary Rogers, however, has stubbornly decided that he still cannot trust the man after everything he has heard. Months go by, with Bernie unable to find gainful employment with the Navy or anyplace else. Those who believe in Bernie go to great lengths again to get the Secretary to finally apologize and restore an innocent man's good name.
