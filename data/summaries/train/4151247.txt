Two queens have a fight: Bibbo, a Bollywood fashion designer: loud, raucous and vitriolic. Shabbo, a dancer: soft, sensuous, and equally malicious! Two fading queens in their late thirties - passionate, desperate and devastating. Call them sisters or mother & daughter their bonding is unique a bonding that is as shifty as their flights of fancy. One moment they would be bitchy and clawing at each other like alley cats, but the next moment they would reach out to each other as only two sensitive caring human beings can sharing their innermost secrets well, almost all. It is one of those lazy days when queens can spend endless hours bitching about everybody in town and each other too. Just then in enters Samir - a handsome hunk whom Bibbo claims to be her driver. Only Bibbo doesn't have a car! Samir, an aspiring actor, is being towed around the film party circuit by Bibbo. The moment Shabbo sets her eyes on the hunk, she goes all out to charm and seduce him, right under Bibbo's hawk eyes! Such audacity! Surely Shabbo has to pay for it with tears. Bibbo has discovered Shabbo's dark secret and would not hesitate in using it as a vile weapon to hit back. Bibbo can be evil personified! Thrown into this crazy milieu is Shabbo's apprentice - a young pesky teenager Mandy, just about peeping out of his closet... a western closet - who says he is 'gay'! Mandy too has set his eyes on Samir and uses sly snaky ways to lure him - be it moving his butt seductively in front of Samir or taking a sneak peek at him in the shower. So who will finally win Samir - Bibbo, Shabbo, or Mandy? Does Samir have a say in all this? No! Because, as they say - Queens always have the last say'!The Pink Mirror IMDb page
