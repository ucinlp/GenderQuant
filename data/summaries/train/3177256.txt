It is prohibition, and beer barons Laurel and Hardy are sent to prison for concocting their own home brew. They are put in a cell with "Tiger" Long, the roughest, toughest and meanest of all inmates. Stan has a loose tooth that causes him to emit a razzberry at the end of every sentence; the inmate interprets this as a coolly defiant attitude and is impressed â€” nobody else ever stood up to him like that. He and Stan and Ollie become fast friends. After a prison break, the boys escape to a cotton plantation, where they hide out undetected, in blackface. When they attempt to repair the warden's car, they are discovered and are sent back to prison. They inadvertently break up a prison riot and the grateful warden issues them a pardon.  H.M. Walker wrote the opening title card to this film, which states, "Mr. Hardy is a man of wonderful ideas &mdash; So is Mr. Laurel &mdash; As long as he doesn't try to think."
