There once was a river where so many crocodiles roamed that it was far too dangerous for navigation or use. Many people from the surrounding villages had lost at least one of their relatives and loved ones to crocodile attacks. Among them, San, who changed his profession from being an ordinary farmer to a crocodile hunter, was no different. He wouldnâ€™t have lost his dearest wife, relatives, neighbours, best friend, and nearly his own life if the notorious crocodiles had not been around. Ever since, he was determined that as long as he was alive, he had to put those crocodiles to death.
