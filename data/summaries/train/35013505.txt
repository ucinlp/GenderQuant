In 1962, Ren√© Vautier, together with some Algerian friends, organized an audiovisual formation center to encourage a "dialogue in images" between the two factions. A film was edited from that experience, but the French police partially destroyed it. The images that were saved represent an unprecedented historical document: They tell of the Algerian War and the history of the ALN , as well as showing life after the war and, particularly, the reconstruction of the cities and the countryside after the war of Independence.
