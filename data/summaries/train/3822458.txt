Dr. Karl Kassel  comes to America to rally support for the Nazi cause among German-Americans. He instructs his audience at a German restaurant that the FÃ¼hrer has declared war on the evils of democracy and that as Germans, they should carry out his wishes. Kurt Schneider , an unemployed malcontent, joins the cause and eventually becomes a spy for the group. A letter written by Schneider to a liaison in Scotland is intercepted by a British Military Intelligence officer , leading to the ring's downfall. FBI agent Ed Renard  is assigned to the case, and is able to capture Schneider and extract a confession. Through Schneider, Renard is led to Hilda Kleinhauer , then Kassel's mistress Erika Wolff , and eventually the ringleader himself. While the FBI manages to capture many members of the ring and their accomplices, several, including Kassel, are secretly spirited back to Germany, but some ultimately face a worse fate there. The character and event portrayed by Ward Bond as an American Legionnaire is based on an actual event that occurred in late April 1938 when approximately 30 World War I American Legion Veterans stood up to the Bund in New York City during a celebration of Hitler's birthday. The veterans were severely beaten and later Cecil Schubert, who suffered a fractured skull, was personally recognized by Mayor La Guardia for his bravery. After the Duquesne Spy Ring was rounded up and convicted in 1941, this was no longer an idea that could be considered propaganda but a warning about what could and did happen in the US before and during the war. In 1946, Robinson appeared in a post-war anti-Nazi film, The Stranger.
