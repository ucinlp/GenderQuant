Andreas and Karin Vergerus  live in fine rapport, their personalities matching well. Both are quiet, contemplative, and very rational persons, not liable to act spontaneously. The intruder, "David Kovac", played by Elliott Gould, is in contrast an impetuous man, uncompromising, overbearing, and tormented by inner contradictions and compulsions. Karin and David become clandestine lovers, but aren't appropriate for each other. Before they meet David attempted suicide and Karin was unhappy to be reduced to a wife. They flower in their new love and it destroys their lives.
