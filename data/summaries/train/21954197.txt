The documentary takes Skreslet and fellow summiter Pat Morrow back to Base Camp, where they recall the traumatic and triumphant events of 1982. Pat Morrow has contracted a mystery illness that might prevent his return to the mountain. As part of the climbing party, Laurie Skreslet has brought his estranged nineteen-year-old daughter, Natasha. She has hardly seen her father in ten years. The Climb follows the events leading up to the 1982 Canadian climb of Everest. It examines the drama of the journey up the mountain as Skreslet and Morrow piece together using their emotional recollections of the events that happened twenty-five years ago, while on the trip back to Nepal and Everest's famous base camp. The film shows events as they unfolded on the mountain by using archival footage shot in 1982 while being narrated by Skreslet and Morrow.
