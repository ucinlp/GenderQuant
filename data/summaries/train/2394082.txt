Pat Kramer is an ordinary suburban housewife and mother whose husband works for an advertising company. After being exposed to an experimental perfume, she begins to shrink, gradually at first, then rapidly. A few weeks pass, and Pat has shrunk to the height of her own children. Eventually, she becomes a celebrity of sorts, appearing on The Mike Douglas Show, and captures the hearts of the American people. Soon she is less than a foot tall, making her like a doll to her children, and forcing her to move into a dollhouse. Pat is kidnapped by a group of mad scientists, who make it seem that she perished in the kitchen garbage disposal. They plan to shrink everyone in the world by performing experiments on her to learn her secret. With the help of a kind young lab custodian and a super-intelligent gorilla named Sydney, she escapes. She shrinks to microscopic size and falls into a puddle of spilled household chemicals - which makes her return to her original size. After her homecoming celebrating her returning to a more normal size, she notices that her foot has split her shoe open.
