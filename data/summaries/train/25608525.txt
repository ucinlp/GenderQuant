Unlike other Alamo films that concentrate on Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie, the main protagonists are Almaron  and Susanna Dickinson  and their daughter Angelina . The film gives a fictionalised fast moving account of the restriction on American emigration to Texas, the arrest of Stephen F. Austin by Santa Anna , Sam Houston  appointed General to build the army of Texas, and Dickinson's participation in both the Battle of Gonzales and the Battle of the Alamo.
