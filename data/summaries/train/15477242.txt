Adam is a college senior, and an aspiring singer/songwriter. He meets Eve - a beautiful, bright, talented  college girl. They begin dating; and he quickly learns that, hard as it is to believe of such a hot girl in today's campus world, Eve is still a virgin. For her it is not about religion, or waiting for wedlock, but about waiting until it feels "right." This begins a relationship that is at once sexy, romantic, sometimes painful, and often hilarious, as Adam, Eve and all their friends wait for Eve to be ready.
