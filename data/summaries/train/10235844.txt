Mr. Thapar will only let Anjali go there after she marries the man of his choice; so Anjali decides to run away. Her father alerts a ruthless CBI Officer Sikander Baksh , who is soon on her case. Anjali meets with car-thieves, Karan and his uncle , and then begins her journey into a past life, as Nandini, the lover of freedom fighter Abhay , and his subsequent death at the hands of British-aided traitor Tejeshwar Singhal . Anjali does not know that Tejeshwar is still alive, is a powerful minister in the Indian Government, and has decided that he will make history repeat itself by separating the two lovers again - this time with the help of the government machinery.
