Ernie Mott  is a restless, irresponsible, wandering cockney with a good musical ear. His father died in World War I. Ernie wants a better life but doesn't want to settle down or work for it. This extends to his love life; musician Aggie Hunter  genuinely cares for him, but he prefers the company of fickle gangster's ex-wife Ada Brantline .http://www.allmovie.com/work/none-but-the-lonely-heart-35601 When Ernie finds out that his mother has cancer, he decides to stay put, be a good son, and help her run her shop. A series of unfortunate incidents leads to his mother dying in prison, and he fails to win the lasting affection of Ada. At the end of the film there is a mention of the on-going war  and some indication that Ernie may be going to straighten out his life and perhaps think seriously about settling down with Aggie.
