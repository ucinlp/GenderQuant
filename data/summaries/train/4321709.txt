Hunting guide Mike Davis comes across a cache of diamonds in a remote region of South Africa, but refuses to reveal its location even under torture at the hand of the diamond company's security chief, Vogel. The company's owner, Martingale, tries a different tactic by hiring a beautiful woman, Suzanne Renaud, to seduce Davis and find out where the diamonds can be found.
