The film tells of novice dancer Irene Foote  who convinces vaudeville comic Vernon Castle  to give up slapstick comedy in favor of sophisticated ballroom dancing. Their big break comes when they are stranded in Paris, along with their friend Walter Ashe , with no money. They catch the eye of influential agent Maggie Sutton , who arranges a tryout for them at the prestigious Caf√© de Paris, where they become an overnight sensation. After taking Europe by storm, the Castles return to the United States and become just as big a sensation. Their fame and fortune rises to unprecedented heights in the immediate pre&ndash;World War I years. When Vernon volunteers to join the air force, Irene makes patriotic movie serials to aid the war effort. However, Vernon is killed in a training accident, leaving Irene to carry on alone.
