Sandy Ricks  is a young boy living in the Florida Keys who befriends a dolphin injured by a harpoon. His father, fisherman Porter Ricks  is upset, as dolphins compete for fish, which jeopardizes the family income and is upset Sandy neglects his chores. After "Flipper"  recovers from the wound, the dolphin puts on a show to entertain the neighborhood children. Later, however, the animal devours Porter's entire catch of pompano. Porter harshly berates Sandy for allowing Flipper to jump into the holding pen of valuable fish waiting to go to market, "What's wrong with you boy? How old are you, 12,&nbsp;— almost in your teens, or are you five,&nbsp;— a child who doesn't have the sense to know what his next meal depends on?" Reduced to tears, Sandy retreats to his bedroom as Porter's wife Martha  remonstrates that "he's only a boy". Determined to make up for the loss, Sandy sets off to find more fish, and is led by Flipper to a large school of fish near a reef. Later, Sandy is rescued from a threatening shark by Flipper, and the grateful father draws closer to his son. Porter Ricks is finally convinced there are enough fish for both the local residents of the area and the dolphins.
