Republican newspaper magnate Kay Thorndyke  intends to make her lover, aircraft tycoon Grant Matthews , President of the United States with her as the power behind the throne. Thorndyke plans to use her newspaper chain's influence to deadlock the 1948 Republican National Convention, so it will choose Matthews as a compromise dark horse candidate instead of Dewey, Taft, or another. Matthews is skeptical of the idea of running for president, but Thorndyke, Republican strategist Jim Conover , and campaign manager Spike McManus  persuade him to run. Matthews reunites with estranged wife Mary  for the campaign. Despite knowing about Thorndyke and her husband's affair, Mary agrees to support him in public because of his idealism and honesty and she does not know about Thorndyke's role in the campaign. The politically na√Øve Matthews makes a controversial speech in Wichita denouncing big labor. Before he makes another controversial speech in Detroit denouncing big business, Thorndyke secretly persuades him to moderate his tone to help his chances for the nomination. With her and Conover's help, Matthews makes deals with various special interests for their support. Before a nationwide fireside chat from the Matthews' home, Mary learns of Thorndyke's continuing relationship with her husband and sees the deals that he has made. Matthews realizes that he has betrayed his and Mary's ideals. On live radio, he denounces both his backers and himself as frauds, withdraws as a candidate while promising to seek bipartisan reform, and asks for his wife's forgiveness. When his backers attempt to turn off the speech, he angrily calls out, "Don't cut me off, I paid for this broadcast!". That line was used similarly by Ronald Reagan at a 1980 New Hampshire debate.
