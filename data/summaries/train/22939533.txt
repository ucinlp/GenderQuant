At the age of 40, porn star Colton Ford decides to leave the industry and pursue his true calling â€” a singing career. He feels he has the voice, but his "overexposed" past could be the hook that gets him noticed or the hook that yanks him off stage. Naked Fame follows Colton and his former life-partner, porn star Blake Harper, as they try to ease their way back into the mainstream. The film examines the inner-workings of music industry and documents the emotional struggles involved in the pursuit of one's dreams. It contains footage and interviews from Chi Chi LaRue, Bruce Vilanch, Pepper Mashay and Lonnie Gordon, and Ford's parents.
