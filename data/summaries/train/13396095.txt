Borrowing elements from the Warner Brothers cartoon Porky in Wackyland, it begins with an antisocial alley cat complaining about his life in the city , mentioning how he doesn't get along with children  and babies , dogs , and other people. Much of his opening commentary is done as he is walking or lying on a busy sidewalk, with people walking on him and providing an occasional kick, one of which sends him to the front of the Moonbeam Rocket Company  as he declares that he wants to go to the moon. In the showroom of Moonbeam Rocket Company are rockets to Mars, Venus, Palm Springs , and a "Moon Special," which the cat enters. He pushes the start button , and the flight begins as buildings duck out of the way, "no vacancy" signs appear on planets as he passes them, and a succession of space-related sight gags ensue. Stars move out of the way of the rocket, which subsequently punches a hole in the Big Dipper before the Little Dipper moves to catch the leakage; the rocket then bounces pinball-style from star to star  until it registers "Tilt" upon lunar impact. After the crash, the cat revels in his newfound solitude, but the silence was only momentary as he discovers his new neighbors: *A bicycle horn tooting itself *A steam whistle blowing *Disembodied mouth and hands repeatedly saying "Mammy, Mammy, Mammy" in the style of Al Jolson *A self-playing accordion *A yo-yo going up and down with the sound of a slide whistle *A manual fire engine siren operating itself *A tire repeatedly having blowouts by running over nails *A claw hammer chasing a nail, then pounding the cat into the group before pulling him out *A tube of lipstick chasing a pair of giggling lips  *A hand and scissors chasing a piece of paper  *An invisible dog chasing a fire hydrant *A diaper, a safety pin, and a bottle of baby powder  *A daisy-like flower running away from a shovel  *A pencil chased by a pencil sharpener, which subsequently sharpens the cat's tail  The cat realizes that his original home was much preferable to his new surroundings; he pulls down a golf course backdrop, places himself on a tee and sends himself back to Earth with one swing of the golf club. He returns to "The good ol' U.S. of A." (on the corner of 45th Street and [[Broadway  and expresses his newfound appreciation of his home and the people who continue to walk over him.
