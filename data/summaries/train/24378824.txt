The Cosmonaut starts in 1967 when Stas and Andrei  arrive to the newly built Star City, where the first cosmonauts trained to go into space, and where a race against the clock to beat the Americans into space takes place. Stas and Andrei will witness first-hand the political plots, the fights for power and the successes and failures of the Soviet Union in some of the greatest achievements of the 20th century. They will meet Yulia, a communications technician, with whom they will strike up a strong friendship, always close to love but never consummated. The Cosmonaut is the story of three characters surrounded by events that happened over a fifteen-year period: successes and failures, accidents, conspiracies, favoritism and secret missions. The team of Riot Cinema, one of the youngest ones in Spanish cinema, has spent a year preparing the portrayal of a period that has never been told before, full of unique locations, with meticulous photography, art direction and acting.  The main influences behind The Cosmonauts conception and filmmaking approach are the works of some of the world's most renowned filmmakers. The project’s dossierhttp://s268192870.mialojamiento.es/The_Cosmonaut.pdf| Project Dossier mentions specifically the names of Wong Kar-wai , Andrei Tarkovsky, José Luis Guerín, and Robert Bresson, among others. There are many links especially to Andrei Tarkovsky’s body of work either thematically , or plot-related . These ties are more evident through a look in the collaborators’ list: among others, the names of Eduard Artemyev, and Marina Tarkovskaya . The fictional Program K, whose hummingbird icon is one of the main images used in the project’s promotion, and which also gives its name to the virtual community of producers of the film, is based on the real Soviet projects that attempted to place a Soviet cosmonaut on the Moon.
