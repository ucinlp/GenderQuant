The story goes that the Pink Panther decides to purchase a large plant for his home in the city. While visiting the flower shop and this man uses Speedy Grow to grow his plant but then all of a sudden his 10&nbsp;inch tail slips and comes into contact with a spilled bottle of Speedy Grow. This results in his 10&nbsp;inch pink tail to grow to 19 and 1/2&nbsp;inches the equivalent length of a 20 foot fire hose. The panther then walks through town, with his enlongated fire hose tail wrapped over his arm to prevent it from being entangled in any such obstacle.
