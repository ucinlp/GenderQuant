Maria is trying to raise enough money to move a group of German orphans to South America, where they can start life anew. Joe wants to help her, and with his buddies British Corps of Military Police Sergeant Roger Morris  and ex-RAF pilot Brian Hammell , Joe plans a daring robbery. A fortune in recently discovered gold bullion is being transferred to England from Germany via military transport, and the trio intend to hijack the plane. While the robbery goes off almost as planned, the three participants begin to have second thoughts about what to do with their ill-gotten gains.
