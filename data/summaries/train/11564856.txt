In Paris, a girl by the name of Maureen Winston  is abducted by two evil-looking men. While her family prays for her safe return, Maureen's father heaps guilt on her sister Margaret , since she convinced her to go see the world. However, Margaret's grandfather ([[Leon Ames  has an idea: call for Jake Speed  to go and rescue her. However, there is one problem: Jake Speed is a character in a series of 40's-style pulp fiction novels. However, Jake Speed does exist, as Margaret finds out when he leaves a note for her to meet him and his sidekick, Desmond Floyd , in a tough Paris bar. The novels, as Margaret finds out, are based on Jake and Des's real life adventures, and they work for nothing, seeing action and excitement  as their reward. Jake reveals that Maureen was kidnapped by white slavers, and is being held in an African country. Jake, Des, and Margaret fly to the nation, which is in the middle of a civil war, in order to rescue her. Many twists and turns later, we find out that Jake's archenemy, the evil, perverted, murderous Englishman Sid , is behind the ring, and soon, Margaret becomes a part of it. Jake and Des must now rescue both Maureen and Margaret, stop Sid, and help the girls get out in one piece, while dealing with warring factions, pits of lions, and machine gun-firing helicopters.
