Kelly Holden  hears an interview with novelist Graydon Jennings ([[Chris Potter  about his latest work Thrill of the Kill. Based on some similarities between the novel’s victim and Kelly’s murdered sister Alison, Kelly approaches Graydon at a book signing in Burlington, Vermont and asks for his help solving her sisters murder. Hank ([[Paul Hopkins  is a former suspect, who has transferred his affections from Alison to Kelly. He lets Kelly know that she should be careful of Graydon, but also follows her in a stalker like fashion. Looking for clues in Alison’s diary, Kelly and Graydon deduce that she was having an affair with a U.S. Senator, and since one of Vermont’s senators is a “63-year-old woman”, they set their investigation on Senator Darren Hartford ([[Matt Cooke . It becomes clear that the senator would do almost anything to keep his affair with Alison secret, but the investigation takes on a different twist towards the end.
