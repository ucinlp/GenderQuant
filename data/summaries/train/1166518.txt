A group of tourists are stranded in the Namibian desert when their bus loses its way and runs out of fuel. Canned food and dew keep the tourists alive, but they are helplessly entrapped, completely cut off from the rest of the world. As courage and moral fibre weaken and relationships grow shaky, Henry, a theatrical manager, persuades the group to put on Shakespeare's tragedy King Lear. As the tourists work their way through Henry's hand-written scripts, real life increasingly begins to resemble the play.
