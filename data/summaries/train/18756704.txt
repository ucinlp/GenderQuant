Marie Stubbs is a diminutive Glaswegian headmistress who is close to the age of retirement. After being Head teacher at The Douay Martyrs School, Ickenham, she takes on one last challenge: to improve the fortunes of St George's School in North West London. The school is facing closure after its previous headmaster, Philip Lawrence, was murdered in 1995, while breaking up a fight between his pupils and students from a rival school.
