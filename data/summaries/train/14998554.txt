Hank Martin , an American mechanic, is knocked out and wakes up in the land of King Arthur. Here he finds romance with Alisande la Carteloise  and friendship with Sir Sagramore . Unfortunately, the heroic Hank also incurs the hatred of both Merlin  and Morgan le Fay . While Hank persuades King Arthur , an aged, semi-perpetual, cold-in-the-nose invalid, to tour his kingdom in disguise to see the true, wretched condition of his subjects, Merlin and Morgan plot to usurp his throne. When Hank tries to stop them, he is returned to his own time. Heartsick over losing the woman he loves, he goes on a tour of a British castle. Its owner, Lord Pendragon , sends him to see his niece, who looks just like Alisande. A highlight of the film is the scene in which Hank Martin teaches the court musicians how to "jazz up" the medieval music they are playing. However, the best-known song from the score is "Busy Doing Nothing" by Jimmy Van Heusen and Johnny Burke, which Hank, Sir Sagramore and the King sing when they are strolling through the woods pretending to be peasants.
