In 1993, in Kampong Chhnang Province, a couple built a new wooden house along Nation Road #5. They intended to live there and eventually sell the house. One night, they dreamed that an old man bought their house with $3000 in gold. They woke up and found the gold. But they didn't leave the house until one morning, they found themselves sleeping in the field beside the house, to their shock and horror. They quickly left and went to live with relatives, but the terrors never finished. Some bad things begin to happen one by one to people who didn't believe the story, like the visitor who lived at this house and ended up in a car accident. The villagers' fear spread and they sought out a ghostbuster to face the ghosts. After the ghosts spoke to the ghostbuster, they agreed to stop haunting people if the people would stop coming to the house. Finally the village became quiet and happy again and the abandoned house became part of the local mythology to present day.
