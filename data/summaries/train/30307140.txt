The film tells the story of fraternal twins Giri  and Gowri , who lost their parents in an accident early in life. They grew up together in an orphanage, inseparable. And when they grew rich, they set up an accident rescue unit in Pondicherry in memories of their parents. They have even learnt mountaineering to carry out rescue operations. Their team consists of characters played by Saiju Kurup, Anoop Chandran and Bijukkuttan, and good for nothing ambulance-chasing lawyer named Lawrence . Giri and Gowri are absolutely inseparable, and for the same reason have remained unmarried as well. One day they rescues a girl named Saira Banu  from an accident, but then on, with Saira's identity remaining a mystery. Saira remains behind a purdah for a long time, and the antics that the men around her come up with to take a look at her face forms the comedy element of the film. Giri finds that Saira's accident was fabricated by Gowri's fiance Mishal. Everything around their happy life takes a sudden change from that point.
