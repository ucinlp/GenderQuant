El Brendel plays the dual role of Silent McGee, a tough gangster, and Mr. Oscar Lemon, a mild-mannered Swede who coincidentally looks exactly like the gangster McGee. Silent McGee disguises himself as a Swedish immigrant while running from the law, causing Mr. Lemon to be mistaken for the wanted man. Fifi D'Orsay stars as Julie LaRue, a comedic vamp who pursues the comparatively innocent Mr. Lemon. Comedian Eddie Cantor wrote some of the dialogue for this film. Fox Film Corporation advertised Mr. Lemon of Orange as Brendel's first starring role, although the film Just Imagine , which was released nearly six months earlier, made the same claim. This film is notable as one of the few examples of El Brendel playing a character -- in this instance, Silent McGee -- who does not speak in Brendel's trademark Swedish accent. Silent McGee, when not in disguise, speaks in unaccented American English.
