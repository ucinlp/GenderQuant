Bank teller Henry Dimsdale finds ten $1,000 bills. He is a widower with seven kids and could use the money, and housekeeper Golda tells him it's a case of finder's keepers. Henry waits two weeks to see if anyone claims the missing money. No one does, so he splurges on a new car and a diamond ring for Ellie Barton, his fiancee. But when the bank discovers a $50,000 shortage, Henry becomes a prime suspect. He, his family and Ellie take it on the lam to Arizona. A detective, Jasper Lynch, the boyfriend of Golda, is assigned to investigate. Henry's boss at the bank, Pomeroy, is seen with a sexy younger woman, Monica, who has expensive tastes. After a chase, Henry is placed under arrest. His kids hide a tape recorder in Pomeroy's pocket, though, and get an admission of guilt. That frees their dad to marry Ellie while the helpful Golda and Jasper do likewise.
