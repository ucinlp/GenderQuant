Swedish military intelligence officers Carl Hamilton  and Åke Stålhandske  are ordered to eliminate a band of Russian smugglers on the Russian tundra. The smugglers possess a nuclear missile, a 1.5 megaton SS-20, "enough to turn Paris, Washington or New York to ashes". What they do not know is that the smugglers they have intercepted were only a decoy, while the real missile was shipped to Libya. Mark Hamill plays Mike Hawkins, the film's antagonist, an American former CIA officer working in Murmansk.
