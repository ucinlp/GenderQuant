A British coastal command pilot sinks what he believes to be a German submarine, which in fact turns out to be British. He is charged with neglect, and volunteers for a deadly mission. His girlfriend meanwhile tries to prove that he is innocent, and did sink a German U-boat rather than a British one.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041576/plotsummary
