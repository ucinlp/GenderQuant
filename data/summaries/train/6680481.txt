An old woman sends a girl begging in the streets of Paris on a snowy evening. Callous revelers pass her by, and she falls asleep before one donor finally drops a golden Louis in her shoe. A gambler with a sure tip on roulette but no cash borrows the coin to win a fortune for the girl. She wakes, and the two miss each other wandering the streets until the gambler finds the girl dead.
