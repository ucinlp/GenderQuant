Donald Duck is a lumberjack who sets out to top a tall tree atop a hill. The tree turns out to be the home of chipmunks Chip and Dale, who repeatedly foil Donald's attempts. After the tree is topped, Donald realizes the chipmunks have been sabotaging his efforts, and in retaliation, he chops the entire tree down with an ax. The tree falls and flips end over end landing on a log flume. Using a pike pole, Donald catches a ride on the log and heads for the sawmill. Chip and Dale hurriedly catch a ride in a toolbox on a zip line overhead. They ride ahead of Donald, jump from the tool box with a hammer, and dismantle a side of the flume with it. The log then flies out of control down the hill. Donald finds himself running for his life just ahead of it as it continues down the hill after him. The situation gets progressively worse as the log falls onto Donald's car and rolls through a mine reappearing with dynamite. Finally the log heads for Donald's cabin. Donald frantically moves everything out of log's way as it flies through the house not damaging anything. Donald breathes a sigh of relief thinking the disaster has been avoided. But just then Dale knocks on the door and shows him that the log has struck power lines and is about to spring back onto the house. Donald makes a futile effort to physically move the house, but the log collides with the house and destroys it in successive dynamite explosions. Chip and Dale pretend to comfort Donald who is dazed with grief  before rolling on the ground laughing.
