A young writer, Lily  goes on an emotional rollercoaster with the much older  and sophisticated Michael . They navigate through a web of exploration on marriage, cheating, babies, and entrapment. In the kitchen above, the very pregnant Shelly  is terrified that becoming a mother will drive away her husband and has turned for advice to her lesbian friend Jude , sure that this magnificent cook who has been in a long-term relationship has it all figured out. It is revealed that Shelly has her own secrets that fuel her fear and Jude's relationship may not be exactly as it appears. They struggle through—fighting, laughing, crying, cooking & eating—trying to work out what really makes relationships work.
