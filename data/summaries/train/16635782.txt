Two thugs from the Perth suburb of Midland catch the last train to Fremantle. When a young woman, unaware that the train guards are on strike, boards the train several stops later, the thugs are interested by her. After two others - an older woman and a silent man - board the train, it becomes apparent that not everybody on the train is who they appear to be.
