Rajni is supposed to marry Sheeba, an alliance not approved of by her father. He is killed and goes to Heaven only to learn that his death was a mistake. He is offered another body to inhabit, that of a timid villager whose uncle and aunt are plotting to kill him. He takes up the offer and teaches them a lesson while romancing with Kanaga. But coming into contact with some characters from his earlier life, reminds him of his duties over there too. He solves all problems and all's well that end well. A clip from this film entitled "Little Superstar", featuring a little person dancing to the Holiday Rap by MC Miker G and DJ Sven, has gained popularity on the Internet.
