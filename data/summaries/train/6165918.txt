J. Effingham Bellwether  is a guest in a hotel, where he meets the House Detective's Wife  who likes to flirt with other men. After brief encounters with a little girl  and the House Detective , Bellwether offers to teach the Detective's Wife how to play golf. The two of them and their Caddy  go out to the golf course, but Bellwether never gets to hit the ball; his lessons are being constantly interrupted by such distractions as the Caddy's squeaking shoes, pieces of paper being blown by the wind into his path, accidentally stepping into a pie that the Caddy had brought, et cetera. At the end, the police and the House Detective come out to the course to arrest con artist Bellwether for a list of absurd crimes ; the police put handcuffs on him just as he's showing the Detective's Wife the importance of keeping the wrists close together while gripping the club.
