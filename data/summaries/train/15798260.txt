A mysterious artist, Ronnie Mason, steals a dead woman's wedding ring and money and leaves a fake suicide note. Her husband, Thomas Turner, believed his wife might have been seeing Mason behind his back. Mason leaves town, changes his name to Marsh and rents a room in the house of Hilda Fenchurch and her younger sister Anne. To the consternation of professor Andrew Lang, who loves Hilda, she falls for Marsh, the new tenant. The scheming Marsh learns that it is Anne who might inherit a great deal of money, so he suddenly switches his affections toward her. Hilda is jealous and suspicious. She plots to lure Marsh to a beach house and poison him. She isn't able to go through with it, but when Marsh runs off, he is surprised by Thomas Turner and plunges off a steep cliff to his death.
