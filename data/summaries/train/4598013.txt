Set in Germany sometime in the late 18th century where Mytyl , the bratty daughter of a woodcutter ([[Russell Hicks , finds a unique bird in the Royal Forest and selfishly refuses to give it to her sick friend. Mytyl and Tyltyl's parents are separated when the woodcutter must go off to fight in an unspecified war, but mother and father are mortified at her behavior. That night, she is visited in a dream by a fairy named Berylune  who sends her and her brother Tyltyl  to search for the Blue Bird of Happiness. To accompany them, the fairy magically transforms their dog Tylo , cat Tylette , and lantern  into human form. The children have a number of adventures. The dream journey makes Mytyl awake as a kinder and gentler girl who has learned to appreciate all the comforts and joys of her home and family, and the children's father returns home safely from the war. The film, although following the basic plot of the stage version, highly embellishes it, and does not literally use the original dialogue. The opening black-and-white scenes and the war subplot were invented for the film. Mytyl's selfishness, the basic trait of her personality, was a plot thread specifically written into the motion picture. It is not in the original play. The play begins with the children already asleep and the dream about to begin. There is absolutely no depiction of the family's daily life, as there is in the 1940 film.
