Surya  is an angry young man who is a post-graduate looking for a job. His girlfriend is Sruthi  who always tries to control his rage as he fights against injustice in society. He fights for a friend  who is a gold medalist but does not get a job as he is not able to get a loan from a bank as he does not have any collateral to pledge. Another gold medalist friend dies in an accident after running helter-skelter hunting for a job. All this changes Suryaâ€™s life especially after he meets a well-known writer and intellectual, Udaya Murthy  who urges him along with others to start a movement against corruption and injustice in society. They start an Unemployed Graduate Association which rubs the local politician and don Muthukaruppan  the wrong way. The idealist Surya turns into a raging force after Murthy is shot dead by police and he is jailed. In jail, he is brutally tortured by the police as he becomes a rallying point for the youth who are fighting unemployment.
