A boy named George is magically transformed into a pig. In a dangerous and crazy adventure, the boy, his sister, Kathy, his best friend Freud, and their college housekeeper, Matilda leave for Mexico to try to undo the witchcraft before their parents return from their Paris trip. While gathering ingredients in order for Matilda's grandmother, Berta, to undo the spell, Kathy grows impatient and after insulting both Matilda and Berta, storms off into town, where she befriends two Mexican girls who speak English and have satellite TV. Meanwhile, Freud accidentally loses George to a butcher. With Kathy and her friends, they try to rescue George, in the process of angering the butcher. They are able to get George to Coyote Mountain, under a full moon phase, where a potion has been prepared to return George to normal. Unfortunately, the butcher had followed them, just as the ritual had begun. Matilda and Berta dose the butcher with the potion, turning him into a vulture, while George is restored to normal. They soon return home and act like nothing's happened, except for the fact that George still has a pig's tail.
