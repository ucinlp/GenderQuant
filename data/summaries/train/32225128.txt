President Kongi , the dictator of an African developing nation, is trying to modernize his nation after deposing King Oba Danlola . The different tribes are resisting unification, so he tries to reach his goal by any means necessary, including forcing government officials to wear traditional African outfits and seeking advice from the man he deposed. He demands tribute from Danlola in the form of a yam, an important food in the culture. Danlola's former lover Segi brings the dictator the head of her father as sacrifice.
