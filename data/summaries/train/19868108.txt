The elderly Turnbull sisters want to donate their mansion for a children's hospital. However, their father's will states that at least one of them has to stay in the house every night for twenty years before they can inherit the estate; there are two weeks left to go. Then some strange things start occurring. A stranger forces his way past Nancy Drew  and brazenly searches the Drew house for related affidavits her lawyer father Carson  has obtained. Then, the Turnbulls' chauffeur Phillips  dies, though it is uncertain if it was a murder or a suicide. The frightened old ladies consider leaving their home. When Nancy recognizes the dead man as the trespasser, she begins investigating, dragging her boyfriend Ned Nickerson  into one predicament after another, eventually getting him fired and jailed. When police Captain Tweedy  arrests the two sisters for Phillips' murder, their ownership is endangered. Just in time, Nancy and Ned discover a secret passageway in the basement linking it to the neighboring house, owned by Daniel Talbert . Talbert would make a lot of money if a racetrack were to be built on the two properties, but the Turnbulls had turned down an offer to buy their place.
