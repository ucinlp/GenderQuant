Charlotte and John Weiland, along with Charlotte's sister Jennie, find themselves destitute after a fire claims all of their belongings, their money, and their only child, Sarah. A solicitor rents them a large, remote house in the countryside where they attempt to recover from the aftermath of the fire, and the death of their little girl. Charlotte soon believes her daughter is in the house, and alienates herself from her husband and sister by retreating to the strange yellow wallpapered attic. The plot for the movie is unlike the actual short story making the movie adaption more of a reimagining.
