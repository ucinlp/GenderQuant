Set in rural Spain, Bardot plays Ursula, a young girl who has just left a convent and has moved in with her aunt Florentine and her violent husband, the count Ribera. Ribera wants to see Lambert, a young man from the village, dead. Ursula quickly falls in love with Lambert. In a confrontation between the two, Lambert kills Ribera in self-defence. The reason for the conflict soon becomes clear to Ursula: he was having an affair with her aunt. However, when Florentine discovers her lover has no intention of making any commitment to her, she refuses to confirm Lambert's alibi to the police and forces him into becoming a fugitive. Ursula, always impulsive, runs off with him and together they seek a way to get him safely out of the country.
