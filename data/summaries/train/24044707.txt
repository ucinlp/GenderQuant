Fernando is a failed football goalkeeper who is finding it even hard to find his bread and butter. During the final local league soccer game of the season, goalkeeper Roman  is injured and useless Fernando  steps in to face a last-minute penalty kick. But before it's converted, the unruly crowd spills onto the field preventing play from continuing, and the referee decrees the penalty must be retaken one week later. With money in the balance and a chance for the team to advance to a more prestigious league, the hitherto unpopular Fernando suddenly finds himself getting kid glove treatment, with team coach Santos  even arranging a date with Roman's reluctant girlfriend Cecilia , whom Fernando fancies.
