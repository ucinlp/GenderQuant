The film is a biographical true story about life of Imadaddin Nasimi, well-known throughout the East for his school of philosophy and thought, poems and promotion of moral values in a feudal society. During the 14th-15th centuries, when Azerbaijan was a stage for warring powers and civil wars, Nasimi was the only poet committed to promotion of humanism and moral values inflicting criticism on the ruling system and the society itself. For his intruding role in feudal regimes, Nasimi lived a complex and tragic life. At the end of the film, Nasimi is killed in front of masses as his skin is pealed off while alive.
