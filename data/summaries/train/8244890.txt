A genetics laboratory run by Dr. Irwin Burns  to research aggressive behavior has an accident, resulting in a chemical fire and explosion, and the escape of a thirty foot long hybrid snake with traits of both the Asian King Cobra  and the Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake. Loose in the countryside and filled with the experimental aggressiveness drug, the snake, nicknamed "Seth", eventually outgrows his woodland prey, it begins hunting the residents of the small brewery town of Filmore. Doc Kragen  conducts an autopsy on a recently found body and determines that the death was caused by a huge snake. He and Police Chief Jo Biddle  go to the Mayor  and demand he cancel an upcoming town lager festival. The Mayor refuses, but after more deaths, the town eventually brings in snake expert and hunter Nick Hashimoto .
