Betty Boop is putting her nephew, Junior, to bed, but he isn't ready to sleep. He jumps on the bed then uses a tube of toothpaste to put stripes on the cat. When Betty catches him, she tells him a fairy tale about a naughty boy. The boy in the story ties a can on a puppy's tail, scares a hen and prematurely frees her chick, shakes apples off a tree and cuts it down, throws bricks at a greenhouse, knocks clean laundry into the mud, and shaves the head of the barber. When he teases a lion at a nearby circus, the lion escapes its cage and the boy has to be rescued by a magic fairy . The fairy rescues the little boy but makes him promise to undo all his mischief. This is done rather easily by the animators reversing the sequence of scenes from the first part of the story. Junior isn't sure that he believes the story, but at last he is ready to go to sleep.
