An office worker named Richard decides to invite his co-worker Janet to go on a camping trip with him to a secluded forest, and she accepts his offer. As soon as they arrive at the forest, Richard begins to show off his woodman's prowess by catching a fish and killing a rabbit. Janet isn't particularly impressed, but still she lets him rip her clothes off and throw her into the lake, where they frolic for a while before coming ashore to make love, during which Richard inexplicably smears blood all over her. As they continue their journey, they talk about their lives, the beauty and cruelty of nature, and make allusions to classical literature. Janet and Richard arrive at the cabin, that Richard knew about, they enjoy a picnic, while Janet had some insights about her life and begins to weep. Almost an hour of talking, two strange and suspicious men, Jarvis and the Troubadour, show up at the cabin to sing hippy folk songs to the travelers. The two men begin to torture Janet and Richard, they rape Janet and put her in an ice box and imprison Richard in a chicken coop to watch them finish the job. What is strange by the ending is that Richard wakes in the morning, still caged in the chicken coop, to see Janet saying goodbye to the men as they leave.{{cite web}}
