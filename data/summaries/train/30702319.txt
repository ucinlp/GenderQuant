The film opens, showing us the life of Dijo John , a nature & wildlife photographer, his wife and young son. In a flashback scene, we see dijo eloping with Brahmin girl Sathyavathy . He keeps taking trips to the forests and clicking pictures for magazines like National geographic and also on his website which he uses to sell him images online. On one such trips to the forests, he happens to save an Aadivasi boy, Thammi, from the hands of a notorious police officer and his crew and becomes the spokesperson on their behalf. He even makes a photograph of the police officer aiming at the harmless boy and tries to bring the issue to public. But his friend who is also the state forest minister assures protection to the boy and advises him from making these incidents more public.Thammi who is lodged in a juvenile home, happens to be there for a while but toward the middle of the film goes missing. Then our wild life activist is again on the run towards the interiors of the forest to trace the child. And amidst the new mission, the photographer is also missing. And then comes the surprise package of the film which turns out to be another non starter. Dijo's younger brother Joy  is a happy-go-lucky rich planter and a pulp writer who has a publication. He who tries to break comedies and try to be in par with the Lal of late eighties, try to investigate the situation but with little success. Later Dijo is found walking around the forest in a dazed condition as he realizes that his fight for the rights of adivasi is a futile exercise and all including his friend, the forest minister and the bureaucracy is nowhere to help the men of the forest.
