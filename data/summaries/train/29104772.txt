Ruth Ashley  and her partner, scheming, Gregory Stone, , operate the Hollywood Escort Bureau, as well as the bars, where the escorts take their clients, to see the strip show, and buy expensive champagne. Ruth was a former escort girl herself, but has worked her way up. Ruth's earnings have given her a big house, and sent her beautiful daughter, June , to the best finishing schools. June is not aware her Mother is in the dubious escort business; she's been very carefully kept in the dark. When June unexpectedly, comes home and announces her engagement to Drake Hamilton , a special investigator, for the district attorney. It looks like the gig is up. Ruth is ready to give up the business; but, sleazy Gregory wants the gravy train to keep rolling. When Drake calls for an escort girl, under an assumed name, as part of his investigation, Gregory schemes to have naive June sent up. Drake assumes the worst, when she arrives; and, their engagement is off. It doesn't take long for Gregory to get distraught, June drunk, in his apartment. When Ruth finds her there, like a lioness, protecting her young, she pulls a gun. Desperate to get to the bottom of things, Drake brawls his way through the investigation, and rushes to Gregory's apartment; but, will it be too late, as they all wrestle for the gun?
