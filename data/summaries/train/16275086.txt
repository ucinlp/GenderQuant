The story begins with a new English teacher Rahul Udyavar  joining Saraswati Vidya Mandir school, in the Mirpurkhas suburbs. He strikes instant rapport with students and teachers alike. When Rahul Udyavar unifies the teachers  against the atrocities of the school's management, Principal Aditya Sahay  defends the management's decision. This comes as a shocker to the teachers as Sahay is known for his dedication as an educator for the last 32 years who has built the school's high reputation. The situation becomes graver as school management becomes overambitious with its growth and involves media planners in the extracurricular activities. This demands the involvement of students in TV reality shows and other media PR activities used for building the school's image in public which starts reflecting on the students' stress levels. The pressure on young minds increases incredibly, leading to unexpected and grim consequences. Caught in the web of commercialization, the students go on strike unable to take the pressure, and it becomes a national issue.
