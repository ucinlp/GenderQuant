The lives of 10-year-old Gülistan and her brother, Fırat, are turned upside down one quiet and dark night on the Diyarbakır-Batman highway while they’re on their way home with their parents from a wedding in a nearby village. Their father, a journalist working with a local newspaper, and their mother, who gave birth just six months ago to their baby sister, Dilovan, are murdered by paramilitary forces. The kids are taken care of by their aunt, the sister of their late mother. However, a few weeks on, their aunt goes missing, too. Left alone to look after their baby sister at such a young age, when they are not even capable of taking care of themselves, the kids are left penniless, and a few weeks later, they are forced to live on the streets of Diyarbakır, where they will have to fight really hard to survive.
