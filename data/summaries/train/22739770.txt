The film tells the dramatized true story of Philippe Berre, an actual Frenchman with a reputation as an impostor. In the film, much as actual events, Monsieur Berre goes to a small town, passing himself off as a civil engineer, and claims that the government has decided to start previously scrapped plans for the construction of a highway. He commissions supplies, gains construction vehicles, and brings jobs to the community and actually constructs a section of roadway in the process before being discovered.
