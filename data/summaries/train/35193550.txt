After getting turned down for a job, Thom finds his landlord throwing all of his belongings into the hallway. With no job prospects and no place to sleep, he turns to driving his illegal taxicab around the streets of New York. Fortunately for him, Claire Barrow isn't having a good day, either. Her husband is flirting with his secretary and her estranged father has suffered a heart attack in California. In a frenzy, she hails what she assumes to be a cab. What she gets instead ... is Thom. With her life in ruins, Claire decides to pay Thom to drive her out to California and he reluctantly agrees. The path across America takes more than the usual detours and that forces them to choose between the lives they've left behind, and the possibilities glimpsed along their journey
