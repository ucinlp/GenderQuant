"Harsh theatrical monologue by a desperate man. Ray is a crack addict who has not scored for too long. Withdrawal symptoms cloud his paranoid mind. He sharpens his knife to take it out on his girlfriend who fled with his pipe and his crack. Sometimes his cruel and violent sexual fantasies are visualized, but in general the insane verbal ravings of the goaded Ray predominate." Written by Gertjan Zuilhof, Programmer, 27th Rotterdam Film Festival, Netherlands
