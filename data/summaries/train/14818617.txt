The story takes place in the 1950s. Konstantin “Kostik” Romin  has come to Moscow to study history and is staying with kindly aunt Alisa , who runs a communal apartment building there. His life soon becomes intertwined with those of the other residents. Among them are Margarita Pavlovna  and both her former husband Lev Khobotov , a publisher of foreign poetry, and her new beau, engraver-turned-teacher Savva Ignatevich . The main plot revolves around the congenial Khobotov’s attempts to find happiness with newfound love Lyudochka , while constantly being thwarted by the controlling Margarita. Another tenant is musical comedian Arkady Velyurov , who is trying to revive his faltering career and escape from his own loneliness. He has become enamored of a young competitive swimmer, Svetlana , who rebuffs his advances but takes a fancy to the opportunistic Kostik. Kostik finds his own love interest, RitaA diminutive form of "Margarita", a source of some irony; when she introduces herself to a bewildered Khobotov as "Margarita", Kostik interjects "Rita! RI-TA!" , for whom he decides to forsake his playboy lifestyle. In the end he becomes the catalyst for both Khobotov and Velyurov to find some measure of happiness: the former elopes with Lyudochka with the help of Kostik's pal Savransky, and the latter is elated that Svetlana attends one of his concerts in response to a telegram Kostik had urged him to send.
