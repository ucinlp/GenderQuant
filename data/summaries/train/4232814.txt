Kyle LeBlanc  is an American working overseas in Russia. When he hears his wife being attacked over the phone, Kyle rushes home to find that he is too late. The man who has killed his wife is found not guilty on lack of evidence, so Kyle takes the law into his own hands and kills the man to avenge his wife's death. For his crime he is sentenced to life in prison without parole. The Russian prison he is sent to is tough, and the warden amuses himself by putting on fights where he fills his pockets with money by betting on the fights. As Kyle begins to break and go crazy he is forced into these fights because the warden knows he is a sure thing. Kyle's new cellmate 451 , begins to make him think of what he is fighting for. With a renewed purpose, Kyle now knows he must fight another battle; the fight for inner peace, as it is the only way he can become the man he once was. Eventually, a prison riot enables 451 to give Kyle the evidence of all the murders that have happened in this prison for the past 20 something years that he had planned to expose to the US government. While the guards are getting the prisoners under control, 451 shows Kyle a secret passage to the prison garage for their next move. When two guards take Kyle to the garage, 451 launches an attack and kills one of them while Kyle holds the other at gunpoint and pins him down to the ground. After taking the key to free himself, Kyle takes one of the guards uniforms to disguise himself and drives off in one of their cars while 451 stays behind to assassinate the warden for his misdeeds. His fate is unknown, but Kyle is able to return to the US and expose the prison's actions. Three months later, the prison was closed down.
