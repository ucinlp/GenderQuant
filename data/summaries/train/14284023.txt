Mary is a high powered businesswoman who runs her own marketing and business advice company. However, her roots are at the North Pole... yes, she's Santa's daughter. When Santa has some health problems, Mrs. Claus calls Mary in to help get everything ready for the Big Day that is fast approaching. Mary obliges. But, can Mary's successful business techniques really work for the spirited but mentally infantile elves? We'll see. In the meantime, Mary has found her long lost love, Luke, to be still employed as the area's mailman.
