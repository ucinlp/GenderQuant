A novelist  who has abandoned her writing career tracks down the details of a true story from the last days of the Spanish Civil War. The writer and Falangist Rafael SÃ¡nchez Mazas  faced a firing squad along with fifty other prisoners, but managed to escape into the woods. A Republican soldier, apparently one of those searching the area for the escaped prisoner, found him but allowed him to escape. The novelist pieces together the fragments of the story, plagued by contradictions and mysterious characters, and comes to realize that her search for the truth is a personal quest of self-discovery.
