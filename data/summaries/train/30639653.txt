Jason Mackenzie is a rumour, a myth - at least that’s what the police want you to believe. Jason was a normal young Glaswegian until he was mysteriously bestowed with supernatural powers. Now he has the ability to see into the future of anyone he touches, as well as the ability to generate electricity, creating lightning bolts as he fights crime. Superintendent Charles Sloan has formed the F-division, a special team that keeps the truth about monsters and demons from reaching the population. He knows first-hand of Jason’s abilities. His team of two is made up of Detective Inspector Iain Mullan, a rough and ready cop, and Inspector Rebecca Munro. She was promoted to F-division at the age of just 21 after she was able to handle a "supernatural incident" by herself. Now a new danger threatens the city: The Cailleach, an ancient creature in Scottish mythology, who wields magical powers and is believed to have formed Scotland's landscape. It has been freed after years of imprisonment in limbo. Working with Jason’s adversary, Mr. Philips, a corrupt businessman who seeks only power and control, The Caillech threatens to wipe out the world in three days. Jason must focus all of his powers on finding the Caillech and defeating her, all while ensuring the safety of Sloan and his team. And he must also find the connection between Lena, a young medical student from the Highlands, who is attacked by the Caillech’s foot soldiers, the ferocious, demonic Scavenger."NightIsDay.net", accessed 26th January 2011
