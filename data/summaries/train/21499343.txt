Eventually they fall in love, but one day in church a man recognizes Kári as his true identity - the escaped criminal Eyvind of the Hills. Eyvind has to flee to the highlands, and Halla decides to go with him. There they have a child and live happily in love, providing food by hunting and fishing, until one day when Eyvind's old friend Arnas appears, also an outlaw, and falls in love with Halla too. Other people are conspiring to get rid of the criminal as well, and the living conditions for Eyvind and Halla start to become worse and worse.
