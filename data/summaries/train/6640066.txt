Two families stay in identical bungalows, adjacent to each other, tracing their friendship to over forty years. Their respective progenies Chinna and Chella  are childhood buddies, their easy camaraderie and strong bonding carried over to their adult years. The two study in the same college, same class, zoom together on the motorbike, their togetherness at home and college, as accepted a fact as it was in films like 'Piriyadha Varam Vendum', etc. Somewhere along the way, the duo fall in love, throwing some soft glances at each other, when the other is not looking. Their college mate, Karna , makes devious plans to separate the duo and make Chella his. He doesn't seem to have any running feud with Chinna, is quite friendly with the duo, nor does he seem to be particularly in love with Chella. Chinna laps up all that Karna tells him about Chella loving him, and is heartbroken and goes out of station on a business trip. Chella, persuaded by both families to marry an NRI, boldly informs them that she loved Chinna, and would marry him. The two families are of course happy. Chinna returns home and learns of the preparation for his engagement ceremony. Feeling that since Chella loved Karna, it must be family pressure that must have forced her to agree, Chinna backs out. Now it is Chella's turn to be indignant about Chinna's mistrust of her love, and after giving him a piece of her mind, she backs out, with Chinna pleading for acceptance. After a period of separation, during which all ties between the two families are severed, Chella's family soon come to realise that they cannot live without their dearest friends . The two families then reunite.
