Despite the dramatic story elements of child kidnapping, the overall tone of the film mixes comedy and drama. Madeline Fane  is a busy and successful actress who is fiercely devoted to her two-year-old son. One day, little Michael disappears from his crib. Miss Fane avoids speaking to the police at first, then calls upon both law enforcement and her legions of fans for help. One of them, impoverished Molly Prentiss  who is also a single mother, comes to the rescue.
