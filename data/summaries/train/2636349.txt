The story opens with Wong Chi Hang fleeing the Hong Kong police, who are after him for murder. He winds up in Macau, where he takes a job as a cook at the 8 Immortals restaurant. After getting busted for cheating at a game of Mah Jong, Wong kills the owner and the family, taking over the restaurant himself. Meanwhile, the police, led by officer Lee  are called out to a local beach. It seems that a bag of decomposing body parts has washed ashore. The police begin to suspect Wong has both something to do with the washed up body parts and the disappearance of the family. Wong continues to gleefully murder any of his employees who suspect what might be going on . . . disposing of their bodies in a most interesting way. Wong is captured near the middle of the film and placed in jail. The cops need a confession, so they place him in a cell with a relative of one of his victims in the hopes that he can beat it out of Wong. The prison scenes are just as disturbing as the murders that have occurred earlier in the film â€” perhaps more so. What makes them truly unsettling is not merely the violence, but the fact that the viewer begins to sympathize with Wong. It's hard to watch him suffer at the hands of the police and the felons around him and not feel some kind of empathy, despite the fact that he's a brutal murderer . . . and therein lies the true strength of this film.
