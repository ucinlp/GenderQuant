On the last day of the war between the human and the robot army, one of the robots, Omega Doom, is hit in his head and his programming for the destruction of mankind is erased. Some time later, Omega Doom arrives at a destroyed city, where he encounters an unusual community of robots and roms , who are in conflict. He also finds there are two remaining peaceful robots - a former nanny who now works as a bartender and the head of a former teacher, whom the other robots use as a ball. Omega Doom helps The Head find a body and tells him about a rumored stock of hidden weapons. Both groups want these weapons in order to continue the destruction of the remaining humans, since the only weapons left are simple ˝laser chopping knives˝. Eventually, Omega Doom gets the robots to promise to destroy the roms in exchange for a half of the weapons; but he also proposes the same deal to the roms. They end up fighting each other with the new weapons, ensuring their mutual destruction. Afterwards, he leaves the last two peaceful robots  in charge of the city and continues his wandering.
