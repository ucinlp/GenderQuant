I Love Luci is a story of unrequited love, missing teeth and one dog's potential to shape the fortunes of a couple destined never to be together. The story is based on an encounter the writer had outside his office with two methadone patients. The film is based on a direct transcript of a snippet of conversation between a man and woman who were walking up the street by Film City Glasgow. "Ho! Marjory? What's happened to your teeth?", said Tommy... The rest of the story is entirely fictional. Trivia: The dog's name is short for Lucifer.
