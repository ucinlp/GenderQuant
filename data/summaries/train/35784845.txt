A Korean War pilot, Pike Yarnell, a major, survives a jet crash in the Pacific Ocean, as does Donald Beasley, his navigator. After many days on a raft, Donald dies. Christina, the dead officer's widow, waits for a full explanation of the circumstances of Donald's death, as do his wealthy Georgia parents and sister. Pike gives them very few details, however, particularly disturbing Virginie Beasley, who wants a Congressman in the family to seek a Congressional Medal of Honor for her brave son. Pike begins to develop feelings for Christina. He can't bring himself to tell her that Donald was actually a poor officer, under investigation, and a coward aboard the raft. Donald revealed near the end that he never loved his wife and hated his mother. In the end, he used Pike's gun to kill himself.
