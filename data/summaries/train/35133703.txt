Unlike expected themes of films in the contemporary Egyptian cinema, The Difficult Mission deals with a controversial community issue of pesticides and carcinogens which are a major cause for cancer cases in Egypt. The story was extracted from cases in the courts of Alexandria. The court dealt with the recent effects of the trade of those illegal chemicals and the effects on crops and on the people. Also, the film suggests other issues of corruption, such as the power of business elite and politicians to manipulate lives of innocent citizens by illegal trade, murder, and control. The events of the film begin when Hind, a young woman, goes back home after work and three men attack her in an attempt to rape. Then Sami tries to save her and that lead to mistakenly kill of one of them. Sami is jailed, because he was accused of murder instead of self defense. Those events branch out to expose mafia toxic drug trades. At jail, Sami meets Shawqi and forges a friendship that is carried after being imprisoned. Embedded with scenes full of action, Shawqi and Sami are mistakenly involved, with one of the biggest business men in the country, in a case of illegal importers of fertilizers and toxins in the agriculture field. Sami refuses to agree to the crime of toxic fertilizers in the agriculture field and so he decides to use the help of the carcinogenic researcher. Dr. Nesma is the carcinogenic researcher, who refuses to sign an agreement that illegally imports toxic chemicals, therefore she is suspended from work; therefore, she decides to raise this controversial issue to higher authorities.
