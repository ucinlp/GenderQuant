A young woman is gang-raped by a group of construction workers. Five months later, someone dresses up in army fatigue and a motorcycle helmet and sets out on a bloody rampage for revenge. While many locals are killed, the local doctor and sheriff set out to find the killer and unmask him once and for all. After a short chase, the killer suffers a fatal fall on a construction site. The helmet comes off, revealing it to be Bubba, the brother of the rape victim.
