Superstar singer Film is involved in a car accident in the rural, remote mountain forests of northern Thailand. He is rescued by some hill tribe people, but because he has amnesia, he can't remember who he is. A paparazza named Jaa has followed Film. Before the accident, Film and Jaa were enemies, but now he thinks that she is someone he might have loved in his past life brought back to him by the legendary fireflies.
