The film features Byrne as an unnamed, cowboy-hat-wearing stranger who visits the fictional Texas town of Virgil, where he observes the citizens as they prepare for the Celebration of Special-ness to mark the Sesquicentennial  anniversary of the founding of the town and the statehood of Texas. The event is being sponsored by the Varicorp Corporation, a local computer manufacturing plant. Byrne's narration breaks the fourth wall many times in the movie, especially while he is driving around town in his Chrysler LeBaron convertible. Among the unique individuals the stranger meets is * Louis Fyne, , a Country-Western-singing clean room technician at Varicorp who is unlucky in love * Civic leader Earl Culver , who never speaks directly to his wife, Kay  * Miss Rollings , who never leaves her bed * Mr. Tucker , Miss Rollings personal assistant, a voodoo practitioner whom Louis hires to help him find love * A conspiracy theorist preacher  whose shtick owes a great deal to the Church of the SubGenius ; * Ramon , who claims telepathic powers * "The Lying Woman" , who recounts fantastic episodes from her life to anyone listening. Renowned Latin music legend Esteban "Steve" Jordan and his conjunto perform the song "Radio Head" in the film as well.
