Louise Desfontaines , a member of the French Resistance, flees to Spain after her husband is killed, where she is captured and later expatriated to London. She is recruited by the Special Operations Executive , a secret spy and sabotage service initiated by Winston Churchill. Louise is given an urgent first mission: to exfiltrate a British agent who has fallen into German hands while preparing the Invasion of Normandy. The agent has not yet revealed anything but time is pressing. Louise must first create a commando group of women especially chosen for the needs of the operation. When it comes to recruitment, anything goes: lies, blackmail, remission. She first employs Suzy Desprez , a cabaret dancer who excels in the art of seducing men. Then she brings in GaÃ«lle Lemenech , a chemist and explosives expert. Finally she selects Jeanne Faussier , a prostitute capable of killing in cold blood. After their arrival in Normandy, they are joined by Maria Luzzato , an Italian Jew and radio operator. The mission gets underway well, but quickly becomes complicated. Obliged to return to Paris, the SOE gives them a new, almost suicidal objective: to eliminate Colonel Heindrich, one of the key figures of Nazi counter-espionage. He knows too much about the planned landings.
