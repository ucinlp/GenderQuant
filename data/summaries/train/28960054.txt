The following description, was written by Simon Laperrière, a Director and Programmer at the festival, and translated by Rupert Bottenberg, a Montreal-based journalist, was featured in the festival's program catalogue: "A life of crime seems inevitable for Jecko. A mixed-race Québécois with a Haitian background, he witnessed his mother’s death at his father's hands when he was eight years old, an event that scarred him for life. Tossed from one foster family to another, Jecko finally finds the sense of belonging he’s lacked when he starts hanging out with the young hoodlums of the St-Michel neighbourhood. They invite him to join their gang, promising him money and power, everything he’s dreamed of but that he knows polite society will never offer him. For a teenager with few hopes for the future, one highly susceptible to influence, it’s not an offer to refuse. Even if it means bending to the will of a violent and domineering gang leader. Even if his initiation is to kill a stranger. Several years later, crime and violence have brought Jecko to the pinnacle of an underworld empire. In this world where riches and respect are earned with a gun, he feels perfectly at home. A number of events, however, have him reconsidering the path before him. With the option of pulling one final crime, his father due out of prison shortly and hopes of building his own family, it’s time for Jecko to grab the steering wheel of his destiny. But leaving St-Michel won't be so easy.
