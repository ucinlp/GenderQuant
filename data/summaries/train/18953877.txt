On Halloween night, Granny is shopping for candy at a local grocery store. The next customer is an armed robber, who is wearing a blouse and skirt identical to the real Granny. Policemen Daffy and Porky are given the suspect's description and attempt to apprehend the robber. Most of the rest of the cartoon depicts Daffy and Porky confusing Granny with the actual suspect , and bungling said attempts to capture the crook. An annoyed Granny, who has no idea what is going on, mistakes the inept policemen for mischievous trick-or-treaters, while the robber  also foils every attempt by Daffy and Porky. Eventually, Granny figures out what is going on and catches her "double". After giving the suspect a spanking, she hands him over to Officer Flaherty. Flaherty commends Granny for catching the robber, after which Granny tells him "there are two other juvenile delinquents" who should be sent home to their parents , but when she asks for their addresses, Daffy gives her their precinct address and begs her to back off.
