Old MacDonald is tired, and he gets happy as soon as the music starts. The duck snores, causing the rabbit to play by choking the duck. The pig plays the stovepipe like a tuba, and the ewes sing "Mary Had a Little Lamb". He blows smoke on the ewes revealing a blackface gag . The duck is annoyed by the horse, in the end he blows a balloon, with a jar wrap. The cat tries to eat the mouse with a violin, but the mouse plays the harp in his mouth using the cat's whiskers. The horse goes jazzy with the trumpet, and the chicks do the jitterbug, and after the dance sequence, Old Macdonald asks the audience to sing along with the Bouncing Ball to "Old McDonald Had a Farm." Each animal sung is sung in every verse, and the boys and girls alternate, a feature that does not appear in later Screen Songs. Then the animals form a conga line, the iris circle moves in a funny position, and ends with the Paramount logo.
