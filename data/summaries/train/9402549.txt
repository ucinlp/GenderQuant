A kind, yet na√Øve, anthropology student named Shurik  goes to the Caucasus to learn the ancient customs of the locals. While there, he falls in love with Nina . However, Nina's uncle  sells his niece without her knowledge, and arranges to have Nina kidnapped by the eccentric trio: Coward, Fool and Experienced. After a failed attempt, the uncle decides to trick Shurik into helping with the kidnapping, telling him that it is a traditional custom, and that it was Nina's own wish. Shurik goes through with the kidnapping but, after working through his initial confusion, enlists the help of a friend to eventually rescue Nina from her captors.
