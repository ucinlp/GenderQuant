Key Weedon, a pilot with the U.S. Navy, is sent to investigate when an S.O.S. emergency signal is spotted in the San Diego region. He discovers it's the doing of a 6-year-old boy, Grover Martin, whose uncle, a flight officer, gave the boy a blinker light as a gift. The child's mother, Amy, is an attractive widow and Key develops an immediate interest in her. Amy has a blind spot when it comes to Naval officers, however, not wanting a permanent relationship with one because they are constantly on the move. Sure enough, Key gets orders to go overseas, so Amy refuses to go along. Uncle Simon has a new treat for Grover and his brothers. He ties them to balloons and flies them as one would a kite. Grover's tether snaps, however, so he goes floating over San Diego while rescue operations are quickly organized. It turns out to be Key who lowers himself on a rope ladder from a blimp to rescue the boy. A grateful Amy knows that wherever he goes, Key is the man for her.
