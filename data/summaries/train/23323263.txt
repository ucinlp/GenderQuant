Yoram Gross's eighth Dot movie finds us in Australia with Dot and a koala named Gumley dancing and singing in the streets. There are signs that tell of an epidemic that is going around. It is an eye disease and it is spreading fast among the koalas, and it causes blindness and death. Gumley has contracted the disease and he and Dot are trying to raise money so that he can have an operation, but it isn't working. One of the kangaroos suggests that Dot go to Hollywood where she will be able to raise the money in no time. Once in Hollywood Dot meets many famous people and goes to an audition where she will be able to get the money. During her audition Gumley is discovered and taken to the zoo. At the zoo the vet there discovers that he is sick with the disease but is unable to treat Gumley because the zoo just doesn't have the money. Dot arrives at the zoo and with the help of the other animals she manages to get Gumley free and hides. While hiding in the zoo Gumley's condition begins to worsen, but Dot wins the contest and the vet promises to operate on Gumley's eyes. Dot has a lot of practising to go through while Gumley undergoes surgery. The first operation doesn't go very well and doctor hopes that he is strong enough because he will have to have another operation in two days. The operation is a success and Gumley returns to Dot during a performance and they both sing together along with other characters from the movie.
