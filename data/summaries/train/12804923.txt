Donald Duck is having trouble staying warm while sleeping in a remote log cabin in the winter time. He gets out of bed to start a fire but finds he's out of firewood. So he takes his axe and goes outside to chop some more. He chops down the small remains of an already topped tree which happens to be the winter home of the chipmunks Chip and Dale. When Donald takes the log inside the cabin to burn it, the chipmunks follow him. They are first interested in only removing their storage of nuts from the hollow tree, but later decide to take back the tree entirely. They extinguish Donald's fire and blatantly carry the log out of the cabin in front of Donald. But Donald easily takes it from them as they are leaving and locks them out. The chipmunks later extinguish the fire by climbing the roof and throwing snow down the chimney. But soon Donald himself emerges from the chimney, rolls the chipmunks into a snowball and rolls them off the room. At last the chipmunks plan their final revenge. Chip climbs the steep hill just outside Donald's cabin and rolls a snowball down the hill towards the front door. Dale meanwhile knocks on the door to get Donald to answer. As the snowball rolls down the hill, it gets bigger and gains momentum. Finally Donald answers the door just as the massive snowball hits. Chip and Dale then retrieve their log, and as they are leaving, Dale takes a last opportunity to kick Donald as he is helplessly embedded in the snowball having his rear end exposed.
