Jason Ritter plays a video store clerk who works persistently to draw out a reclusive woman, played by Marianna Palka who often comes to the video store where he works and rents soft-core porn. Eventually, despite his strong optimism, her dislike of sex and resulting defensiveness drives them apart. It is revealed toward the end of the film that her dislike of both sex and relationships was fueled by sexual abuse at the hands of her father. It is implied throughout the film that this began early in her life, and continued into her adolescence. This abuse and most likely its large amounts of evidence are what causes her father to take care of all her needs such as her apartment, food, and other expenses. The film ends with a confrontation with her father, and ultimately Ritter's character reuniting with her, implying that she is prepared to be in a relationship with him. The film contains cameo appearances by Elisabeth Waterston and Katherine Waterston, daughters of Law & Order star and veteran actor, Sam Waterston. Tom Arnold has a short but significant role as "The Dick". Jason Ritter's brother Tyler Ritter has a brief appearance, Nancy Morgan also makes an appearance as a waitress. Bryce Dallas Howard and husband Seth Gabel also make cameo appearances.
