The brutish El Turu  captains La León, the town ferry. He views Álvaro as a threat, bullying him almost constantly. However, as the film progresses, El Turu's hidden attraction to Álvaro becomes obvious.La León | 2007 Seattle International Film Festival | Santiago Otheguy | ArgentinaProgram - Sydney Film FestivalLa León Yahoo!
