Fugitive Lee Leslie is wanted by three groups; the police, the gangsters who fear his testimony in court and the insurance company that carries a $1,000,000 policy on him and is anxious to protect its interests by seeing that Leslie stays alive. The company assigns Dan Miller to find Leslie. A night club singer, Ruby Patterson the beneficiary of his will, tips the gangsters as to his whereabouts. He escapes but the gang kidnaps his sister Janet and his mother. His plan to surrender to the police now depends on being able to rescue them first.
