During his travels, Tora-san meets Ikenouchi, a drunken old man whom he assumes is poor and homeless. Tora-san takes the old man home. When he wakes up, Ikenouchi begins ordering Tora-san's family around in such an authoritarian manner that no one can muster the courage to suggest he leave. On the road again, Tora-san meets Botan, a geisha who has lost her life savings to a dishonest customer. He and his family's neighbor are determined to help her out. It later turns out that Ikenouchi is a famous artist and a drawing he has made for Tora-san is worth Â¥70,000.<ref name  http://www.kinejun.jp/cinema/id/18537 |title2010-01-18|languageKinema Junpo}}<ref name Stuart |last Stuart Galbraith IV|urlTora-san 17: Tora-san's Sunrise and Sunset  |date2010-01-18|publisherhttp://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/305548|title2010-01-18|publisher=British Film Institute}}
