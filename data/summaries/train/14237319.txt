The marriage of Faith and George Dunlap is in serious trouble. From a distance, it would seem a picture of domestic bliss, a successful author with a beautiful wife and four daughters living in a converted farmhouse that he helped refurbish himself. But a crisis has come to all involved. George has a mistress, Sandy, and wants to be with her. The trouble is, he doesn't want Faith to be with someone else in return. George is trying to find the courage to leave home, but hates the thought of his family and possessions in another man's hands. The handsome Frank Henderson is hired by Faith to construct a tennis court. It is not clear whether she develops true feelings for Frank or simply wishes to even the score with her unfaithful husband, but for whatever reason, Faith begins an affair. Their daughters resent George for breaking up the family this way. Faith puts up a false facade, planning to attend an evening in George's honor as he accepts a book award, but George becomes increasingly irrational as the women in his life prepare for a life without him.
