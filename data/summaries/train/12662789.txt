A young shop assistant named Clara Manni  is selected by movie executive Gianni  for his new film, Woman without Destiny. When test screenings reveal that the public is enamoured with Clara, but less enthusiastic about the film itself, producer Ercole  sees an opportunity to take advantage of his actress' shapely presence and spice the film up a bit, with less attention to detail and more overt displays of passion. Clara becomes compromised when she marries Gianni, who becomes jealous over the provocative marketing for her film, and categorically states that he doesn't want her involved with it anymore. She reluctantly agrees, and after requesting a more serious vehicle for her, they set about on a new version of the daunting trial of Joan of Arc, with Gianni in the director's chair. The film is panned when premiered at the Venice Film Festival, and with both their reputations in tatters, Clara is forced to evaluate their marriage and the career that she has embarked upon.
