The story revolves around a 19th century theatre troupe in Paris specializing in gory, naturalistic horror plays in the fashion of the Grand Guignol. The director, Cesar Charron , is presenting Poe's "Murders in the Rue Morgue". Cesar's wife, the actress Madeline , whose mother  had been murdered by axe, is haunted by nightmares of an ax-wielding man. Then, suddenly, Rene Marot , a former lover of Madeline's mother thought long dead after being horribly disfigured on stage, mysteriously returns and begins murdering members and ex-members of the acting troupe, confounding the Paris police, who initially suspect Cesar.
