During World War II, German submarines are sinking thousands of tons of British merchant shipping. British intelligence, based in India, believe information is being passed to the U-Boats by a radio transmitter hidden on board one of three German ships interned in Portuguese Goa. Since Portugal is neutral, the ships cannot be attacked by conventional forces. British intelligence approach a territorial unit of aging British expatriates, the Calcutta Light Horse, to carry out the mission on their behalf.
