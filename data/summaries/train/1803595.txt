Scott stars as Dr. John Russell, a composer living in New York City who moves cross-country to Washington state following the deaths of his wife and daughter in a traffic accident while on a winter vacation in upstate New York. In suburban Seattle, Russell rents a large, old and eerie Victorian-era mansion and begins piecing his life back together. However, Dr. Russell soon discovers that he has unexpected company in his new home - the ghost of a murdered child. It shatters windows, abruptly opens and shuts doors, and manifests itself during a seance. Russell investigates and finds that the mystery is linked to a powerful local family, the heir of which is a wealthy United States senator, Joseph Carmichael. Dr. Russell learns that the real Joseph Carmichael was murdered by his father. Joseph was a crippled, sickly child, and in the event of his death, the family fortune would pass to his mother's side of the family. Desperate to keep control of the fortune, Joseph's father drowned young Joseph in the bathtub, secretly replaced him with a healthy orphan, and took him to Europe in the guise of seeking a treatment or cure. He returned several years later with the imposter, now grown and "cured" of his illness, and continued as if nothing had happened. But now the ghost of the real Joseph was haunting the house to get Dr. Russell to investigate the murder, and bring forth justice.
