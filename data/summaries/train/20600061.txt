The Pink Panther joins a construction crew at a building site, where his inexperience causes a series of disasters. By slamming a door, he repeatedly ruins a worker's wall-plaster work as the plaster liquefies due to the noise of the slamming door and spills off the wall. Looking for a place to dispose of trash, the panther removes hot rivets from a bucket and pours them into a workman's hard hat; when the man puts the hat on, he experiences scorching pain. The final blow emerges when the Pink Panther tries to move a steel girder, which hits a wooden beam being carried by one of the workers and triggers a chain-reaction of collisions that destroys the foundations of the building. The Pink Panther flees the enraged construction workers, who give chase.
