This drama highlights the social problems of single parents struggling to raise children and Leslie Cheung was given the role of a retired fund-manager Wing who lost his entire fortune in a financial mishap and was severely depressed until he discovered an abandoned baby boy in his yacht which he has not sold off at that time. He sought to raise the baby as his own son, encountering many happy moments even though he was not financially sound. His happiness is cruelly cut short a few years later as the now toddler's real mother returns and wishes to raise her own son again, while he attempts to prevent this as he loved his stepson very much. The final touching scene depicts the inevitable as his beloved stepson followed his mother into her luxury car while Wing was fighting back tears despite him voluntarily relenting into allowing the kid to leave.
