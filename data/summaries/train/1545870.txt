Nola Darling  is a young, attractive, sexually-independent Brooklynite who juggles three suitors: the polite and well-meaning Jamie Overstreet ; the self-obsessed model Greer Childs ; and the immature, motor-mouthed bicycle messenger Mars Blackmon . Nola is attracted to the best in each of them, but refuses to commit to any of them, cherishing her personal freedom instead, even though each man wants her for himself.
