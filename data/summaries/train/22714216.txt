The story revolves around Uma  who wrongly assumes that her love is reciprocated by Charly , the happy-go-lucky boy she grows up with. She realizes her mistake when Charly leaves to learn music and returns with Manasi([[Sneha the girl who sings with him. Uma then decides to be independent of Charly. But very soon Charly too starts realising Uma's place in his life. Kunchacko Boban, who had been used by directors to do western dance, got a chance to show off his classical dance skills through this film. His sensitive portrayal of a man caught between his love for dance and music and a girl who dotes on him is excellent. Sujitha, the child artiste who was discovered by Fazil in Varsham Pathinaaru, gave a very fine performance. This film has some very good music by Sanjay-Antra, the son-daughter duo of Salil Chowdury and the choreography by Kala was applauded.
