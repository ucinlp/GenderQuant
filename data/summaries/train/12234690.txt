The warrior Deathstalker is sent by a witch on a quest to find a chalice, an amulet, and a sword, two of which are held by the wicked sorcerer Munkar . Deathstalker finds the sword almost immediately, which has been hidden by the witch in a cave. Sword in hand, Deathstalker sets out to Munkar's castle. On his journey, Deathstalker learns of a tournament from Oghris , a charming warrior in midriff-baring armor. Munkar has invited warriors to participate in contests until a winner is determined, thereby inheriting Munkar's kingdom. Along the way to the tournament, the pair meet Kaira, a female warrior  who wears only a G-string and a cloak, who joins them on their journey. Arriving at Munkar's castle, Deathstalker and the other tournament participants are invited to get drunk and rape Munkar's harem slaves, including Princess Codille . Deathstalker rescues Princess Codille, briefly, but Munkar takes her back. The tournament continues for several days, while Deathstalker searches for the other two artifacts at night. Eventually, nearly all of the other contestants have killed each other, and Deathstalker faces Munkar and defeats him.
