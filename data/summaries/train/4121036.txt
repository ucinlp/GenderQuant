Syd ([[Chris Evans  awakens from the latest in a long series of drug- and booze-fueled benders when he received a phone call from a friend informing him that his ex-girlfriend London  will be moving away to California with her new boyfriend in a few days, and that a going-away party is being thrown for her that evening. Although not invited to the bash, Syd decides to attend anyway, bringing along Bateman , a smartly dressed banker who delivers cocaine to Syd as a favor to their mutual dealer. After arriving at the party at the condominium belonging to the parents of a club girl Rebecca , the enigmatic Bateman and Syd install themselves in the bathroom, where they snort line after line of coke, while guzzling tequila and attempting to discuss philosophical matters regarding love, sex, women and pain. Over the course of the night and a massive pile of blow, Bateman schools the desperately self-involved Syd to see the errors of his ways. The private party-within-a-party is soon joined by Maya  and Mallory , who feign sympathy with Syd to grab some free blow. When Syd learns that London has arrived, Bateman challenges him to go out and talk to her. After a heated confrontation in the middle of the party, Syd and London decide to leave to talk somewhere more private. As they are leaving, a fight ensues in which Syd and Bateman fight the other male guests, barely making it out of the party. After a little while they make up in Syd's car and have sex later in London's apartment. In the last scene, at the airport, Syd says "I love you". Although this impresses London deeply, she still leaves him.
