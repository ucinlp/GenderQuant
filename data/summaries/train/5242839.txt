Thakur Rakesh Singh is married to a lovely woman named Geeta. Geeta falls ill when Rakesh is abroad, prompting him to return. But he returns only to see Geeta dying, resulting in him going in a state of depression. He even builds a statue in her memory. Some time later, a criminal named Sunaina, who is the wife of dacoit Ranjit Singh, gets arrested along with her gang. But to everybody's astonishment, she claims that she is the dead Geeta. Rakesh goes to see her and finds that Sunaina indeed looks like Geeta, but he is unable to believe her. Sunaina tells her all the things only Geeta could have known. She tells that real Sunaina was her twin sister running away from Ranjit and life of crime. It was Sunaina who fell ill and died. Everybody thought that Geeta was dead, and she played along, to stop both Rakesh and Ranjit from knowing the truth. Nevertheless, Rakesh drags her into the court, hoping to learn and confirm the truth. Sunaina's claims seem to be genuine, until Rakesh asks her about a diary of Geeta, which is missing. Sunaina is unable to find the diary, whose location was known only to her and Rakesh. Fully convinced that Geeta is indeed dead and Sunaina is an impostor, Rakesh has her convicted. That same night, somebody breaks into Rakesh's household. Rakesh is ready, as he has assumed that Ranjit will come to his home to kill him. Police are already in the hiding to arrest Ranjit. In the skirmish that follows, Ranjit tries to flee, but is fatally shot by the police. Before dying, Ranjit tells Rakesh that the woman he sent in jail is indeed Geeta. Ranjit dies in the arms of Geeta and Rakesh, thus uniting the spouses again.
