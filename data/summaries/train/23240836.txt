Raffles  is an English gentleman with a secret life&mdash;he is the notorious jewel thief known as "The Amateur Cracksman". While sailing from India to England accompanied by his friend, Bunny Manners , it is rumored that the infamous cracksman is aboard ship. Raffles warns a lady passenger to keep an eye on her necklace, which is stolen soon afterward. Although a search reveals no evidence, the necklace is returned upon reaching London. Lord Amersteth  and his wife, Lady Amersteth , are having a party at their home and Raffles attends. Another guest, noted criminologist Captain Bedford , makes the assertion that a very valuable string of pearls cannot be stolen. Encouraged by this, Raffles steals it. He has also stolen the heart of Gwendolyn Amersteth , the daughter of his hosts. Capt. Bedford finally captures him, but he escapes with Gwendolyn's help and they run away to be married. Raffles returns the pearls and promises to retire from being a burglar.
