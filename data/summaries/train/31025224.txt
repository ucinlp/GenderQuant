In a mansion outside a nameless city , live the wealthy Valverde family: the patriarch Miguel is a business man; Emilia, his wife, is a fun and good-hearted but slightly deranged woman; and their two daughters Suzi and Lala. Emilia often picks up tramps in hope to reform them into productive men, but they always disappear stealing anything they can in the house. In the surrounding woods, Alberto Medina, a famous songwriter, is on a vacations hunting trip. While the old car he is driving falls off a wreckage he has to walk to find help and ends up in the Valverde's home, but for his dirty and ragged clothes Emilia takes him for a tramp and invites him to stay with them. For some inexplicable reason Alberto accepts, despite the protests of Emilia's family and their butler, but in the next days he proves to be more than a regular homeless man: helping Miguel when he arrives home drunk, enchanting the heart of Suzi, and especially during a business dinner where he secures Miguel a financial investment support from a bank manager, but also making Suzi jealous after the manager's daughter, Patricia, insists on dating him the next day. Alberto ends up having a date with Patricia, first at a country club and later to an undisclosed place. During that day two policemen find the destroyed car at the wreckage and find the owner, who confirms that Alberto was riding the car and they assume he died in the accident. Alberto goes back to the Valverde's later that night and realizes he has no key so he falls asleep in the back room. The next morning when they look for Alberto they don't find him in the bedroom, then Miguel reads a note in the newspaper where they inform he died in a car accident, causing a chaotic chain of faints and madness around the house. During the confusion Alberto finally finds Suzi  and kisses her declaring their love.
