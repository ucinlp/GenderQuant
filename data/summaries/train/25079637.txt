The Black Widows, a teenage girl gang, find one of their number killed; they suspect Barbara, sometime girlfriend of the leader of rival gang The Vandals. As the gangs prepare for a rumble, we glimpse the members' home lives, exaggerating every type of Family dysfunction; but that of their "average American" quarry is no better. Full of shadowy urban night scenes.
