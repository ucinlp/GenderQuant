When the rule-enforcing camp director at Camp Bleeding Dove gets struck by lightning, the counselors find themselves in sole charge of their campers, and themselves. The diverse group of college freshmen counselors create a camp experience that their campers will never forget. They stray from the rules and create a fun, yet crazy and often irresponsible environment. Each counselor, and some of the campers, find themselves maturing in their own way, yet are still able to create an interesting bond with each other that can only happen at summer camp.
