Joan Howell intends to be an actress, but for now she's working as a maid. Three different times, she accidentally bumps into Tom Milford, a successful publishing executive, who then asks her for a date. Ashamed of her own modest home, Joan invites him to the lavish apartment of one of her clients, pretending it is hers. What she doesn't know, because she and her employer have never met, is that the apartment is Tom's. He is shocked to find himself being welcomed to his own place. To see how far Joan is prepared to go, Tom moves in with his pal Harvey and goes along with it. As soon as Joan becomes aware of the truth, however, she gets even by throwing a party with girls pretending to be prostitutes, whereupon the party is promptly raided by the cops.
