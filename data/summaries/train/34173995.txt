Mr Peterson is an anxious supply teacher who takes a job at an underachieving primary school, St Bernadette's. He struggles to care for both his uninspired pupils, and his heavily pregnant wife. He lives in the shadow of his overachieving 'golden boy' identical twin brother, who is a teacher at a posh private school, St. Cuthbert's College.{{cite news}} The brothers' rivalry intensifies when they both enter their classes into the national 'Sing a Song for Christmas' competition. Mr Shakespeare  and Oakmore are back as well, hoping to win the competition. Mr Peterson ends up taking his class  on an unauthorised school trip to the competition's location at Christmas Castle, but they become lost, and embark on an epic trip across the country, travelling by any means necessary. Mr Peterson calls the help of Mr Poppy and together they must use all their resources and do whatever they can to guide the pupils to safety and reach Christmas Castle, if they are to win the competition.
