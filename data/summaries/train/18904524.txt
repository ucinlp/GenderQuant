A hurricane hits the isle of Jamaica in 1870. The parents of five children feel it is time to send them to England for a more civilized upbringing and education. During the voyage, pirates board the ship and take the children captive. The pirate captain, Chavez, takes an immediate liking to young Emily, and decides to sail to Tampico and leave the kids safely with a woman there named Rosa, a brothel madam with a good heart. Rosa warns the pirates that the law is after them. Since they are innocent of the crimes attributed to them by the authorities—namely, the murder of all the children—Chavez and his first mate  are unconcerned. But then one of the children, John, slips from a window of the brothel and falls to his death. Chavez doesn't wish any more harm to come to the young ones so he refuses to attack a Dutch vessel that comes into view. But his men mutiny, seize the Dutch boat and capture its captain. Seeing him come toward her with a knife, which he wants her to use to cut his ropes and set him free, Emily instead stabs the Dutch captain and kills him. Not long thereafter, the pirates are captured by British sailors and brought to trial. Under questioning in court, Emily places the responsibility on Chavez instead of on herself. The pirates are hanged.
