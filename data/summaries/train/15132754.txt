Pinky Saxena, a mere child, has been traumatized by the brutal killing of her mom, Sharda, and dad, Inspector Ravi Saxena, at the hands of Jhakha and Shakha, so much that she is hysterical and has to be institutalized. Her only relative is Raja Saxena, who has sworn to avenge this killing. He begins by calling himself Johnny, and getting a reputation as a thief and killer. He is accepted into the gang by Shakha and preparations are made for him to be introduced to Jhakha. Before he could meet Jhakha, Johnny is apprehended and arrested by Inspector Shekar, who has also sworn to apprehend Jhakha. Raja is able to get away by identifying himself as his brother, with a false identification. But will this escapade result in him avenging the brutal killings, or will they merely entangle him hopelessly with Inspector Shekar and the law?
