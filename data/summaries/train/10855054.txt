The film tells the story of the Tuskegee experiment, a U.S. Federal Government secret medical experiment on poor African Americans in the years 1932-1972, designed to study the effects of untreated syphilis. The story is told from the perspective of the small town nurse Eunice Evers  who is well aware of the lack of treatment, but feels her role is to console the involved men, many of whom are her direct friends.
