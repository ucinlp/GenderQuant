Set and filmed on location in the tenement section of New York's Lower East Side, the film tells the story of a young boy, Tommy Woodry , who has a habit of crying wolf. Late one night, he climbs up the building fire escape and sees his two seemingly normal neighbours, Mr and Mrs Kellerson, murder a drunken sailor in their apartment. No one, neither the boy's parents or the police, believe young Tommy when he tells them what he has seen, since they all assume that this is just another of the boy's tall tales. The murderous neighbors find out that the boy is a witness to the killing and plan the same for him when his parents are away. The two of them take Tommy to a dark alley, where they try to kill him. Tommy escapes, but the pair re-capture him, taking him back to their apartment. Tommy escapes again, onto the roof, pursued by Mr Kellerson.
