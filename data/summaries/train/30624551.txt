Heinrich Faust  is eaten up by his longing for enlightening. He seeks to understand the very nature of life and how it makes the world go round. Driven by his burning desire for cognition he even unearths corpses and rummages in their guts just to localize the home of the soul. While he keeps on telling himself "in the beginning was the word" he gets to know the racketeer Mauricius (Anton Adassinsky, playing a wordly version of Mephistopheles, who eventually contradicts him: "In the beginning was the deed". In spite of being amorphic Mauricius considers himself an Ã¼bermensch. Faust's obscure new friend takes him to the twilight zones of their small town. In a bath his attention is caught by the young Margarete  also known as "Gretchen". Later the two new friends are entangled in a carousal. During a subsequent brawl Faust accidentally kills Gretchen's brother. Faust becomes obsessed with Gretchen who appears to embody the beauty of blooming life. He indulges himself in thinking that studying her would be reasonable as a part of his research about what makes all the difference between life and death. When the aging Faust has become irreversibly infatuated with Gretchen, Mephistopheles offers him to let him have her. Faust cannot resist the idea of spending a night with Gretchen. Yet Mauricius demands nothing less than Faust's soul in return. Faust even has to sign the contract with his own blood. Now living on borrowed time, Faust can hit on Gretchen but he is haunted by penitence and fear. Finally Faust cannot bear Mauricius' nihilistic comments anymore. Overwhelmed with wrath he puts Mauricius down and finds himself lost in the middle of nowhere.
