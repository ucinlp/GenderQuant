A magician named Ali Bahma is nailing self-promoting posters on every conceivable surface, including a tree in which Bugs is living. He protests having his home enroached and his right to private property compromised, until the magician apologises and offers Bugs blackberry pie. The rabbit's expression momentarily changes to joy as Ali Bahma magically brandishes a pie from underneath his cloth, then splatters it in Bugs's face. As the magician walks away saying "What a dumb bunny!", Bugs, with the bits of filling and crumbled crust from the pie on his face, calmly turns to the audience and, having decided that it is time to pay Ali Bahma back, says his famous Groucho Marx-inspired catchphrase: "Of course you realize, this means war!" For the rest of the film's storyline, Bugs enacts his revenge in the theater where Ala Bahma is performing. The rabbit wreaks havoc during the magician's prestidigitations by heckling him, upstaging him, and interrupting his performance with a mixture of comic violence and his own bizarre cartoon magic. After his revenge, he brandishes his own pie. He says to the audience, quoting Red Skelton's "Mean Widdle Kid", "If I dood it, I dit a whippin'... I DOOD IT!" and splatters the pie in Ala Bahma's face. Bugs sings "Aloha 'Oe" on a ukelele as he descends into the hat upon iris-out.
