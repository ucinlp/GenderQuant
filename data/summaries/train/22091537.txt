Mechanic Terry Martin , the chief car tester for Emery Motors is working on a revolutionary design for a new carburetor. Engineer Frank Lawson is a rival for the attention of Jane Mitchell  who has just been hired to work in the publicity department. The new carburetor proves to be troublesome as Martin cannot get it to work correctly. Terry and his fellow mechanic "Gadget"  have to endure the addition of Lawson to the team. Having an engineer who is in charge is galling as Lawson believes only he has the solution. When their car is entered in the Indianapolis 500 race, it ends up crashing. While Martin and "Gadget" are recovering from their injuries, Miss Mitchell goes to bat for Martin, since she is secretly the boss's niece. In a new car designed for a world speed record at the Muroc, California dry lake bed, Martin proves the carburetor works, but nearly loses his life in the attempt. When a fuel pipe cracks, choking fumes are funneled into the cockpit causing the record run to end prematurely. With only moments to spare, Lawson drives the race car, conveying an injured Martin to the Muroc hospital at high speed. Martin is finally vindicated and wins the girl as well.
