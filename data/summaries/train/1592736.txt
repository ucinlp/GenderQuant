Peluca follows its main character, Seth, as he skips school with two of his friends to buy a fanny pack and a wig . The Seth character was later adapted into Napoleon Dynamite for the full-length film of the same name. Both were played by Jon Heder. The character that later becomes Pedro SÃ¡nchez in Napoleon Dynamite is named Giel in Peluca. The plot of Peluca is vaguely similar to that of its successor, and features some of the same camera shots as Napoleon Dynamite. For example, in the beginning of both films, Heder stands outside waiting for a bus. The film is almost nine minutes long and was shot on black-and-white 16mm film. It is included on the Napoleon Dynamite Special Edition DVD.
