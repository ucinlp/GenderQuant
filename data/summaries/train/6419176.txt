Chasing the Horizon takes a look at a team's preparation for the Tecate SCORE Baja 1000, one of the most grueling off-road racing events in the world. It is known as such because of the extreme conditions which the race is set in, the length of the race, and spectators have even been known to set up booby traps on the course for their own entertainment. The team that the film takes a look at is a rookie trio called Team Horizon. Milo Brown is an ex-con and junkyard owner but is also the team's captain. Jeff Lloyd was once a homeless man who went on to become a millionaire and racecar driver. Toby O'Mara serves as the team chief mechanic and co-driver but he is also a plumber. The three men come together and form a sort of dysfunctional family to compete in this grand event. The film takes a look at the ups and downs of the crews experiences in the days that lead up to the actual race and the viewer sees moments of laughter and comedy but also times of sadness.
