The opening scenes of the movie center on MacGuffin, a deranged occultist, whose life has been dedicated to vengeance after being trampled and rendered a paraplegic as a child by overzealous revelers in the throes of bead-catching madness. With the help of a Sumerian Goddess MacGuffin performs a ritual that raises Zombie!  from his grave. Zombie! embarks on a killing spree in New Orleans during the Mardi Gras festivities. A trio of filmmakers get word of this and hasten to capture Zombie! on film. Renaissance genius Galileo, newly pardoned by Pope John Paul II and thus released from Purgatory, also chases Zombie! through New Orleansâ€™ crowded streets. Meanwhile, a zaftig ninja vows to take down the undead menace. The film is peppered with comedy sketches and sight gags more or less unrelated to the plot, including numerous shots of bare-breasted women flashing the Mardi Gras crowds.
