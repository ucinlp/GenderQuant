Robert "Bob" Davis  is an American dancer who is looking for a job in Buenos Aires after gambling away his money. Bob's friend, bandleader Xavier Cugat, invites him to perform at a wedding in order to catch the eye of the bride's father, Eduardo Acuña , the owner of a local nightclub. Acuña's four daughters prepare for the wedding of the eldest. According to family tradition, the sisters must wed from oldest to youngest. The beautiful Maria , who is next in line, is notoriously picky with her suitors, much to the dismay of her two younger siblings. During the reception, Bob tries to catch Maria's attention, but his advances are rebuffed. While in conversation with Acuña, Bob remarks that Maria's personality is like "the inside of a refrigerator," quickly losing favor with his potential employer. Acuña decides to address Maria's relationship woes and begins sending orchids and love notes to her from an unknown suitor, with the hope that she will eventually find a beloved. One day, Bob delivers the note and flower. Maria, who has become enamored with her secret admirer, sees Bob leaving and concludes that he is her suitor. Maria asks her father to introduce them, and Acuña reluctantly agrees. He makes a deal with Bob: in exchange for performing at the club, Bob will play the part of the suitor and repel Maria with his "obnoxious" personality. Despite Bob's efforts to disillusion Maria, she grows attracted to him, and the two quickly fall in love. With his plan gone awry, Acuña orders Bob to leave Buenos Aires and composes a farewell love note on his behalf. Acuña's wife sees him writing the note and suspects him of cheating on her, drawing the whole family in with her discovery. Bob is forced to reveal the truth in front of Maria, who feels shocked and betrayed. Impressed by Bob's behavior, Acuña grants him permission to court Maria. After a series of romantic gestures, Maria finally forgives Bob, and the two reconcile.
