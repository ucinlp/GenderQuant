South Korea, 13 October 1990. Following President Roh Tae-woo's declaration of a crackdown on organized crime, Busan businessman Choi Ik-hyun  is arrested for embezzling billions of won from hotel construction companies, and is also charged with intimidation, kidnapping and assault. Busan public prosecutor Jo Beom-seok  is in charge of the investigation, and especially the murder of hotelier Heo Sam-shik  by mobster Kim Pan-ho , with whom Ik-hyun allegedly was connected. Back in March 1982, Choi was a Busan customs officer who, along with colleagues, was already taking bribes and pilfering goods. After discovering 10 kilograms of heroin in a warehouse one night, he and colleague Jang Ju-im  approach a friend of Jang's, gangster Choi Hyung-bae , to sell it to Japan's yakuza, with whom Hyung-bae has ties. Ik-hyun discovers that the younger Hyung-bae is also a member of the same Choi family clan from Gyeongju and the two form a close relationship. Ik-hyun leaves his customs job and becomes a full-time businessman, with Hyung-bae taking care of the underworld side and Ik-hyun protecting him with his high-level contacts. In the mid-'80s the two forcibly take over a nightclub run by Miss Yeo  that is on the turf of Pan-ho. Following his humiliation, Pan-ho has the club raided by the police and Hyung-bae arrested, though Ik-hyun gets Hyung-bae released by using the Choi clan connection with Seoul public prosecutor Choi Joo-dong . In May 1987, Ik-hyun and Hyung-bae take their business to the next level, formally linking up with Japan's yakuza and having a connection with a hotel-casino, the Daedong, that is also on Pan-ho's turf. Pan-ho threatens a gang war with Hyung-bae, and Ik-hyun is forced to decide where his loyalties and self-survival lie.{{cite web}}
