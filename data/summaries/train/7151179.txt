Alby Sherman  is a Jewish man whose father dies when he was young. He and his mother  run a candy store in Brooklyn, but Alby dreams of opening his own restaurant in Manhattan, a project which is very expensive. Finding the perfect location, a restaurant whose owner is moving to another location, he asks his wealthy Uncle Benjamin  to lend him the money. His uncle imposes an odious blackmail on him: Alby will have the money only if he leaves his "shikse" Catholic girlfriend  and get married to a "nice Jewish girl" .
