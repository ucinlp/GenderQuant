A charming British anthropology Professor Bruce Patterson  has to live with Helen Bushmill , his fianc√©e. Helen is away traveling, and has failed to tell him that she has a seventeen-year-old daughter Libby , who shows up at her mother's home unaware that Helen in engaged. Meanwhile he has to resist the advances of the neighbourhood ladies who barge in unexpectedly. At the same time, Patterson must deal with the continual invasions of his cynical neighbor, and law student, Mike , who soon develops a crush on Libby. Intertwined in the story is Mike's persistent dachshund, determined to bury the professor's prize possession of a rare dinosaur bone. In an interview with Peter Bogdanovich, Tashlin said he included the dachshund as a satire on CinemaScope due to the dog's shape.Bogdanovich, Who the Devil Made It? 1998 Ballantine Books
