Undercover government agent Mark Sheldon ([[Robert Wilcox  agrees to be "framed" on a murder charge so he can be sent to prison. With his criminal "credentials" established, Sheldon is paroled to work in a mine on an isolated Pacific island owned by Stephen Danel . The government wants to learn if, as rumored, Danel mistreats his workers. Once on the island, Sheldon quickly finds himself subjected to the harsh conditions of a slave-labor camp. He also meets Danel's beautiful young wife, Lorraine , who -- despite her jewels and stylish wardrobe -- is every bit as much a prisoner as the men sweating in the mine. Once Danel discovers Sheldon's true identity, the agent must work quickly to save his own life and to free the captives.
