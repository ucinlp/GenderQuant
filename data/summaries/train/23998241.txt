Following the death of the owner of the Hunt ranch, foreman Tom Foster  assumes responsibility for the property, taking also into his care Eleanor Hunt , the beautiful daughter of the late owner. Although he falls in love with the girl, Tom is too diffident to express his feelings and propose marriage. Soon after, Eleanor is asked to accompany her aunt to Europe. Two years later, Eleanor returns from Europe with condescending airs, accompanied by Denman , her wealthy European fianc√©e. Eleanor announces that she plans to hold the wedding at the ranch, which has been renovated by Tom and transformed into a successful tourist destination. Tom's friend, Mack , tells Tom about the rakish exploits of Don Juan, hoping to instill in him a bit of romance. Wanting to eliminate any competition, Denman instructs his men to kidnap Tom and keep him prisoner until after the wedding. Tom is knocked on the head and dreams that he is the fabled Juan, fighting like a lion for love. When he wakes up, Tom frees himself from his bonds and rides back to the ranch, where he arrives just in time to prevent the wedding. Afterwards, Tom and Eleanor are married.
