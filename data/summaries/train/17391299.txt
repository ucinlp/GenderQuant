Madhav Apte is a common man with strong principles. He has strong values and does not believe in bending any rules for anybody, even when the future of his children is involved. He fights with people around when he sees injustice and corruption, which include his colleagues, his boss, shop keepers, school principal and even his wife. His principles and his behavior is a cause of fights between his wife and him. She is tired of him only preaching of changing the world but not doing anything about it. He is pushed to a corner by everybody who finds his path of righteousness too difficult to handle, and one day he snaps. He goes on a rampage trying to do right, everything that goes against his principles and then starts a mayhem on the streets of Mumbai, ultimately ending in a tragic climax.
