When the East Side Kids rescue Sylvia from the clutches of her abusive stepfather Morley, who is knocked out cold by Mugs with the broken leg from a chair, they have no idea of the danger in which they are getting themselves into. The Kids take Sylvia to their clubhouse to hide out and Morley is killed by racketeer McGaffey for stealing his money. When McGaffey spots the broken leg, he takes it with him and uses the 'incriminating evidence' to extort the East Side Kids into working for him. Danny, as a favor to Sylvia, runs back to her apartment to gather some of her clothes, however, he is caught by a police officer who arrests him under the suspicion of murder. McGaffey forces Mugs to break into a silk warehouse in exchange for the chair leg, which he used to knock Morley out cold while helping Sylvia, which has his fingerprints on it and could point the police in his direction for the murder.
