The body of Myrtle Gunsaulus, a young African American girl, is discovered in the basement of a New York City factory. Arthur Gilpin, the African-American janitor who discovered the body, is arrested and charged with her murder. Arthurâ€™s sister Ida May  contacts her former boyfriend, the attorney Sidney Wyeth , to defend Gilpin in court. During the trial, Wyeth redirects attention for the murder away from Gilpin to Anthony Brisbane, a white man with a history of sexual deviancy. Gilpin is exonerated while Brisbane is revealed as Myrtle Gunsaulus' killer.
