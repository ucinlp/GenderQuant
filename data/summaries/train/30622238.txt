The dapper musical comedy favorite, Jack Buchanan is practically the whole show in The Gang's All Here. Buchanan plays John Forrest, a top investigator for the Stamford Insurance Company. Retiring from the firm, Forrest intends to devote the rest of his life to writing detective fiction, but this plan goes out the window when his former employers are robbed of $1,000,000 in jewels belonging to foreign potentate Prince Homouska . With the help of his befuddled brother Treadwell , Forrest follows the trail of clues to American gangster boss Alberni , capturing his quarry with a variety of slapstick subterfuges. Released in the US by PRC Pictures, The Gang's All Here remains one of Jack Buchanan's best-loved vehicles.http://www.allmovie.com/work/the-gangs-all-here-83599
