Jaishankar who plays the part of college professor was being accused by three girls, Srividya, Vijayalalitha and Jayakumari out of which two are his students and a third who is his landlord's daughter, for different reasons but with the same note that he has sexually harassed them, just before his marriage. His fiancee played by Lakshmi sets out to investigate along with some of his dutiful students. What went wrong, a rare intelligent black and white suspense movie, holding as tight right to the end with great cinematography and enthralling dialogues. This is definitely one of K.Balachander's master pieces.http://www.jointscene.com/movies/Kollywood/Nootrukku_Nooru_-_1971/5874
