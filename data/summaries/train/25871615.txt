A grandmother mouse is telling her granddaughter a bedtime story, and so tells of Little Red Riding Hood , and her visit to Grandma's House, unaware that the wolf  is watching her. He takes a shortcut to Grandma's, only to find four others already there, who he forces out. Red comes along, and he speaks his cue line,  starting the chase. He pursues Red down the staircase, only to be propelled further than intended by a stick of butter. Sylvester then decides to blow the house up with dynamite, but accidentally sticks it into Hector's mouth, who then sticks it in the cat's mouth until it blows up. Sylvester next disguises himself as Red's fairy godmother, attempting to electrocute Red with a rigged wand. Sylvester's incantation is "ragg mopp" in reference to the 1950 pop song Rag Mop by The Ames Brothers. However, Hector unplugs the power so that it doesn't work. He then plugs it back in just as Sylvester tests it on himself. The mouse then tries to go outside, but is trapped once again. Underneath a cup, Sylvester watches as the mouse prepares something, revealed to be a miniature tank that packs a punch. He then traps the mouse by its hole. The grandmother describes how, to save herself, the mouse threw a stick of dynamite out, doing so to demonstrate. The mouse claims that it must have blown the cat up, to which Sylvester replies, "You're not just whistling dixie, brother!"
