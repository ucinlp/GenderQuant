Rachel Cameron  is a shy 35-year-old spinster schoolteacher living with her widowed mother in an apartment above the funeral home once owned by her father in a small town in Connecticut. School is out for summer vacation and Rachel figures it will just be another lonely and boring summer for her.  Fellow unmarried teacher and best friend Calla Mackie, a closeted lesbian, persuades her to attend a revival meeting, where one of the preachers encourages Rachel to express her feelings. Calla also is inspired to explore her emotions, but when she reveals her physical attraction to Rachel, she is kindly rebuffed by her friend. When Rachel's former high school classmate Nick Kazlik comes to town to visit his parents, she succumbs to his charms and has her first sexual experience. Mistaking lust for love, she begins to plan a future with Nick, who rejects her once he realizes she views their relationship as more than a casual and temporary affair. Believing she is pregnant, Rachel plans to leave town and raise the child. With Calla's assistance, she finds another teaching job in Oregon, but before she moves she discovers her expanding girth actually is the result of a benign cyst. After undergoing surgery to have it removed, she decides to relocate as planned and, with her mother in tow, sets out for what she hopes will be a more promising future.
