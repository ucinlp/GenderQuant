The film chronicled the life of Amy Johnson, the British pilot who had gained world attention in the 1930s for her exploits, and who had joined the Air Transport Auxiliary at the outbreak of the Second World War. It was intended to be both a film honouring Johnson, who had died in 1941, and a propaganda call to arms at the height of the war years.
