At the beginning of the 19th century, a man called Gharsallah dies and is buried in a mausoleum in the village of Dhibet, in the center of Tunisia. The film tries to evoke how this Gharsallah affected other lives: Was he Saint? A madman? Possessed? Unjust? The story of a man that marked everything around him, even dreams.
