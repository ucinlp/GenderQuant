John Walton, a district attorney, is presented with an obscenity case: A medical practitioner has been arrested for distributing 'indecent' birth control literature. On the stand, he makes a case for his thesis that breeding and financial planning are integral to raising healthy and happy families, and that sex education and contraception information should be available to prospective parents. Meanwhile, Walton's wife has been keeping a secret from him for many years: She has been seeing a doctor, one Herman Malfit, who performs abortions so that her busy social life will not be interrupted by the inconvenience of pregnancy. She suggests it as an option for her friend Mrs. William Carlo, who is with child. Mrs Carlo has the abortion. The Waltons receive two new guests in their house almost simultaneously: Mrs. Walton's ne'er-do-well younger brother, and the maid's young daughter. Smitten by the brother's advances, the maid's daughter is seduced and soon finds herself in trouble. She is taken to Dr. Malfit and then abandoned by the boy after the operation goes wrong. Making her way back to the Walton mansion, she collapses and dies from the botched abortion. Following Malfit's arrest and trial, Walton examines the doctor's ledgers and realized that his wife and many of her friends are listed as having received 'personal services.' He returns home, furious, to find them lunching at his home. He banishes his wife's friends, saying 'I should bring you to trial for manslaughter!' and confronts his wife, who is overcome with remorse. As the years pass, the couple must contend with a lonely, childless life, full of longing for the family they might have had.
