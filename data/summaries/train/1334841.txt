The Numata family consists of the father, Kōsuke ; mother, Chikako ; and two sons, Shinichi  and Shigeyuki . Shigeyuki is a junior high school student who will soon be taking a high school entrance examination. Unlike the high school student brother, Shinichi, who lives up to Kōsuke’s expectations, Shigeyuki’s grades are consistently poor. The white-collar workaholic father finds a private tutor, Yoshimoto , for Shigeyuki and imposes all responsibilities for his exam on the tutor. Even though Yoshimoto is a seventh year student of a third-rate university, Shigeyuki’s marks become better and better.
