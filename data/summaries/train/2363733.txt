In this cartoon, Scrooge McDuck tries to teach his grandnephews Huey, Dewey and Louie how to save money. Though Scrooge often bemoaned the  loss of his Money Bin during his comic book adventures, this cartoon addressed the more realistic observation that keeping his wealth out of circulation is financially unsound. Scrooge explains the money inside his Money Bin is only a percentage of his fortune; Disney Comics have followed up on the idea his Money Bin simply contains specific wealth that has special nostalgic or significance to him or simply there's no available space for it in banks .
