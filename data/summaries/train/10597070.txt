Woody arrives at "Tony Figaro's" barber shop in hopes of getting a "victory haircut" . Finding the shop's proprietor out for an Army physical, Woody attempts to cut his own hair and those of other customers. The primary customer is a burly Italian construction worker who asks for "the whole works". Once Woody blow-torches the man's construction helmet off his head, he proceeds to lather his client's face, chin, mouth, and boots while singing Rossini's Largo al factotum. Woody then produces a sharp razor and begins shaving the man. Woody elevates the barber's chair to the ceiling whiles singing an aria, allowing the man to fall to the ground and destroy the chair. Woody then begins liberally swinging the razor at his frightened client, who runs to escape him. A chase throughout the barbershop ensues as Woody doubles the tempo of his singing, until the woodpecker corners the man in the barber's chair and proceeds to give him a shave and haircut at manic speed. The construction worker is dusted off and sent out the door on his way, but the angry client enacts a quick bit of revenge. The man picks Woody up and slings him through a glass window and back inside the shop, where the woodpecker lands and is bopped by shaving mugs falling from a broken shelf. As a last touch, the barber's pole falls on Woody, whose head is seen caught inside the pole.
