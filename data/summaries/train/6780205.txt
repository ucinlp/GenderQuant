Devereaux Burke gets a personal request from former President Andrew Jackson to help keep Texas from entering into annexation with Mexico. The movement is gaining favor because it is mistakenly believed that Texas pioneer Sam Houston supports it. The opposition leader is wealthy rancher Thomas Craden, but when Dev is ambushed by Comanche, it is Craden who comes to his rescue. Martha Ronda, who loves Craden and runs the Austin newspaper, does not know Dev is anti-annexation when she and Craden host a number of senators at their home for dinner. When they won't all agree to vote his way, Craden then refuses them permission to leave. Dev gets a signed letter from Sam Houston of his actual position, but the ink smears when he falls into a river, fleeing from Craden's men. He has difficulty persuading Martha, who publishes an incorrect story about Houston's position, but ultimately he wins her over and saves the day.
