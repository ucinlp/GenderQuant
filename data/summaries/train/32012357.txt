The film is about a group of girls growing up in 1960-61 London, who develop an interest in football and support for Tottenham Hotspur, which became the first English team in the 20th century to win both the English league and the FA Cup "double". Twenty years later, one of the girls is making a documentary on the sporting achievement and tracks down players from the 1960-1961 team.
