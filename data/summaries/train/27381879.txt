The overall concept of the series, was that each week The Stooges would try a different job or trade to see if eventually they might succeed. The comedy would ensue as each career they tried would eventually turn into a fiasco, In the pilot they try their hand as interior decorators. In their office, they meet a new client, Mr. Pennyfeather . Just a few moments after Pennyfeather arrives, Shemp accidentally spills ink down the front of Pennyfeather's suit, who becomes enraged. The Stooges then challenge Pennyfeather to mischief with them, featuring the famous "Texas" routine. After the some slapstick mayhem, they are successful in tossing Mr. Pennyfeather out of the office. Suddenly, the next client calls him on the phone for them to come in to manage her house. In her house, The Stooges not only hang wallpaper, but also manage to trash their client's home. Unfortunately, that woman is Mrs. Pennyfeather  and that house is Mr. Pennyfeather's house. After Mr. Pennyfeather comes home, the Stooges cover Mr. Pennyfeather with wallpaper and both Mr. Pennyfeather and the Stooges recognize each other . In a rage, both Pennyfeathers attack the boys with their own paint and utensils. In the end, Moe, Larry, and Shemp, defeated, hang up their brushes.
