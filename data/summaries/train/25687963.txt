Manab , Nayan , Tapan  and Akan  are four unemployed educated youths from lower-middle-class families of Tinsukia. When his father dies, Nayan leaves home to work with an uncle in a distant township. They hatch a plan for easy money and accordingly kidnap a businessman. But being amateurs, they end up killing the hostage. This create a huge furore but no one suspects the three youths because of their otherwise clean record and family background. The insurgent groups, however, deny their any involvement in the incident. With the passage of time the incidents is forgotten but the repentant trio, though, cannot escape pangs of conscience. One day, Manab’s father chances upon Manab’s share of the ransom money and learns about his son’s involvement in the kidnap-death. This shocks him to such an extent that he disowns his only son and forbids him to even light his pyre. Once again their conscience is stricken. They know they can never forgive themselves. In the meantime Nayan, a well off, arrives from Guwahati and tell them not to indulge in any illegal activities. Nayan, with all his conviction and sincerity, becomes an Assam Civil Service officer and is serving as the Sub-Divisional Officer in Tinsukia. He starts a business but it goes down and he loses his mental balance.
