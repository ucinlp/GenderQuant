The D'Souza and the Chaddha families are neighbors and have been good friends for as long as they can remember, and despite their diverse religion and cultural beliefs, celebrate Diwali and Christmas with cheer and gusto. Then Anjali Chaddha and Steven D'Souza fall in love, and this brings an end to the friendship. Anjali and Steven elope, marry, and re-locate to another place, leaving the two families to live with bitterness the rest of their lives. Twenty seven years later, a young man claiming to be the son of Anjali and Steven comes to visit his paternal and maternal grandparents, and is cold-shouldered by both the families'. He persists and wins over the hearts of his grandparents on both sides, but before he could win over his Jassi mama and Moses chacha, they find out that Raja is not who he claims to be. In actuality, Shilpa Shetty's character is the grand daughter.
