Beaver Greenway, a longtime horse owner with a drinking problem, is upset because one of his mares has been lured away by Thunderhead, the wild stallion that previously belonged to Rob and Nell McLaughlin. He goes to Goose Bar Ranch to complain, but the McLaughlins no longer have any control of the horse. Ken McLaughlin returns home to his parents from a horse-buying trip with Crown Jewel, a trotter. Rob is skeptical about the purchase, more so when Crown Jewel develops altitude sickness here in the Wyoming hills. Ken goes on a date with Greenway's granddaughter Carey. A veterinarian advises Crown Jewel be put down due to its congested lungs, but Beaver Greenway, a former sulky driver, recommends a treatment that works. Thunderhead returns and lifts the mare's spirits. Crown Jewel is taken to Ohio to compete in the Governor's Cup sweepstakes, where a newly sober Beaver has entered his own horse, Sundown. The rivals split the first two races. Carey is concerned that her grandfather will begin drinking again if he should lose the third and deciding race. Sundown wins. But all of the McLaughlins are proud of Crown Jewel's effort, particularly when they learn she is pregnant.
