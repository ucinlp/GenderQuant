Canada is being bombed mercilessly by a mysterious plane, which is shaped like a boomerang, and is dubbed "The Falcon". The plane is under the command of Japanese admiral Yamata. The identity of the plane remains a mystery until Professor Marshall Brent and his daughter Carol arrive with a new type of airplane detector. The axis forces are planning a Canadian invasion, and feeling that Professor Brent poses a threat to their plan, they kidnap him. RCMP Sergeant Dave King attempts a rescue, but the Professor is killed when the plane in which he is held captive crashes into a riverboat. Carol, determined to carry on her father's work, manages with Sergeant King's help to prevent the axis spies from capturing the device her father invented. When the spy ring makes a last desperate attempt to capture the device from the cabin in which she is hiding out, she destroys it rather than let it fall into enemy hands. She is kidnapped and taken to a volcano crater where the spy ring has its headquarters. It is up to Sergeant King to rescue her.
