Faten Hamama plays Hoda, a poor woman who leaves an orphanage to live with three young men  in a room on a building rooftop. The three of these men fall in love with her, but she prefers Ahmed, who is played by Omar Sharif, and the others accept that and stay loyal to their friendship. When, one day, Hoda gets sick, the three men urgently work hard to gather enough money to pay for her surgery. The film is not conclusive about what happens to Hoda, but she is supposed to live with her sickness for the rest of her life and can hardly work or get married. What the film shows is the love and fraternity that is created in her friends through her sickness.
