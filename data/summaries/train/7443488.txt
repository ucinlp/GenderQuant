Triads, Yardies and Onion Bhajees is primarily an action movie but it has a mythological and spiritual vein running through it. The character of Chacha worships the Hindu Goddess Kali, and a statue of Kali is shown both in his home and in his office. Chacha is seen praying to the Goddess in a temple. Chachas influence and teachings have also influenced members of his gang. The image of Kali can be seen in the homes of his various gang members. The smoke emanating from the incense surrounding the Kali statue in the temple is deemed to be holy, and Chacha names his crime syndicate "The Holy Smokes". The film suggests that the Goddess Kali is watching the proceedings unfold before her and ultimately will decide who lives and who dies.
