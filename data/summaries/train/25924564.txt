The story is set in the colonial period in Assam. The film deals with a young woman who has to give up her university education for her arranged marriage with a rich tea-planter. The plantation and its social routine become a prison of boredom for her since her husband completely neglects her for his business. Things get worse when she discovers, outraged, that her marriage was for the sake of wiping off a huge debt owed by her father. She considers herself as having been sold to her husband. Then one day an old classmate, now an army officer, visits them. Depressed, she gets drawn to her ex-lover from whom she seeks fulfillment.
