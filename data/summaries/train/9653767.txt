The film follows Caveh Zahedi on a road trip to Las Vegas with his father and half-brother in an attempt to prove the existence of God. He posits that if God exists, and if God is indeed omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent, then all the filmmaker has to do is roll the camera and let God direct the movie. In an attempt "to force God's hand" and change the direction of the film, Zahedi tries persuade his father and half-brother to take Ecstasy with him. When they refuse, things quickly start to unravel.
