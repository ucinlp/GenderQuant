Harry Lambert is a New England lumber company executive whose life has grown stale since his defeat in an election for town mayor. His daughter Kate is of little or no help to anybody, his son-in-law Charlie is a freeloader and his wife Edith is getting up there in years. But what Harry doesn't know is that Edith, bothered by unexplained fatigue, is persuaded by her friend Grace to go see a doctor. To her shock, Edith learns she is pregnant. Harry doesn't want to be a dad again at his age. He also complains about Edith's spending, particularly after he and Charlie insult the mayor and subsequently lose a contract to supply the lumber for a new stadium. Despite his many complaints, Harry is genuinely taken aback when Edith announces that she is leaving him to move to Boston and have the baby by herself. Harry pursues her to bring Edith back, while Charlie finally comes through for him by winning back the stadium contract.
