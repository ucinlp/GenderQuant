Leonard Helperman is a 4th grader whose mother and teacher, Mary Lou, has been nominated for a teaching award. They plan a trip to Florida for the finals, but need to leave their dog, Spot, behind. What Mrs. Helperman doesn't know is that Spot has been masquerading as a boy, Scott, who is her star pupil. Spot wants nothing more than to be a real boy, and sees a way to this when mad scientist Ivan Krank appears on The Barry Anger Show. Krank thinks he can turn animals into humans. Conveniently, his lab is right down the street from where the Helpermans are staying, so Spot, as Scott , convinces Mary Lou to take him along. Spot becomes a man, but discovers it's not everything he ever dreamed of after all.
