The Thomsons are a working class family living in Toronto during the Great Depression. Parents, Thomas Thomson  and Francie Thomson  struggle to provide for their children, Willa , Arthur , Beatrice   and Jakey . 11-year-old Beatrice 'Booky' Thomson is showing her strength in reading and spelling, and has been asked to tutor Georgie Dunlop , an older sixth grader. This thrills Booky, as she has a crush on Georgie and hopes he will ask her to a school dance. But after Georgie gives her a strange gift, she begins to re-evaluate her feelings toward him. Booky's older sister Willa Thomson, has a part time job as a librarian. While at work, Willa meets and is attracted to Russell , a medical student. With her senior year in high school beginning, and even though she knows her family cannot afford it, Willa gives thought toward attending medical school after she graduates. Arthur has an artistic aptitude, and though his parents are supportive of his dreams, his father encourages him to consider a more stable profession, which places a strain on their father-son relationship. Booky goes to the dance with Georgie. He turns up late and surprises her. He kisses her and that's all she talks about.
