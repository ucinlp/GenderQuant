Nancy  and Jeff Troy  move into an somber-looking basement apartment building on 13 Gay Street, Greenwich Village, where the residents all act very strangely. Nancy recognizes one of the residents, Anne Carstairs, who acts very odd and not at all the way Nancy remembers her. At dinner, Nancy overhears a man, later identified as Louis Kaufman, talking on the telephone asking someone to meet him in the basement apartment. Louis goes to the basement apartment and is later found dead in the backyard, after having been drowned in the apartment's bathtub. Jeff recognizes the basement apartment as a former speakeasy and that the "monster" the housekeeper was afraid of turns out to be a turtle called "Old Hickory". Jeff and Nancy figure out that all the residents were being blackmailed by a man named Andrew Bruhl, who used to be a private investigator. Bruhl made all the people being blackmailed live in one building to keep an eye on them. Jeff and Nancy figure out that Bruhl killed Kaufman, and that Bruhl is someone who lives in the building. The suspects are: Anne Carstairs; her husband, Scott Carstairs; Eddie Turner, the landlord; Polly Franklin, who works at a local restaurant; Lingle, another resident; and the housekeeper, Mrs. Salter.
