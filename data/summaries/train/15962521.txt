The film is about a doctor ([[Vishnuvardhan  who is desperately seeking an assistant doctor. Soon he meets a girl  who is also a doctor. Arati likes him at the very first instant but is disappointed to know that he is looking for a female doctor as an assistant first, instead of a wife. Falling to family pressures she marries him, but they are not able to consummate the marriage due to these differences. Vishnuvardhan appoints another lady, Vasanti, as his assistant; this irks his wife even more. Vasanti is a vamp who has set her eyes on the doctor. This causes further disturbances between husband and wife. Finally, the differences are resolved and "alls well that ends well". The portrayal of the characters by Vishnu and Arathi was considered excellent. The film is based on a novel by a Kanada writer, Usha Navaratnaram. Usha's novels have mainly focussed on the problems faced by the working women in the male dominated world. Usha being herself a doctor has written two such novels with a female doctor as the center character-Hombisilu and Bandhana, which were made into films later. Vishnu featured in the male lead role in both these films. Despite these films centering around the female character more , it was actually Vishnuvardhan, who stole the limelight in these films. Vishnu typifies the dynamite persona he established in his first film Nagara Haavu. In Hombisilu he displays this dynamism in a controlled way, that and his shades of sentiment greatly impressed the intelligent Kannada audience and brought him two state awards, one for Hombisilu and later for Bandhana. In both the films he was well matched by two females, Arathi and Suhasini considered his equal in the craft.
