This movie is based on the TV serial Khichdi. It features the antics of the Parekh family. Hansa's brother Himanshu has a ridiculous ambition, that is, to have a memorable and legendary love story of his own. It is altogether another matter that he is not in love with anyone, neither is he capable of getting any sensible girl smitten with him. But, as Babuji wisely says, for every idiotic Praful there is an even more idiotic Hansa in the world; his prophecy turns out to be true. Parminder, Himanshu's neighbor, falls in love with him for no good reason, and the two get engaged to each other. Himanshu realizes, on the eve of the wedding, that the impending ceremony will spell doom for his desire to have a legendary love story: nothing interesting happened in his love life to make it memorable. And so, the exceptionally dumb Parekh family sets out to stall the wedding. They try to create all those missing stages in Himanshu's love story in order to make it legendary. However, in this hilariously hare-brained process, they make a mess of everything. At the incredibly ridiculous climax, Himanshu eventually manages to win his love back.{{cite web}}
