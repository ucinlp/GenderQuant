It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown takes the form of a musical, presenting a series of different songs. The program does not have a strong unifying plot. The program begins with Snoopy defeating Peppermint Patty at football, followed by an opening credits sequence in which the dog takes out a boom box and dances to the title song as the opening credits roll. The next segment shows Peppermint Patty and Marcie at school, followed by a gym class, in which Peppermint Patty leads the other characters in a work out while she sings "I'm in Shape". The part of the song where she sings "Hey Linus...!" is clearly inspired by Toni Bastl's 1981 hit song "Mickey". The scene changes to a party at the home of Sally and Charlie Brown. The children begin playing a game of "Simon Says" before Lucy takes over the game and sings "Lucy Says". Later, the children dance to a song about "Pig-Pen", "The Pig-Pen Hoedown". The song "Flashbeagle" is repeated two more times. Snoopy is seen accompanying Franklin to a night club and dancing to the tune there. Later, Snoopy is taken to school by Sally Brown for Show and Tell, he begins dancing to the song "Flashbeagle", played on a boom box, and all the children gradually join in. The special ends with Charlie Brown saying to his sister that he thinks he should do something about his dog's behavior. Sally disagrees with him because, thanks to Snoopy, she got an "A" for Show and Tell.
