The scarecrow is willing to kill anyone who gets in the way of turning Mary into a scarecrow too so that they can be together forever. Finally, a friend of Dave's from the academy named Karl ([[David Castro  inadvertently becomes a scarecrow, and fight the Dave scarecrow. The Dave scarecrow wins the fight, but then Mary blows him to pieces with a rocket-launcher.
