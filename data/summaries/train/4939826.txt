Zona Zamfirova is set in the southern Serbian city of Niš in the 19th century. The plot follows the story of Zona Zamfirova , a local rich man's daughter, and the vicissitudes of her affair with Mane , an ordinary goldsmith. As it was undesirable for the daughter of a rich man to marry a craftsman, the two are at first divided, with the possibility of Zona marrying Manulać, who came from a wealthy family. Everything is, however, changed as Mane organizes a successful conspiracy to keep Zona for himself.
