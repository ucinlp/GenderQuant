The film is about Beijing-based author and scuba instructor Steven Schwankert's search for the British submarine HMS Poseidon. Schwankert was looking for interesting wrecks to dive in northern China when he found HMS Poseidon on a list of unexplored dive sites. He spent the next six years working on the project, bringing together research in China and the UK to piece together the history of the submarine. HMS Poseidon collided with a cargo ship off the coast of China on June 9th, 1931. Thirty-one of the submarine's crew managed to scramble into the water before the submarine sank to the seabed 130 ft  below. But 25 were trapped inside. The submarine hit the headlines within hours because five men managed to escape from the submarine using the new David Submerged Escape Apparatus. They were the first people to escape from a downed submarine using pro to-scuba devices. The film charts Schwankert's efforts to examine the escape and the accident in unprecedented depth. It also follows him as he uncovers the secret salvaging of the submarine in 1972 by one of China's new salvage teams.
