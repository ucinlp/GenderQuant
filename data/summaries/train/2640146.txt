An itinerant rural worker named Macauley &mdash;sometimes described as a “swagman” or “swaggie”&mdash;suddenly finds himself taking responsibility for his child. Having returned from “walkabout”, he finds his wife entwined in the arms of another, and so he takes the daughter, Buster, with him. The child is the “shiralee”, an Irish or Aboriginal word meaning "swag", or metaphorically, a “burden.”http://hdl.handle.net/2328/311 In their time together, father and daughter explore new depths of understanding and bonding. The barren landscapes of the outback provided both a backdrop to the richness of the relationship, as well as explaining the swagman’s love for the country. Jim and Buster stay with the Parkers, whose daughter Liz was an old lover of Jim's and fell pregnant to him. Jim tries to abandon Buster but she refuses to leave. Buster is injured in a car accident, and father and daughter are reunited.
