Magazine reporter Jonathan Fisher , in danger of losing his job, promises to write a hard-hitting story on prostitution. When no one on the street will talk to him, he fabricates a story of a pimp that's so well-received it puts his career back on track. But police think the story is of a real life pimp who is wanted for murder and start pressuring him to reveal the identity of the subject of his story. Fast Black , the pimp and police suspect, also thinks the story is about himself, and wants to know what Jonathan knows, and who told him. From there a battle of wits and wills ensues between Jonathan and Fast Black, in addition to Jonathan becoming involved with one of the pimp's call girls .
