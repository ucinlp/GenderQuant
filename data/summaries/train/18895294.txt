Though Rajeswari behaves that she is not interested in him, she really loves him. Bullabbayi has a property dispute with his stepbrother Veerababu . In a bid to save a girl called Chintamani  from being sold by a brothel owner  to Veerababu, Bullabbayi pays her money and takes Chintamani with him and keeps her in his outhouse.

Being an honest boy, Bullabbayi reveals everything to his father-in-law and urges him to stop the marriage, but the latter refuses to do so.
