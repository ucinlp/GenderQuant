Loosely based on American politician Ogden L. Mills, Ogden G. Mills awakens on a park bench in Brooklyn. Confused as to why he is there, and noticing numerous differences in his town from how he last remembers it, he attempts to return to something familiar. The court house where he worked has been abandoned, and when Ogden arrives at it he breaks into despair. This leads him to return to a childhood pier and ponder what has happened and where he is going.  The synopsis from the Royal Flush Film Festival states "...[Ogden] falls deeper and deeper into confusion." This can reference the idea that Ogden appears to either be a displaced time traveler with amnesia or a man who has simply lost his mind or both.
