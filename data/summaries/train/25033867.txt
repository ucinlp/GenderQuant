Ku A-ming is a 4th grader boy in Chungshan Elementary School in Shuiyu Township. Despite being not very good in most subjects at school he is very talented in art, and has a great imagination, though most teachers don't know what he's expressing in his artwork. During morning assembly, a new art teacher named Mr. Kuo asks if anyone is interested at joining the ECA art club. Ku A-ming is the first one to volunteer. During an art competition, the school teachers vote to decide who's going to represent the school to compete with other schools in the county. A-ming lost the vote and Mr. Kuo needs to leave the school. Before he leaves, he asks A-ming to give him one of his drawings. Sadly, after Mr. Kuo has left, A-ming dies of liver illness. Mr. Kuo sends A-ming's drawing to a world children art competition and A-ming's drawing is the champion. The teachers start to regret neglecting A-ming's ability in art.
