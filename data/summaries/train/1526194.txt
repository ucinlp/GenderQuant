The introductory storyline involves hitmen Lee Woods and Dosmo Pizzo. The two kill Roy Foxx while he lies in bed after they inject Roy's ex-wife, Becky, with a tranquilizer. The day afterward, Woods turns on Pizzo, shooting him and blowing up their car in order to set him up as the fall guy. Woods flees the scene with his Norwegian girlfriend Helga. Dosmo survives, seeking shelter at the house of Allan Hopper, an abrasive art dealer who suffers from kidney stones. He takes Hopper and his much abused assistant, Susan Parish, hostage. He is completely unaware of the fact that Hopper has called his older sister, Audrey, over to the house for medical help. On the way over to her brother's house, Audrey, a nurse, picks up Teddy Peppers, a down and out TV producer contemplating suicide. Meanwhile, Becky awakens in horror when she discovers Roy's body in bed beside her. She runs from her house and flags down two vice detectives who happen to be driving through. Although he initially feels sympathetic, Wes Taylor begins to feel suspicious, wondering if Becky knows more than she is telling. Later it is revealed that Becky hired Woods and Dosmo to kill Roy for $30,000. Becky, who was unaware that Woods planned to kill Roy in her own house, stashed the payment in her house. The divergent paths of the characters cross, with deadly consequences, after Woods decides to go back to the house to get the money.
