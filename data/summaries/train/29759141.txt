Narrated by Explorer Lowell Thomas, Dr Paul Withington of Harvard University and archaeologist Clinton Childs conducted an anthropological expedition to Australia. Sailing from the west coast of America, the expedition filmed peoples and customs of the islands along the way, eventually landing in Sydney and travelling by train to Ooldea, South Australia where they film Aboriginals living in the desert. They then travel by train to Broome and visit the Aboriginal settlement of Boolah Boolah. They then sail to the Timor Sea and explore the primitive outback of Australia where they meet Aborigines "who have not lost their cannibal instincts." Hearing rumors of a white woman living with an Aboriginal tribe, the expedition eventually makes it's way to a very remote area where they find a white women who is the sole survivor of a shipwreck. The woman is married to a tribal Aborigine and is mother to his blond haired child. She refuses to return to civilisation with them.
