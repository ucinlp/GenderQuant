Harry Canterville, who's spent most of his life in America, returns with his new wife and his daughter from a previous marriage, Jennifer, to take up his inheritance of Canterville Castle. They find that it is haunted by the spirit of a disgraced ancestor, Sir Simon de Canterville, doomed to remain on the estate after the death of his wife, who cursed him for the death of their daughter, which he caused by failing to maintain a bridge. Despite the eccentric relatives who will not enter the castle and the gloomy predictions of Mr. and Mrs. Umney, Harry is determined to stay for at least three months, after which he can take full possession. He also decides to then sell the castle to a property developer. His daughter meanwhile befriends the ghost. She learns that Sir Simon can escape when she persuades the Angel of Death to release him. Despite the risks, she does so and Sir Simon is released from the curse.
