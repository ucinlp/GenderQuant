When Chris Carlyle  moves with his parents from the farm to the city, he secretly takes with him his woodland friend, a full-grown mountain lion. The problems surface when the mountain lion strolls around his new neighborhood, his friendliness mistaken for predatory habits. The neighbors get into an uproar and Chris is forced to allow his friend to be relocated to the city zoo. When Chris visits the zoo to see his feline friend, he is horrified to discover that not only the mountain lion, but all the animals are confined in cramped cages, unhappy and unhealthy. Stirred by the plight of the animals, Chris "borrows" the keys from the zoo-keeper and sets every animal in the zoo free. Taking advantage of their newfound freedom, the animals wander happily about the city, providing a series of amusing situations and panicked townspeople.
