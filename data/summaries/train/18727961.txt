Captain Edward Reynolds brags about his victory over the dreaded pirate Victor Stagnetti to his loyal companion Jules; he has even assembled a new crew for his ship, including Ai Chow and Olivia, Serena's cousin. It is Olivia who informs the crew that the governor of Jamaica has ordered Serena's arrest and Olivia is on board to protect the crew from enemies, and to convince Edward and Jules to ask for Serena's pardon. When they finally go to Jamaica and ask Governor Littleton to pardon Serena, he is more interested in Jules' appearance than anything else. They convince the governor, who first sends them on a mission to kill another group of pirates and find another hidden treasure. Olivia and Jules get off to a rocky start to their friendship, but eventually end up in a steamy lesbian experience. Later, Edward comes across Takvor, the Armenian gold pirate, during a female slave auction and is invited to participate in an orgy featuring belly dancers and slave girls. Meanwhile, Jules is captured by the Chinese pirate empress Xifeng and is administered a liquid which gives her control over Jules' body and mind. Xifeng uses Jules to seduce/capture Edward. He is then forced to fight a dragon-like creature, but Olivia saves him at the last minute. Meanwhile, Victor Stagnetti is reborn from the sea. He and Xifeng engage in a three-way with their new thrall, Jules, as she happily obliges. Edward and Olivia fight off a host of undead skeletons Stagnetti summons and more. Olivia boards the enemy ship and fights Xifeng in a sword fight and takes her down. She then must fight the poisoned Jules as well, until Stagnetti intervenes and takes both of them down. Once again, Edward comes to the rescue, reclaiming his title as "the greatest pirate hunter that has ever lived".
