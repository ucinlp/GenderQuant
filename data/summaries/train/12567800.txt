The widowed Chief Minister Jagdish Acharya lives an opulent lifestyle along with his daughter, Sunita and son, Sanjay. One day he gets a phone call from the Police Commissioner informing him that a woman has filed a F.I.R.  of rape against Sanjay. A shocked Jagdish instructs the Police Commissioner to proceed according to law. Soon after, while touring, Jagdish has a heart attack and dies. Sunita is asked to be the new Chief Minister and accepts. After the funeral the Police arrest Sanjay, hold him in a cell, and try him in court. Sunita's boyfriend, advocate Jaggan Sinha, whose brother, Raghu, is also a lawyer, represents Sanjay. Jaggan examines the evidence, witnesses and the complainant. He proves that the complaint was politically motivated by a journalist named Vidyarthi, and that Parvati did not exhibit signs of rape nor was there any proof of her involvement with Sanjay. The Judge concurs, and Sanjay is set free. While the Archarya family celebrates Sanjay's release, Jaggan finds out that Sanjay did indeed abduct and rape Parvati. Jaggan decides to reopen the case, much to the chagrin of Sunita and her brother; she decides to represent Sanjay against Jaggan. Jaggan takes care of Parvati. Sunita demands that Jaggan not defend Parvati. Jaggan insists. Parvati eventually gets justice, while Jaggan and Sunita reconcile.
