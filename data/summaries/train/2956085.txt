The Boys tell their wives they have a business engagement, then sneak off to a poker game. En route, they stop to help two young ladies with a flat tire, and wind up splattered with mud. The girls invite them up to their apartment while their clothes dry, and all proceed to get roaring drunk. A boyfriend appears, sending the duo scrambling out the back window, in full view of their wives.
