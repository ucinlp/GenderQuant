In 1966, a U.S. military station, the United States Decoding Service,  NASA Wing, in Dallas, has intercepted a message, and after decoding, the message contains only the cryptic statement, "Mars Needs Women". Apparently, Martians have a genetic deficiency that produces only male babies. A mission to Earth is launched, consisting of five Martians, led by Dop . The team intends to recruit women to come to Mars, and select five prospective candidates. Using their sophisticated transponder, the leader attempts to make contact with the military who have tracked their arrival on Earth. When the U.S. military see the Martians as invaders, the team takes on the guise of Earthlings, and acquire human clothes, money, maps and transportation. They set their sights on a number of women including a stewardess, stripper and, especially, a Pulitzer Prize winning scientist, Dr. Bolen , an expert in space genetics. Resorting to hypnosis, the women are captured. Dop becomes enamored with Dr. Bolen, and is ready to sabotage the mission. After the military forces discover their hideout, the Martians are eventually forced to go back to Mars without their captives.
