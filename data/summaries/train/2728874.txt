Francis Bergeade, owner of a toilet seats and brushes' factory in Dole, has just turned 65 and his life is a misery. Tax services are harassing him, his snobby wife Nicole despises him, and his daughter whimsically wants to have an expensive wedding. Francis knows only moments of relief while having lunches or dinners in fancy restaurants with his best friend, car dealer Gérard. Stress become too overwhelming and while on a lunch, he suffers a fainting spell. During his convalescence, his family watch a reality TV show about long-lost relationships and disappearances called "Où es-tu?" . Amongst all cases, a Spanish-born woman, Dolorès Thivart, and her daughters, "Zig" and "Puce", producers of duck foie gras from Condom, are looking for their husband and father, Michel, who vanished 27 years ago. The thing is Michel Thivart happens to be Francis's exact look-a-like. For Francis, it means more problems to come. Or is it the start of a brand new life?
