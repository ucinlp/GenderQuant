One day when he arrests the criminal mastermind Tony Briganza , he is shocked when Tony is released from police custody because his corrupt lawyer shows the court a videotape showing him at a completely different place so therefore he couldn't have committed the crime. From this day on they become enemies and Vijay is hot on Tony's trail every time he commits a crime. One day while watching a film called Seeta Aur Geeta, he realises that two people can be at different places at the same time if they are twins. He realises that Tony has a twin brother called Jojo who covers for him each time he commits a crime so he can get away with it easily. He successfully gets Tony arrested and put in prison. However Tony escapes and hides out at the house of Shekhar and Seema. When Shekhar realises that Tony and Jojo are wanted criminals, he tries to contact Vijay. But Tony and Jojo find out and kill Shekhar and Seema. Vijay is devastated by the loss of his two best friends and is comforted by nightclub dancer Sapna  whom he falls in love with.
