One night, Bob and Bobbie  leave their trailer to go skinny-dipping, leaving Mr. Weenie  to guard the cinnamon buns they left on the counter. Boog  and Elliot  sneak into the camp and discover there's buns in trailer. Unfortunately, Weenie is guarding the door. To avoid waking Weenie, Boog and Elliot climb onto the roof and Boog ties Elliot to the end of a rope and lowers him through the open skylight. Unfortunately, Elliot is distracted by the buns and salivates, waking Mr. Weenie, who bites his backside, accidentally pulling Boog into the trailer. Bob and Bobbie hear noises from outside and think that Weenie is being attacked. Bobbie puts on a towel to go investigate. Shocked by what she sees, she accidentally drops her towel, revealing her bare tattooed buttocks  to a passing police car, whose driver pulls over, startled by the naked woman. Elliot runs out of the window looking for a place to hide, leaving Boog incriminatingly holding Weenie by the tail when the police officer, Gordy , breaks into the camper. Mr. Weenie says to Boog, "You are so busted," and Boog responds, "Tell me about it."
