The king is thrilled at the birth of Yuvraj, the heir to the throne while Hariya is cynical about the birth of his son, Raja. Both the children grow up looking identical, but there is a constant contrast in their lives and upbringing. One day, Raja runs away from home and somehow ends up in the palace, where he meets Yuvraj. Both the boys discover how different their lives are. Being tempted to see the world outside, Yuvraj changes identities with Raja and leaves the palace. Both boys now struggle in vain to adjust to their new identity.
