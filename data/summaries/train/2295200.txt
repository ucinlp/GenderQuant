In 1876 Dawson wants to prevent a train from getting to Tomahawk, Colorado on time, so to keep it from competing with his stage coach line. Kit Dodge Jr. , who must get the train to its goal, forces Johnny Behind-the-Deuces  aboard as the needed passenger. Madame Adelaide's  showgirls  ride along and, in route to Tomahawk, join Johnny in "Oh, What a Forward Young Man You Are."
