Krazy Kat and his pal Ducky are on vacation as they board a train at the station. But their pleasant ride is going to have some disruptions when their rival Blackrat also goes on board. Moments after the train departed, Krazy and Ducky were confronted by Blackrat. The cat and the rodent engage in a brawl while the mallard stands aside, serving as Krazy's back up. Krazy eventually wins the fight and kicks Blackrat off the train. Though removed from the ride, Blackrat still looks to get back at them as the rodent tampers a track switch, sending the train into another track. Krazy and Ducky are still on the train, enjoying their tour. Although the train is running on a different track, they give it no thought, assuming they're on the right path. But things begin to look grim for them when they see another train coming right at theirs. Without enough time to come up with a good solution, Krazy takes out a huge spring and heads to the front of their train. Miraculously, the crash was prevented as the trains were cushioned by the spring. The mayor and the crowd, who are present at the scene, were amazed by the deed as they applauded and give handshakes to Krazy.
