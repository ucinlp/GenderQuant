While on a cruise, stodgy, overly-frugal businessman Larry Wilson  gets hit on the head with an oar while rescuing 'Doc' Ryan . He wakes up and remembers that he is actually a suave conman named George Cary; Doc is one of his crooked associates. However, he has lost all memory of the past nine years as Larry. He returns to New York and learns that he is married to Kay , who is in the process of divorcing him to marry Herbert . George talks Doc into masquerading as a physician treating him, partly out of curiosity, but mostly because of greed, after seeing the balance in his checking account. That turns out to be a dead end (the money is only held in trust for the [[Community Chest , so he decides to swindle people using his alter-ego's sterling reputation. A complication arises when he falls in love with Kay a second time. She however wants nothing further to do with her boring cheapskate of a husband. George attempts to win back Kay's affections while simultaneously trying to sell some worthless land to the greedy leading citizens of the town.
