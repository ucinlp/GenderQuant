Two lonely Londoners - Neaera Duncan, a children's author , and William Snow, a bookstore assistant  - find common ground when visiting the sea turtles at London Zoo; independently of each other, both perceive that the turtles are unnaturally confined, and they hatch a plan with the assistance of zookeeper George Fairbairn  to smuggle them out and release them into the sea, which they ultimately succeed in accomplishing.
