{{Expand section}} Lewis Tater , a 1930s-era aspiring novelist who harbors dreams of becoming the next Zane Grey, decides to leave his family home in Iowa to go to the University of Titan in Nevada so he can soak up the western atmosphere. He arrives to find that there is no university, only a mail order correspondence course scam run by two crooks out of the local hotel. He tries to spend the night at the hotel, and is attacked by one of the men. He escapes his attacker and steals their car, pulling over when it runs out of gas. He wanders through the desert and happens upon a threadbare film-unit grinding out "B" westerns called Tumbleweed Studios. He catches a lift with the cowboy actors to Los Angeles. After applying at Tumbleweed, he is referred by crusty old extra Howard Pike  to the Rio, a western themed restaurant. While washing dishes at the Rio, he is called by Tumbleweed, where Howard mentors him to be an actor. After proving himself as a stuntman, unit manager Kessler  offers him a speaking role. Tater then falls in love with spunky script girl Miss Trout .http://www.allmovie.com/work/hearts-of-the-west-21928 Meanwhile his pursuers trace him to Los Angeles to retrieve the safe-box containing their money that was in the car stolen by Lewis.
