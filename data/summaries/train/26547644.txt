A terrorist group seizes the British embassy in downtown Los Angeles, killing hostages. All seems lost, but "T-Force," the world's first fully cybernetic law enforcement team is deployed and within minutes, more than thirty terrorists are dead. However, Adam, one of the members of T-Force, goes too far and shoots a disarmed and surrendering female terrorist. He then destroy a terrorist helicopter with six hostages on board with a grenade launcher. The mayor and the Chief of the LAPD decide to shut down the program and disassemble the cybernauts despite protest from the cybernaut's chief scientist. Perceiving their shutdown a threat to their self-preservation, the cyborgs rebel and go on a killing rampage by targeting the mayor and the chief. Lieutenant Jack Floyd of the LAPD teams up with Cain, one of the cybernauts who chose to obey the law, to hunt down the renegade cybernauts and destroy them.
