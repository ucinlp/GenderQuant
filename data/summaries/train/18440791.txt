The film deals with the plight of the protagonist whose name has changed overnight. The problem aggravates when the changed name connotes religious and cultural differences when Shymal  or Salim , the protagonist becomes Salim or Shyamal. The film brings into focus the crisis in his life and the pain of being ostracized and alienated by everyone that matters to him. In such a situation of loneliness, Shyamal identifies with his next-door neighbor who has also been alienated and is fighting his lonely existence. The film portrays excellent photographic work, interesting camera angles mostly associated with directors from Middle-Eastern countries. This film has found a niche fan-following within the urban Bengali crowd and its abstract ending was well-appreciated by the viewers.
