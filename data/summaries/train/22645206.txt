Every morning is a fixed group of people in the local swimming pool. None of the regulars know each other, only by sight. Yet the police here think otherwise, who do a morning raid on a suspect and believe everyone is together in what they constitute a criminal organization. One of the main suspects is Loes, who takes her story to the detective, her story seems to resolve the whole thing but then it is suspected that she is a racist.
