Led by Captain Collyer , a detachment of Royal Navy tax and revenue officers arrive in the village of Dymchurch on Romney Marsh. The area is notorious for liquor-smuggling and they are on the trail of the culprits. They find a village of apparently honest, pious and simple folk, looked after benevolently by their philanthropic vicar Doctor Syn . However Syn is in fact the leader of the smugglers of the parish, using his cover as a man of the cloth to run a profitable ring whose dividends are used to better the lives of the local community. Collyer gradually comes to suspect what is going on, and a series of chases and confrontations takes place across the marshes with Syn and the smugglers always managing narrowly to outwit their pursuers. Collyer finally discovers that Syn is in fact none other than the notorious pirate Captain Clegg, thought to have been executed many years earlier. Still one step ahead, Syn destroys all incriminating evidence and he and his men make their escape.
