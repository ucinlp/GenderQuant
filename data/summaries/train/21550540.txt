Kassie Larson  decides she wants to have a baby. Despite the objections of her neurotic best friend Wally Mars , she chooses to do so alone, with the services of handsome and charming sperm donor Roland ([[Patrick Wilson . Wally has always had feelings for Kassie, but as his friend Leonard  points out, he missed his chance and she put him in the "friend zone." Kassie organizes an "insemination party," where Roland produces the sperm in the bathroom, and leaves behind the cup. Wally uses the bathroom and sees the sample. Drunk, and not liking the idea of Kassie being inseminated with this sperm, he plays with the cup, and accidentally spills it into the sink. Panicking, he replaces the sperm with his own. The insemination is successful but Kassie has to leave New York because of her work; still believing that she is pregnant with Roland's child. Seven years later, Kassie returns to New York along with precocious-but-neurotic son Sebastian ([[Thomas Robinson . Wally forms a bond with this loveable mini-version of himself and Sebastian has started to become close with Wally, but the bad news is that Roland is in the picture too: Kassie has started dating him because she thinks he is Sebastian's father. In the end, Wally reveals to Kassie that Sebastian is his son, along with his true feelings for her. At first she is angry, and does not want to see him again, but Sebastian misses him and so does she; finally she breaks up with Roland. Wally proposes to her, and Kassie accepts. The final scene shows a very happily married Wally and Kassie at Sebastian's birthday party.
