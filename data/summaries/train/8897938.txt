The movie starts off in a forest with a family being attacked by a family of huge Brazilian Cocorada. It then moves to a typical-looking family moving into a well-off suburban Ohio neighborhood. The family are the insects that were seen earlier in the film, after they took on human form and met every "normality" standard from the magazine Family Bazaar. They moved to the suburbs after the husband Dick got a job at a nuclear power plant; he works there to one day cause an explosion that would rid the world of humans and let bugs be. But after a while the family drifts from its normalities &mdash; the son, a straight-laced A student, begins listening to heavy metal and becomes a junkie; the husband and wife drift away from each other, the husband having an affair at work and the wife becoming attached to her credit card; lastly the pretty, smart and nice daughter becomes a pregnant lesbian after being raped by a jock from the high school. They each show their true bug form at least once in the filmâ€”the son does while smoking marijuana with his metalhead buddies, the daughter while being raped by the jock, the husband at the very last battle and the wife. As they drift away from normality  their aunt is sent to help. She becomes a nuisance and they decide she should be taken care of. The husband  decides to not blow up the plant, and kills the aunt instead. At the end of the movie they return to their lives in Brazil, and are visited by the townspeople that grew to love them, although the plant did not blow, enough radiation was released to remove the hair from much of the population of the town.
