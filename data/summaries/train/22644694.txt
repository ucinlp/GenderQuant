Abel is a 31 year old boy who still lives at his parents home. He hasn't been out for over 10 years, much to the chagrin of his father Victor. On the other hand he gets spoiled by his mother Duif. He spends most of his days spying on the neighbours, setting up his parents against each other and fruitlessly trying to cut flies in two with an enormous pair of scissors. His father enlists a psychiatrist who puts the blame on the parents for their difficult relation; summons a mesmerist who gets frustrated by Abel; and tries to set up his son with a girl in his theater society. After mother and son secretly buy a TV-set father Victor gets furious and turns his son into the streets. Abel meets Zus, who works at a peepshow called "De Naakte Meisjes" . She takes pity on him. Zus has a relation with a married man and Abel finds out this person is his own father. In the mean time his mother finds out his whereabouts and a confrontation takes place at Zus' place.
