Raja Saab  is an aged powerful and greedy owner of a coal mine. He treats the miners very poorly. He prefers to eat diamonds, for which he punishes Raja's father and steal diamonds from his father. Raja comes across the beautiful Gauri  and intends to marry her. He sends her a marriage proposal along with a picture of his mute slave Shankar . Gauri falls in love with Shankar's picture and starts dreaming of her life as his bride. On the wedding day, she discovers that she is marrying Raja and faints. Raja takes her to his room and tries to have sex with her but she refuses and Raja locks her away. Gauri attempts to commit suicide but is stopped by Shankar - she is angry with him at this point as she believes he was part of Raja's plan. One night Raja's secretary Bindya  is raped by Raja's brother Brijwa but Shankar rescues her and Brijwa informs Raja that Shankar tried to rape her. Bindya is sold to a brothel. Gauri's brother comes to rescue Gauri but is murdered by Raja - before dying he asks Shankar to run away with his sister. Shankar and Gauri escape to the mountains and Raja and his men go in search of them. When they find them, Raja pushes Shankar off a cliff and sells Gauri to the brothel with Bindya. Shankar survives his fall and is operated on by a doctor who finds Shankar is not mute by birth. Shankar reveals that when he was a child, two men killed his parents in front of him and when he threatened to expose them, someone came behind him and stuffed coal in his throat, thereby depriving him of his voice. Shankar returns to the town to find Gauri. He sees her being sold to two men who he recognises as the men who killed his parents. He runs into Brijwa and murders him. He is then able to kill the two men who have taken Gauri but not before discovering that Raja had in fact sent them to murder his parents. Shankar finds Raja the next day and sets him on fire, killing him. Shankar and Gauri then reconcile.
