Jason has to seduce Sheila , who is in a steady relationship with Michael ([[Tom Parker , and Patrick has to seduce Alison , who is already engaged. After Jason succeeds in his part, Patrick blackmails Alison using photos of her cheating on her fiance and then tells her how he succeeded and then he pulls down her white thong and rapes her to fulfill his part of the bet. Jason and Cassidy strike up a relationship as Patrick is left unsatisfied and angry. He attempts to seduce Cassidy, but she rejects him. So he convinces Cassidy that the man she loves, Jason, is only staying with her because he wants to win the bet with Patrick that they had set, which was to see who could sleep with Cassidy first. Seemingly angry with Jason, she succumbs to Patrick, and Jason walks in on them. Patrick snidely remarks that both Jason and Cassidy have been victims of his cruel game to show them that they underestimated the evil in themselves. They ask him if he has ever been a victim and he tells them no, but Cassidy reveals that this had been her plan all along. She began the little charade so Patrick and Jason would seduce Alison and Sheila; before sleeping with Patrick, she took one of his sleeping pills, planning to tell the policemen that he had drugged and raped her. As Patrick is led away by the police, bewildered and protesting his innocence, he is warned that another victim has come forward, and he will get the punishment he deserves for raping Alison. In the end Jason and Cassidy are shown together and making another bet with each other.
