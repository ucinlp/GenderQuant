For the first two acts, the plot essentially follows the lines of the short story. However, in the third act of the film, the protagonist, Wilmarth, uncovers an attempt by collaborators  to open a gateway between Yuggoth and Earth. He foils the plot with the help of an added character, Hannah, the child of one of the collaborators. His escape, however, is unsuccessful and at the end of the film the audience discovers that Wilmarth has been narrating from a machine attached to the cylinder in which his brain now resides. This differs from the original story in which Wilmarth flees in the middle of the night and safely returns to Arkham. According to Sean Branney on the making-of featurette "The Whisperer Behind the Scenes," Lovecraft was better at set-ups than endings. From a dramatic standpoint, Lovecraft's story brought the writers through what would be "Act Two" of a standard movie structure and felt incomplete. The character of Hannah and opening of gate to Yuggoth were introduced in order to "[make it] a good movie." Branney and Leman intended to make Wilmarth's world "more emotionally complicated" because Hannah's future caused him to be "invested in more than just himself." The characters of Wilmarth's three friends at Miskatonic University were developed from Call of Cthulhu role-playing characters created years before by Branney, Leman, and a friend. Regarding the introduction of a biplane, Leman commented "If you have monsters that fly, you have to have a dogfight with a biplane."The Whisperer in Darkness. Dir. Sean Branney. 2011. DVD.
