Upon being informed that he is fatally ill with cancer, Max, who works at a used car lot, steals over seventy thousand illegally gained euros from his boss. His boss sees him, giving chase to Max. Max intentionally crashes the car. He is pulled unconscious from the destroyed vehicle by a homely young woman, Emma, who lives alone on a farm in the boondocks. She discovers the money and sets the car aflame. When Max comes to, she tells him that the car has burned and that she took nothing but him from the car before it burst into flames. Max hides from her the fact that he is dying. He also hides from the police, in the form of the near-by village's young officer, Henner, who has had his heart set on marrying Emma. Love blooms between Max and Emma, after some stumbles, such as his finding out that she had taken the money.
