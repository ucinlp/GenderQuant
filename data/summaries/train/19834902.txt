The Fisher family moves into the seemingly perfect suburban neighborhood to get away from the city, Bert's drinking problem, and wife Ilene's propensity for males. They meet the neighbors, the Conleys and Elstons, and soon they're having cocktails, cookouts, and hitting on each other's mates, but not without guilt and repercussions. The Fishers fall into a dangerous game of wife swapping with the two other two swinging couples until the unwilling Bert can't take it any more.
