The film starts with a prologue scene set in Bolivia in 1908. Butch Cassidy writes a letter to his family, enclosing a belt buckle engraved with a treasure map. Cassidy and his accomplice, Harry Longabaugh , attempt to elude capture when their hideout is surrounded by Bolivian police. The film then shifts to Circleville, Utah, in 1951, where Butch Cassidy's 16-year old great-nephew, Roy Parker, defends his infamous ancestor's reputation despite the opposition of Sam, his stern grandfather, Cassidy's younger brother. Sam resents Roy's interest in Cassidy, even acquiescing in the boy's brief jailing on a trumped-up charge, where he scolds him, "I spent the better part of my life trying to live down the reputation that your hero has laid out for the Parker name and you grow up worshipping him." Roy also embarks on a personal mission to learn the truth about his infamous ancestor's death.{{cite web}}
