The film tells the story of two Shinsengumi samurai. One of them is Sait≈ç Hajime , a heartless killer and the other is Yoshimura Kanichiro , who appears to be a money-grubbing and emotional swordsman from the northern area known as Nambu Morioka. The main storyline is set during the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate, but it is told in a series of flashbacks as two characters reminisce. The themes include conflicting loyalty to the clan, lord, and family. More than just a story of swordplay, it is the story of a man willing to do anything for the good of his family, even if it means never being able to see them.
