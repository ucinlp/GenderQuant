Donald and his nephews visit a carnival. While they play games, Donald is tricked by a shifty barker into fighting "Pee Wee Pete" , a truculent bruiser who significantly outweighs Donald. In spite of help from Huey, Dewey and Louie, the situation looks desperate for Donald Duck, until his fist accidentally connects with Pete's jaw, which crumbles. It turns out Pegleg Pete literally had a glass jaw. Donald wins the prize money and exits the carnival triumphantly with his nephews.
