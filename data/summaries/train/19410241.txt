Spanky, Alfalfa, Buckwheat, Porky, and Waldo are anxious to get out of school. They overhear the superindendant of the area schools talking with Miss Lawrence who wants to close the school for a week to attend a sister's wedding. She was initially denied stating that only an epidemic would justify closing school. So Spanky decides to stage a phony epidemic. This time, it is the measles, requiring the boys to paint blotches on their faces. The plan comes a-cropper when, while visiting the doctor , the boys are led to believe that Buckwheat has been transformed into a monkey. Until the end of the film, Spanky thinks Buckwheat is still a monkey. That was when he found out that the superintendent changed her mind and decided to let Miss Lawrence to attend the wedding after all and the school would be closed for a week. Then Buckwheat comes out and they all learn that Buckwheat did not become a monkey.<ref namehttp://movies.nytimes.com/movie/225691/Three-Smart-Boys/overview |title2008-09-21|work=NY Times}}
