Claude Eastman  is a composer and the conductor of a prestigious symphony who has recently married beautiful Daniella , a much younger woman. While travelling, he sends a message to his friend Norman Robbins  to keep an eye on his wife, but the message is garbled by Claude's Italian valet Giuseppe , and instead of looking after Daniella, Norman hires a private detective named Keller  to investigate her. The private eye's report, which comes with a fuzzy video, is that Daniella had an assignation with a man who, by wearing Argyle socks, appears to be Maxmillian Stein , a handsome violinist with the orchestra &ndash; and Claude's protégé &ndash; who is well known as a ladies man. Claude at first doesn't directly confront Maxmilliam. When Maxmillian eventaully meets Daniella, it is at a restaurant where Claude, overwhelmed with jealously, duels Maxmilliam with violins by playing Csárdás, the famous composition of Vittorio Monti. Claude confronts Daniella, who feels guilty because she is keeping a secret from her husband, only not the one he thinks it is. When she tells him that it's no big deal, Claude is enraged. As he conducts Tchaikovsky's "Violin Concerto", an elaborate plan to kill Daniella and frame Max for the murder runs through his mind, but afterwards, when he tries to carry out his plan, unforeseen circumstances intervene.rcs0411 Plot summaryBetzold, Michael Plot synopsisCanby, Vincent "Film: Unfaithfully Yours" New York Times
