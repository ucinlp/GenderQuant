Keke  is a young girl with a loving father  and mother, as well as loyal friends. She is diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma , which is unusual at her age. After undergoing twenty-five sessions of chemotherapy, the once healthy and beautiful Keke finds herself sickly and bald, with a disfigured face. Although the treatment initially works, the cancer returns a year later. Doctors estimate that Keke has three months to live. To help her deal with her pain, she begins keeping a diary; through her writing she finds the strength to hold on for a year. As she begins to accept her fate, she writes a letter to God in her diary, asking that her family be kept safe.
