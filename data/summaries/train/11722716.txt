Cristiana  is seen enjoying herself, dancing and drinking with other men. Mario  races down a dark road and calls Cristiana from a payphone with a sense of urgency. When she does not answer, he proceeds to her apartment and angrily pounds on the door and rings the bell. He demands a traditional relationship, and leaves when she refuses but tries to seduce him. Mario transfers to a desert fort in Tripolitania, where a heroic captain has recently perished in combat against the "rebels." Captain Santelia  distrusts Mario at first as a cowardly playboy. However, after the "rebels" steal some animals, the two pursue them with a squadron of camel-riding natives on a long and panoramic desert trek. Mario becomes ill, but eventually the two officers come to a mutual understanding and Mario disposes of a locket from Cristiana and stops reminiscing of their luxurious memories. Having caught up to the "rebels" at an oasis, a battle ensues; the "rebels" are defeated but the captain is killed. Meanwhile, Cristiana and a group of other tourists have arrived at the fort. A reconnaissance plane brings news to the fort of the battle, without knowing which officer has perished. Mario returns and elects to remain in Tripolitania, breaking up with Cristiana.
