Anders seeks advice from his father, but the father is drunk and they end up fighting. The father blames his wife for all the misery they are suffering from, meaning it's all because he was humiliated by affair she once had. The mother blames the father, meaning it was his violent behaviour that caused her infidelity. Anders decides to leave his family, his pregnant girlfriend and all misery behind. He joins Sixten and they both travel to Stockholm.
