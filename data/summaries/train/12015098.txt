Carson portrays Dexter Jackson, a young, black deliveryman in Atlanta, Georgia who aspires to become a news reporter. Jackson gets what he considers his big break, when he drives up to a hostage situation. When the reporter on the scene is killed, Dexter steps in and confronts the hostage-taker, who threatens to kill himself on live television. However, Dexter talks the man out of it, and ratings-obsessed executive producer Kate Penndragin  later offers Dexter a reporter position at "News 4 Atlanta". A recurring gag throughout the film involves Jackson seeing himself on TV with notably different facial features, i.e. thinner lips, straight hair, and a lighter complexion. As Kate tries to transform Dexter's urban image , he begins questioning whether he's starting to sell out as he becomes more and more successful, in other words, he wonders whether becoming successful also means becoming "white". Although Dexter begins to fulfill his dream, he also starts forgetting where he came from. He alienates those close to him with tabloid-style exposé stories, i.e. a local barber's illegal numbers racket, and a restaurant's unhealthy cooking styles. Dexter loses his fiancé Toynelle  after a night on the town results in him spending the night with ditzy weather forecaster, Missy Carnes . Dexter also betrays his best friend Baker Moon  by revealing a local criminal's plan to commit grand theft auto. Baker winds up in the hospital. After longtime anchor Clifford Worthy  blows up on the air, Kate promotes Dexter to lead anchor and teams him with Missy, much to his chagrin. Kate also arranges a live marriage between the two, which she plans to exploit for ratings. However, in the end, Dexter comes to his senses and calls off the wedding, deciding to go back to Toynelle. He also makes amends to those he stepped over, just to become successful. In the end, Dexter finally reaches his goal, becoming co-anchor at News 4 Atlanta, alongside Clifford Worthy.
