In Spain of the 1960s, a poor family of quinquis - a nomadic ethnic group with a tradition as old as that of the gypsises of Spain but with even more obscure origins - have a nomadic life marked by poverty. The son, Eleuterio SÃ¡nchez Rodriguez, nicknamed "El Lute", steals some chickens and is condemned to six months in jail. El Lute moves to the slum outskirts of Madrid with his common law wife, Chelo, starting an itinerant life as a peddler of pots and pans and living in a quinqui shantytown. He gradually embarks upon as life of petty criminality, eventually participating in the theft of a jewelry store during which a bystander is killed. The Guardia Civil catch up with him fast. He is arrested again, but even under torture, he refuses to reveal the identities of his partners in crime. Despite this, they are rounded up and all three are sentenced to death for the murder they committed while robbing the jewelry store. A last minute reprieve by General Franco saves their lives in the last minute, commuting the sentence. Later, while being escorted by two civil guards in a train, El Lute manages to escape, eluding a nationwide manhunt for several weeks despite having a broken arm. The Civil Guards eventually track him down and return him to prison. El Lute, thanks to his daring escapes from police custody and anti-Franco stance, becomes a most uncommon folk hero.
