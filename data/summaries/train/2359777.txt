Yakusho plays Kenichi Takabe, an emotionlly repressed police detective with a mentally unstable wife. Takabe investigates a series of bizarre murders. Though each victim is killed in the same way, with a large "X" carved into their necks, the perpetrator is different each time. In every case the murderers are caught close to the scene of the crime, and although they readily confess to committing the crimes, they never have substantial motive and cannot explain what drove them to kill. Takabe, together with a psychologist named Sakuma, eventually determines that one man is the common thread among the murders, as each person he comes in contact with commits a killng shortly thereafter. The man, called Mamiya, appears to have extreme short-term memory loss; he seems constantly confused about what day it is, where he is, and what his name is. He claims to recall nothing of his past. After Takabe catches Mamiya, he searches the man's apartment and discovers that Mamiya used to be a student of psychology who studied mesmerism and hypnosis. Takabe comes to realize that Mamiya has no memory problems, and that he is instead a master of hypnosis, capable of planting criminal suggestions in strangers' minds by exposing them to repetitive sounds, the motion of water, or the flame of a lighter. Mamiya is jailed and charged with incitement to murder. Mamiya also finds Takabe fascinating, possibly because he cannot force Takabe to kill. Takeba does have visions of his wife dead, however, and the more he researches Mamiya, the more Takeba feels that he might be losing his mind. His wife's strange behavior and concerns about his own mental stability lead him to have her committed to a mental hospital. When Mamiya escapes, killing a policeman and a doctor in the process, Takabe tracks him to a deserted building in the wilderness and shoots him. The film's final scenes suggest that Takabe himself has become the master hypnotist, and that he is carrying on Mamiya's bizarre work.
