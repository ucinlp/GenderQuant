A man, referred to in the movie only as "Man" , wakes up, severely injured, in a wrecked car in the bottom of a ravine. He has a broken leg, and is suffering from amnesia. He hallucinates about a woman finding him. After a few days of being stuck in the position, he manages to escape the car. In the car, he finds several bags of money and a loaded revolver. Hearing on the car radio about an armed robbery by a man named Raymond Plazzy, and finding a credit card in his pocket with Raymond's name on it, he assumes that he is Raymond Plazzy, and that he committed the robbery. A dog appears, and the man follows it into the woods. He eventually finds a working cell phone, but cannot obtain a signal in the woods. Frequently hallucinating about the woman, he finally shoots her with the revolver after realizing the hallucination led him back to the car. He then decides to get out of the ravine. After crawling for days, he finds a road and a dead body with a driver's licence that says Raymond Plazzy. He then pieces together what happened to him: He was running errands with his wife  when he witnessed an armed robbery and was taken hostage by Raymond, and they were driving down the road and arguing about the situation. He used the moment, grabbed the wheel, causing it to crash. The man now has a cell phone signal, and calls for help. The man is picked up by a forest ranger. He waits to get the dog in the truck, but the ranger says that there is no dog there. He enters the truck and looks out as the scene blacks out.
