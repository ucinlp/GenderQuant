The action takes place in France during the Second World War. A young Jewish girl, Sarah, is looking to escape the clutches of the Third Reich after seeing her parents and sister brutally slain by a smuggler who betrayed them while attempting to escape to England. Terrified, she is sheltered by her childhood friend Jean, a homosexual in a clandestine relationship with his lover Philippe. They are safe for the moment, thanks to Jean's plan to pass her off as a Christian employee of his laundromat. However, a bad decision made by Jean's troublesome brother Jacques causes Jean to be wrongly accused of being the lover of a German officer. Jean is then forced into a Nazi labor camp.
