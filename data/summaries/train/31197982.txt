The film is set in two periods — the first in the political milieu of the 1960s when Kerala was brought under the Presidential rule after the dismissal of the first Communist ministry; the second in 1976 during the Emergency, the time of police excesses and political witch-hunting. Due to constant harassment by the local MLA-cum-landlord, Mangamma  and her father  are forced to flee their village on the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border. The landlord's son attempts to rape Mangamma's younger sister but unfortunately they both die in a fire that destroys the hut. Mangamma and her father are offered shelter and a job by Nair , who runs a tea shop with his adopted son Velayudhan. Nair marries Mangamma after her father's death. The later part of the film takes place 16 years later. Mangamma and Nair have a 15-year-old son - Sankaran, who just flirts around with Lucy, a girl who helps Mangamma in her popcorn business. When Velayudhan who has worked with her since childhood disappears one day, the shop is thrown into disarray. Velayudhan  is now a rebel, wanted by the police. A rich contractor wants to buy Nair's land, and his refusal brings about a catastrophe. The police harasses Mangamma and Nair. Nair becomes one of the many faceless, nameless victims of the Emergency — he dies in police custody. The tea shop is burnt. Standing up to these trials, Mangamma survives. In the last shot, Velayudhan sits in the tea shop. He is reading a book. He remains in the frame even as Mangamma leaves.
