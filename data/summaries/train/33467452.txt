Elga Pulsaki  and her brother Ossip  emigrate to the United States from Russia to escape persecution. Elga marries Norman Hutchinson , but their marital bliss is torn asunder when Norman learns that Elga had had sex with a government official in Russia who had threatened her brother. Norman throws Elga out of the house, but Norman's sister reminds him that he did not suggest the same course of action for her when she realized her husband  had previously fathered a child out of wedlock. Struck by cognitive dissonance--the unequal treatment of the sexes--Norman apologizes to Elga and they are reunited.<ref namebsoUXGZSxZcC&pg#vfalse American Film Institute catalog], p. 739 .
