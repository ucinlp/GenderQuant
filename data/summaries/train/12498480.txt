Zhao Zilong begins his career by enlisting in Liu Bei's army. He befriends a fellow soldier Luo Ping'an, who is from the same hometown as him. Not long later, Zhao participates in a battle against Liu Bei's rival Cao Cao. He follows Zhuge Liang's plan and launches a sneak attack on the enemy camp at night, achieving his first victory. Liu Bei is overwhelmed by Cao Cao and is forced to retreat to Phoenix Heights but is separated from his family during the chaos. Luo is ordered to find and bring Liu's family back safely but fails. Zhang Fei is angered and thrusts his spear towards Luo, but Zhao blocks the attack and engages Zhang and Guan Yu in a fight. Zhao remains undefeated after dueling for several rounds and Liu Bei is impressed by his skill. Zhao offers to retrieve Liu's family, and Guan Yu and Zhang Fei cover him while he breaks through enemy lines to begin the search. Zhao rescues Liu Bei's infant son and holds off dozens of enemy soldiers alone despite being surrounded on all sides. He fights his way out and charges towards Cao Cao, who is observing the battle nearby. Cao is shocked and loses his sword to Zhao, but the latter spares his life and leaps to safety on a cliff. Cao Cao's granddaughter Cao Ying witnesses the attack. Zhao later returns to his hometown Changshan as a hero and falls in love with a girl putting on a shadow puppet show dedicated to him. Zhao continues to fight many battles on Liu Bei's side and earns himself the title of "Invincible General" as he has never lost before. When Liu Bei later becomes emperor of Shu, Zhao is named as one of the Five Tiger Generals, along with Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Ma Chao and Huang Zhong. After Liu Bei's death, Zhuge Liang persuades the new ruler Liu Shan to launch military campaigns against Wei to restore the Han Dynasty. By then Zhao is already 71, and is the sole surviving one of the Five Tiger Generals. He insists on going to battle and is joined by Guan Xing and Zhang Bao and Luo Ping'an. Zhao's army reaches a fork in the road and splits into two forces heading in different directions, one led by Zhao himself while Guan and Zhang command the other. Zhao later encounters the Wei general Han De and slays Han's four sons all by himself. However he is lured into a trap set by the Wei commander Cao Ying and has to retreat to Phoenix Heights. While he is surrounded on all sides and his forces has sustained heavy casualties, Zhao learns that his task is actually to distract the Wei army while Guan Xing and Zhang Bao proceed to capture enemy territory. After attempts by both the Shu and Wei sides to instigate each other into battle, Zhao engages Cao Ying in a duel and defeats her but lets her go. Cao Ying's forces later advance towards Phoenix Heights and Zhao allows his subordinates to lead all his men into battle. The Shu soldiers launch a fierce assault on the Wei army and are nearly all wiped out when Han De sacrifices himself to launch a kamikaze-style attack to blow up the enemy with gunpowder. Zhao and Luo Ping'an watch the battle and aftermath from Phoenix Heights. At the end, Luo reveals that he betrayed Zhao, but the 2 men make peace with one another and Luo helps Zhao remove his armour and tearfully beats the battle drum as Zhao makes a long charge towards the enemy.
