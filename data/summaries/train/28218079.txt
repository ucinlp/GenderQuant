The main plot unfolds in a mountainous village somewhere in Arcadia  shortly after Metapolitefsi. The unveiling of a monument during the Occupation stirred up the topic course, mainly omitting the name Christos Kannavos who was killed in the area. Periklos , a conservative journalist from high school, came to clash with his wife Elpida , even with their two sons Sokratis  and Dimosthenis  which defends Chrysanthi's selfishness  and her family to put a crown in memory of Kannavos.
