The Hole, as it is referred to by local residents, is a five-block neighborhood on the Brooklyn-Queens border surrounded by rumors and mystery. Also known as the 'Jewel Streets', the area is partially flooded and linked to an extensive amount of controversy due to apparent mafia related murders and trash-filled landscape. Nearly cut off completely from the rest of New York City, the neighborhood does not have a sewer system but instead utilizes cesspools. The film features interviews with many residents of The Hole, explores the history of the Federation of Black Cowboys and their relationship with the neighborhood, and documents the landscape of the area.http://courtneysell.com/index2.html
