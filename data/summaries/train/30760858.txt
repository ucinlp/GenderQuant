The lives and destinies of five French characters intersect during the Iraq War. Three young French Arabs  each for a different reason joins a jihadi group to fight against the Americans. Delphine LeGuen, a 40-something French woman running an NGO in Baghdad at the outbreak of the war, gets kidnapped and held by the jihadi insurgents. Meanwhile, a mid-level French diplomat, Hugo Bessieres, uncovers French corruption of the UN Oil for Food program while gathering evidence to support his country's effort to prevent the war.
