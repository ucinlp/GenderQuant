One day in the city, a dog encounters a boy eating corn chips. Irritated by the dog's begging, the boy slaps the dog and sends it crashing into a pile of garbage. Mockingly, the boy licks his fingers, only to discover that he has a hangnail. In attempt to bite the hangnail off, the boy ends up tearing the skin off of his arm. In an act of vengeance, the dog tears the rest of the boy's skin off, exposing his muscles. The film ends with the boy screaming in pain.
