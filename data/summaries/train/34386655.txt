No-nonsense nurse Nora Gilpin doesn't care much for John Raymond Jr., a rich lawyer. Her immediate plans are to marry Tim McCarey, a building contractor, and settle down to a nice, normal life. That night, a sleepwalking Nora slips into a provocative dress and goes to the home of a startled John, behaving seductively. She doesn't reveal her name and he can't figure out where they have met. John spots her on the street one day and excitedly brings up their evening together, but Nora has no idea what he's talking about. He is leaving by train for a business trip, however, when Nora pops up again, playfully cavorting with him for hours at an amusement park. Dr. Jackson is consulted about sleepwalking and thinks Nora's behavior must stem from something in her past. John realizes that he knew her many years ago as the gardener's daughter, but Nora adamantly denies it, continuing to prepare for her wedding day. She packs a suitcase for her honeymoon, but that night, while John waits outside, sure enough, Nora appears again. He rushes her to a Justice of the Peace and she wakes up the next morning in a motel. Embarrassed and unnerved, Nora hurries to her wedding, only to have John interrupt the ceremony by claiming she's already married. Nora faints.
