The griotte Yandé Codou Sène, who is now around 80 years old, is one of the last representatives of the Serer polyphonic poetry. This documentary, shot over four years, is an intimate portrait of the diva that traveled through the history of Senegal by the side of one of the country’s legendary figures, poet President, Léopold Sédar Senghor. A sweet and bitter story about greatness, glory and the passage of time.
