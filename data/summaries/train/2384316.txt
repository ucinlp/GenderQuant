Newly-married Mary Sage  is distraught when her husband Charlie  receives his call-up papers during their wedding breakfast. He travels to Heathercrest National Service Depot, meeting fellow recruit Horace Strong , a terminal hypochondriac who is devastated at having been passed as fit. The new recruits are assigned to Sergeant Grimshawe . Grimshawe is retiring from the army and takes on a Â£50 bet with Sergeant O'Brien  that his last bunch of squaddies will be his first champion platoon.  With beady-eyed inspection from Captain Potts  and disgruntled support from Corporal Copping ([[Bill Owen , Grimshawe decides to use some psychology and treat his charges kindly rather than simply shouting at them. But basic training doesn't start well and he struggles to take his squad through it. They include failure Herbert Brown , upper-class cad Miles Heywood , rock 'n' roller Andy Galloway , delicate flower Peter Golightly ([[Charles Hawtrey  and supercilious university graduate James Bailey . His attempts seem doomed. Mary is determined to spend her wedding night with her husband and smuggles herself into the depot to get a job in the NAAFI, a situation Charlie is eventually able to legitimise. Strong spends most of his time complaining to the Medical Officer, Captain Clark . It is only the adoration of doe-eyed NAAFI girl Norah , which he initially rejects, that makes him realise his potential and inspires to become a real soldier. On the eve of the final tests, Grimshaw is in despair, but he is overheard bemoaning his lot to Copping. The squad decide to win the best platoon prize at all costs. On the day, they indeed beat the other platoons at all tasks and Grimshaw is awarded the cup for best platoon.
