“White Folks”  and “Blue” Howard  are two con men in Philadelphia. White Folks is the son of a white father and a black prostitute mother  whose complexion is light enough for him to pass as a white man. Blue is an older black hustler who raised White Folks and taught him “the con”. The pair pulls off the biggest score of their lives but before they can collect the money a previous con is complicating things. Unbeknownst to them their previous victim had mob ties and now they have run afoul of the Mafia and a corrupt cop. They must decide whether to leave town or risk their lives to collect the $130,000 from their most brilliant con.
