In 1959, a woman commits suicide by leaping from a cliff. At the same time, her daughter Virginia sees her mother's death in a vision. Years later, an adult Virginia  has married rich businessman Francesco Ducci . Ducci leaves on a business trip, and Virginia experiences more visionsâ€”she sees an old woman murdered, a wall being torn down and a letter hidden beneath a statue. Virginia plans to renovate an abandoned mansion her husband has bought, but notices that the building resembles one she has seen in her visions. She tears down a wall in one room, finding a skeleton behind the plaster. Assuming the skeleton is that of the woman in her vision, Virginia contacts the police; however, they do not believe her story and charge Ducci with the killing. Examination of the body reveals it not to be an old woman, but one in her twenties; killed about five years earlier. The skeleton is finally identified as Ducci's ex-girlfriend, who vanished several years ago. Virginia is determined to exculpate her husband, and contacts her friend Luca Fattori . Fattori is a researcher of psychic phenomena, and his investigation eventually leads to the wealthy Emilio Rospini , who may be the true culprit.
