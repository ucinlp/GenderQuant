Jill Deverne is a chorus girl married to alcoholic composer Fred. She wants to show Fred's latest song, A Year From Today, to racketeer Joe Prividi. Prividi is the producer of the musical show she is working in and agrees to use his song. Fred, however, refuses any favours and rejects Prividi's offer. When Prividi uses the song anyway, Fred and his friend Johnny Dolan become drunk and show up at a nightclub. In a raid, the police discover Fred with chorus girl Ruthie. Jill is disgusted with his behavior and dumps him. She is soon courted by Prividi, who is very overprotective. At a private party, a gambler forces himself on her and is shot by Prividi. Prividi is arrested and sent to jail. Jill doesn't want to be left behind and plans a future with Fred. Prividi becomes jealous and sends gunmen to shoot and kill Fred. He is eventually stopped and put in jail, while Jill and Fred ride off in a train to start a new life.
