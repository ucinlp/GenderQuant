The film opens with a parody credit of “R.I. Diculous Presents.” Private Philbrick and Private Penn are stuck in monotonous assignments at Fort Nicholson, a U.S. Army base near the Nicholson Mesa. The privates are assigned to a scouting mission that requires the inspection of a newly discovered cavern that was located near the base. Philbrick and Penn are part of an expeditionary squadron, but become separated from their fellow soldiers. The privates are attacked by strange creatures that take them to an alien spacecraft occupied by Amazonian women from the planet Chalar. Two of the aliens, Professor Puna and Dr. Tanga, reveal they arrived on Earth with the goal of conquering the planet. Philbrick and Penn discover their fellow soldiers have been captured by the aliens. The privates accidentally discover that kissing the aliens leaves them temporarily powerless. After a rapid kissing session, Philbrick and Penn escape from the spaceship and its inhabitants. Dodging an encounter with a hostile American Indian tribe, the two soldiers race back to their base to launch a defense of the Earth against the Chalar aliens.“An Impossible Picture: Truth and Lies about the Invasion of the Star Creatures” by Martin Kottmeyer, Talking Pictures
