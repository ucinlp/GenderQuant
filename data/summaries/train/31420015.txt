Mean Joe is a large black man who protects the children. Sister Mary is a nun. Lady Catherine Tisseu is conservative and stiff. Ten-Four knows how to cut a business deal. These are just some of the 92 personalities that Truddi Chase came to refer to as "The Troops". These Troops first came to her rescue while, as a two year old, she was systematically sexually assaulted by her sadistic stepfather  in a cornfield. In addition to torture and sexual abuse, the stepfather also battered Truddi's mother beyond reclamation and chained a dog in their yard, withholding food and water until the canine finally dies. As the torture and sexual abuse worsen, more Troops arrived to aid Truddi. In young adult life, Truddi marries a loving husband , who she meets while working at an advertising agency. Eventually, daughter Page arrives and as Truddi's condition worsens, she seeks therapy to attempt to repair herself and her family. The miniseries begins with Truddi telephoning her therapist  and telling him she has located her former stepfather in upstate New York and is on her way to kill him.{{cite news}}
