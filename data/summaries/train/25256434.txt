Don Vito Leoni, the Godfather, is clinically depressed. The world has changed and he hasn't. He'd like to retire, but if he left the "family business" to his two idiot sons, they'd be dead in a minute. So he decides to go legit, which convinces everyone that he must be completely off the deep end. To preserve their cushy lives, his dysfunctional family conspires to get him some psychotherapy. So his boys kidnap a "paisan" shrink, and order him to "fix" their father.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124023/plotsummary
