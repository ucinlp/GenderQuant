Reminiscent of the popular Douglas Fairbanks swashbuckler films of the 1920s, Cruise of the Jasper B stars actor Rod La Rocque as 'Jerry Cleggert', a good-natured descendant of an infamous clan of pirates who resides aboard the rickety ship Jasper B. Cleggert is informed that in order to inherit a large inheritance, he must marry by his twenty-fifth birthday - otherwise he would relinquish all claims to his impending fortune. Jerry soon meets his ideal would-be bride Agatha Fairhaven  and the two immediately fall in love. Complications arise when Jerry's cousin, the dastardly lawyer Reginald Maltravers  claims Agatha as his own. The courting couple suffer a series of mishaps on the way to altar; they are waylaid en route by a trio of bandits, escape from a runaway taxi cab, and outrun a mob of unscrupulous state authorities. The weary couple finally manage to wed just before the deadline on board the Jasper B and Cleggert inherits his family fortune.
