Beaky Buzzard is sent to bring home something to eat. While his brothers fetch a milk cow , a string of circus elephants  and a dog attached to a fire hydrant, Beaky manages to capture a baby bumble bee. The bee's mother then comes and stings Beaky, who falls down near a lake. There he sees the small head of what turns out to be a large dragon. Beaky starts running from the dragon, and the scene changes to the mother buzzard worrying about her son not returning home until late at night. When he comes, she is both glad that he came and angry that he brought nothing for dinner. However, when the camera moves down, it is revealed that he has eventually caught the dragon, who dismisses the mother's claim by saying "Well now, I wouldn't say that!" .
