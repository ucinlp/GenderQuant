Four retired mobsters  plan one last crime to save their apartment at a retirement home . The four steal a corpse from the mortuary to use as the "victim" in a staged murder scene. Unknown to them, the body belonged to the head of a Colombian drug smuggling ring. As a result of the "murder", many of the young renters leave and the four men are given cash and a rent discount by the complex to keep living there. Much of this money is spent on high living and women, which causes a young woman  to believe that the four men staged the murder. To keep the woman quiet, the four agree to kill her stepmother , but instead kidnap her and fake her death by setting fire to her mansion. In the process, they accidentally burn down the house of the drug-smuggler's son , who happened to live in a nearby mansion. Believing that someone is trying to usurp his power, the drug lord offers $100,000 to anyone who brings him the head of the man responsible. This results in a confrontation at the apartment, leading to the capture of a female police officer and her partner , one of the wiseguys , the young woman, and the stepmother. The other wiseguys manage to escape this conflict, and track down the men who kidnapped their friend. They call in all of their still-living former associates from their active years and lay siege to the ship where the drug lord is holding his prisoners. They then turn the ship and the drug smugglers over to the police, along with a shipment of drugs. A truckload of Cuban cigars is taken by the men and used to make their apartment complex into "a retirement home for old wiseguys who are down on their luck." A sub-plot of the movie involves Richard Dreyfuss' search for his long lost daughter , whom he hasn't seen since he was in his 30s and she was a small child.
