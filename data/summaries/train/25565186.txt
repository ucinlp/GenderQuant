Jenna Davis  always loved to work, and put her career before everything, including her relationship. But that all changed when she found out she was pregnant with a girl she named Madeline. Determined to be a good mother, and soon to go on maternity leave, Jenna's doctors inform her she'll need to be on bedrest, so she will need a nurse to come by and do check ups. When Lynn Mallory  shows up, she's as pleasant as can be, and gives Jenna some new vitamins, which promptly knock her out. When Jenna awakens in the hospital, she sees the father of her baby , Tom Robbins , and that he now knows that it was his baby too. When a doctor comes in and tells her that her baby was stillborn, she is in disbelief. Soon after, a police detective comes in to question her, informing her that they believe her daughter wasn't stillborn but murdered, that the vitamins she took earlier were not vitamins and caused her to go into labor, and that the detective believes she murdered the baby to protect her career. Jenna remembers that she got the pills from Lynn Mallory and asks to speak with her. When she is informed that there is no Lynn Mallory at the hospital, she becomes suspicious, which only grows when she learns the child's remains were supposedly cremated. She begins to suspect that Lynn stole her baby. Jenna and Tom are determined to find out what happened to Madeline, and embark on a second chance on romance, which leads them to a baby broker connected to Lynn.
