Victor Scott  is a District Attorney with a drive to win every case. He is assisted by fellow attorney Ellen Miles  who is not quite as hard-driving, but is devoted to her D.A. boss. After Scott discovers that one of the men he sent to his death is innocent, he falls into a drunken haze, is arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct, and determines to defend one of his fellow incarcerated. This leads to a new career as a defense attorney. In the process Scott ends up defending an associate of the city's crime boss, a man he refused to work for earlier in the film due to the fact that “...no one would testify against you; you own the people who work for you”. This, in turn, leads him into direct confrontation with the very office he used to head. Over the course of the film Ellen Miles' kills her husband in self defense and Scott determines to defend her as there are no witnesses. There is a sub-plot here involving Ellen Miles husband, the crime boss, and an ongoing leak between the D.A.s office and the crime boss. The leak turns out to be Ellen's husband, Ray Borden. The new D.A., not knowing this, determines that Ellen herself is the leak and that she has murdered her husband when found out. There is also a shorter story arc in which Scott is encouraged and mentored by Ellen Miles' father. As Ms. Miles's father lies on his death-bed, Scott promises to protect Ms. Miles. As such he acts as surrogate father and mentor to Ms. Miles, encouraging her career as an attorney. There is also a hint that the relationship between Miles and Scott might have been a romantic one had Scott allowed it. Angel O'Hara  plays a small yet important role as witness for the defense. Her testimony places the role of “leak” firmly in the lap of Ray Borden , whom she testifies has had continuing contact with the crime boss, Frank Garland .
