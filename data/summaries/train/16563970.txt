When jockey Chris Kirby  is fatally injured in a horse race, he gets his best friend, gambler Adam Black , to promise to take care of his teenage daughter, Evelyne , who has been raised apart from her father. Unbeknownst to Adam, Evelyne had been led to believe that Adam is her father in correspondence between parent and child. Adam is unable to tell her the truth; his butler and friend Bill Murray  tries and fails as well. Finally, Adam's sometime girlfriend Moira  breaks the news to the girl. Adam sends Evelyne to an exclusive boarding school. When she has grown up, she reappears unexpectedly in his life. Because of the hatred she has for gambling, Adam does not reveal that he stages illegal gambling sessions; instead he tells her that he makes his money on the stock exchange. She begins casually dating Adam's no-good brother Roddy . When Adam tells Moira that he is getting out of the business, she accuses him of being in love with his "ward". Roddy has his own grudge against his brother - Adam refuses to finance a shady deal - and the two of them tip off the police about Adam's last operation. Roddy also brings Evelyne to see what Adam really does for a living. Shocked, she quarrels with Adam and leaves. A kindly gambler, Colonel Bradley , gives her some sage advice and convinces her to reconcile with Adam.
