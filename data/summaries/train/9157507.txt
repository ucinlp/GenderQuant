Two 12-year-old girls, Charlotte "Charlie" Palfy from Berlin and Louise Kr√∂ger from Hamburg, meet on a train going to a language school in Scotland. They are shocked to see how much they look alike. They soon find out that they are identical twins. Shortly after their birth, their parents split up, and each of them took one girl. Neither girl knew that she had a twin sister, and they both believed their other parent dead. Though they look alike, they are very different in personality. Charlie, as the daughter of a music hall composer, is cool, self-confident and somewhat impolite, dresses accordingly and listens to techno music. Louise, who grew up with her mother, who works in advertising, wears conservative clothing and is rather shy and quiet. The two girls concoct a plan to find out why they were separated by their parents. Charlie travels to their mother in Hamburg, pretending to be Louise, who in turn pretends to be Charlie and travels to their father in Berlin. Much chaos ensues as both girls try to settle into their new lives without anyone noticing the difference. The girls' situation gets even more difficult when they realise that both parents have new partners, whom they intend to marry. In the end, Charlie and Louise can think of no other way than to run away in order to get their parents back together. They travel to Scotland and hide in an old light-house, from which they are rescued by their parents. Back in Hamburg, the father agrees that both girls can stay with their mother. He gets on the train back to Berlin, but before the train has pulled out of the station, he finds a note by Charlie in his pocket saying "Es gibt Momente im Leben, da muss man die Notbremse ziehen" . He pulls the emergency brake, leaves the train and decides to stay with his family after all.
