After the suicide of her father, Daniella  investigates her family's past. The plot involves a sect called the Abrahamites, who  sacrifice their first borns following an alternative interpretation of God's Will in the near-sacrifice of Isaac. Caravaggio's Ufizzi version of the biblical scene is shown in the movie to illustrate this alternative belief. The movie version of the Abrahamites traditionally give their first borns the father's middle name, hence the title of the movie.
