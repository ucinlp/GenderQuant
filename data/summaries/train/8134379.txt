A young journalism student Mari gets a summer job in a small country newspaper. While trying to socialise with the local people, she meets a shy and mildly retarded young man who has the habit of going naked around the village. Liberal Mari slowly gets to know the guy a little better, but a friendship with the village idiot certainly won't make her life easier.
