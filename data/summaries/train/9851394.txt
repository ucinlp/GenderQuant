 Tom's owner, Clint, is grilling steaks in his backyard. The steak's scent reaches Jerry, who is aroused by it and is led to the steak. He then tries to eat it but is captured by Tom, who uses his grill fork to catapult him back into the house. Jerry then returns to retrieve the steak, and encounters Tom once more. The two of them fight using grill forks until Tom inadvertently sticks Clint on the rear, who retaliates by squashing Tom's head flat in a red-hot steak holder. Jerry next hides in a badminton shuttlecock and tries to sneak onto the table, but Tom hits him with a racket. The shuttlecock gets caught in the net and rebounds into Clint's mouth, whereupon he breaks the racket over Tom's head. Tom then tries to stop Jerry from opening a freshly shaken bottle of Kooky Kola, but he is too late; the soda ruins one of Clint's steaks, so Tom is forced to gulp down a second shaken bottle. Once Tom recovers, he chases Jerry across the yard only to get his tail trapped in the grill. Tom dashes across the backyard, still attached to the grill, knocking Clint over in the process. He dives into the swimming pool to cool off, prompting Clint to tie him to a lounge chair so he will stay out of trouble. Jerry hooks the chair to the rear bumper of a passing car at a stop light just before the car drives away, taking Tom and the chair with it. Finally, Clint goes back to his grilling in peace, and Jerry reaches the table and starts eating one of the steaks.
