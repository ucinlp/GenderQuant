Butch wins the heart of Darla, leaving heartbroken Alfalfa to cry in his alphabet soup. Mistaking the boy's doldrums for indigestion, Alfalfa's dad prepares to give his son a good dose of "Settles-It" Powder. Later on, the kids pay a visit to Butch's jerry-built chemistry lab, where the young troublemaker is mixing up what he claims is an explosive. Recognizing the mixture as Settles-It Powder, the crafty Alfalfa offers himself as Butch's guinea pig, "bravely" downing the concoction in hopes of impressing Darla. Alas, the powders haven't been properly combined, and before long Alfalfa becomes drastically bloated and the rest of the gang is convinced that he has become a walking bomb.<ref namehttp://movies.nytimes.com/movie/226200/Bubbling-Troubles/overview |title2008-10-08|work=NY Times}}
