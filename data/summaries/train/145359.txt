The crew of the starship USS Enterprise enjoys shore leave after the ship's shakedown cruise goes poorly. Captain James T. Kirk is camping with Spock and Dr. Leonard McCoy at Yosemite National Park. Their leave is interrupted when Enterprise is ordered by Starfleet Command to rescue three ambassadors  who are held as hostages on the planet Nimbus III. In space, the Klingon Captain Klaa is bored destroying space refuse and longs for a real battle; when he learns Enterprise is heading to Nimbus III he decides to fight Kirk for personal glory and sets his ship on an intercept course. Enterprise successfully breaches the barrier, pursued by Klaa's vessel, and discovers a planet within. Sybok, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy journey to the surface, where Sybok calls out to his perceived vision of God. An entity appears, and when told of how Sybok breached the barrier, demands that the starship be brought closer to the planet. When a skeptical Kirk inquires, "What does God need with a starship?" the entity attacks him. The others doubt that a being who would inflict harm for pleasure could be God.
