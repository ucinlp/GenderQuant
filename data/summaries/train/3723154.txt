Philipp Wermeer has been framed for the murder of a powerful figure known as The Patriarch. Wermeer escapes, but the three Saxon brothers, sons of The Patriarch, have arranged for a large bounty on Wermeer's head. Clayton is a grizzled ex-sheriff stripped of his office in Jefferson after refusing to acknowledge Wermeer's guilt. During a series of fire-fights, Clayton contrives to help Wermeer escape from attacks of bounty-hunters. Together, the two make their way to Saxon City, where they can confront the three powerful Saxon brothers, and reveal the surprising truth about who killed The Patriarch. The film's music was composed by future Academy Award winner Luis Enr√≠quez Bacalov. The film's title score was later used in Quentin Tarantino's film Kill Bill Vol. 1.
