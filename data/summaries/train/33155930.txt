In 1793, during the French Revolution, a young woman named Céline , who was adopted by Count Savinien de Kerfadec, must choose between two men who have been raised like her brothers, Tarquin Larmor  and Aurèle de Kerfadec , while they take opposite sides in the conflict. Tarquin, also adopted by the Count, is a partisan of the New Republic and defends the new political system; Aurèle, the Count's natural son, supports the Royalist side. Both sons are in love with Céline. After the Republican Army decimates Western France, an insurgence of peasants, clergy, and aristocrats loyal to the Royalists stage a counterrevolution.
