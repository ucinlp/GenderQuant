Calvin Graham , a 12-year-old boy who looks older than his age, shows up at a naval base in uniform with a set of sealed orders. After his orders are reviewed, he is arrested  and taken to the brig. In prison, he has a series of flashbacks during which he forges his mother's signature to enlist in the U.S. Navy, completes basic training and is assigned to the {{USS}}. Graham unsuccessfully tries to get himself released from prison by saying he is underage, but nobody believes him. He then learns that he's in prison for desertion and, as a result, is unable to get any messages out. When Graham is asked about a wound in the back of his head, he remembers the USS South Dakota fighting in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. One of Graham's shipmates is killed, and several others, including Graham, are wounded. Lauding Graham's bravery, the ship's captain recommends him for two Purple Hearts. Graham's ship enters port in New York for repairs, but when Graham learns that his grandmother has died, he asks to go to Texas to attend her funeral. The ship's executive officer, who has assumed command, gives Graham a four-day pass, knowing he cannot make it back in time, but telling him to go to the recruiting office in Texas and turn himself in. Graham reports as ordered, expecting his story about being underage to be verified so he can be released. However, as depicted in the opening scenes, he is arrested instead. Graham spends his 13th birthday being nearly worked to death by abusive guards who refuse to believe him. Meanwhile, his sister receives an anonymous phone call telling her that Graham is in the brig. After pleading with the Provost Marshal gets her nowhere, she goes to the newspaper, which finally gets her brother released. As Graham is reunited with his sister, the viewers learn that in 1978, Graham's medals were restored and he was given an honorable discharge, while his veterans' benefits were still pending .
