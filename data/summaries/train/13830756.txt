Brutalized in and out of the prison system during early 20th century America, Panzram unleashed a rampage of revenge that resulted in over 20 murders and countless acts of violent sodomy. A single act of kindness, by prison guard Henry Lesser, sparked a friendship that eventually influenced Panzram to write his autobiography. In 1930, Panzram was eventually hanged for killing a prison foreman. Panzram marks the third feature film for producer/writer/director John Borowski. Borowski has achieved international acclaim for his documentaries on early American serial killers, including H. H. Holmes: America's First Serial Killer and Albert Fish.
