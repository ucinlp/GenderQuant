In Amsterdam Harry and Jo go to the auction but Georg is late, because he's stopping the boat at a place for carriage boats. When he comes to the auction he's told that the Renoire is sold very cheap to a young guy. Appearantly Jo accidentally bought the paining, because he didn't knew the hand-raise-rule of the auction.
