{{Unreferenced}} It was a dream come true for Meghaa Banerjee, a small town girl in West Bengal, India when she earned a scholarship from the prestigious University of New South Wales in Australia to pursue her Masters degree in Economics with inevitable butterflies in her stomach. She embarks upon her maiden expedition to Sydney leaving her protective shell and family behind. Coming from a conservative middle class background, life and culture in Sydney was an instant eye opener for her. Under guidance of her caring cousin Kalpana fondly called "Kol", Meghaa slowly embraces her new life in Sydney where she makes new set of friends, which includes cherubic Lubaina, prankster Raj, and narcissistic Suhail. Love and romance was something that was strictly not in her agenda of things. However being young at heart it was just something waiting to happen to her when she met Rohit - a charismatic, full of sheen and friendly natured fellow student in the University with whom she starts gelling right from the beginning.
