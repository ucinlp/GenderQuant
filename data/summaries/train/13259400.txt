A U.S. Customs Agent, Victor "Vic" Cooper , is about to make a drug bust as a plane lands, but the pilot  and the plane are searched and no evidence is found. Cooper later suspects that the drugs are being jettisoned by parachute and goes to a drop zone to investigate. He notices a picture of the pilot and then seeks to infiltrate a group of skydivers, led by a man named Red Line , believing they are involved in drug smuggling. The group is training for an upcoming competition where teams compete to be the fastest to form a ring formation of eight people during free-fall. Cooper trains in a vertical wind tunnel with a man in the Army, Delmira , in order to quickly improve his skills. Cooper falls for a woman in the group named Star  and clashes with another member of the group named Turbo . Lieutenant Brian Margate  questions Agent Cooper's judgement and later questions his loyalty as Cooper becomes more and more enmeshed in the group. The term "cutaway" is used in reference to the jumpers cutting away  from the former life  to skydive.
