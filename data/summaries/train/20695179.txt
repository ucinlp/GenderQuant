Ki-bong is a mentally challenged forty year-old man who lives in a rural village with his ageing mother. After accidentally winning a local race, Ki-bong finds himself training for the National Amateur Half Marathon so that he can buy his mother some false teeth with the prize money. Despite being coached by the head of the village, Mr. Baek, the villagers remain sceptical about his chances of winning, all except for the girl who works in the local photo shop.
