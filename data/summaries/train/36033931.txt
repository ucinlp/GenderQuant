Shot in documentary style, the narration spans 60 years, chronicling not only the incidents and people that helped mould Kamaraj but also touching upon the important events in Indias history and how it affected him and vice versa. The narration is divided into three phases. The pre-Independence period, depicting Kamarajs childhood, the influence of Satyamurthy, Kamarajs growth as a politician and his prison life. The second phase depicts his taking over as the Congress Chief Minister of the state, the reforms he tries to bring in, especially in education, his largesse and his bending the rules for a good cause-like for the urgent eye-operation of a kid. It also displayed his sense of humour , his refusal to take advantage of his position . The third phase where he puts forth the Kamaraj Plan, resigns from the post of CM, involves himself in party work; his influence on national politics, his emergence as a kingmaker and finally his disillusionment with the emerging non-ethics in political life. The closing scene , show swarms of humanity mourning the death of their beloved leader. Richard Madhuram fits well in the role, his resemblance to Kamaraj helping him, the guidance of the director aiding him to give a controlled and a subtle performance.
