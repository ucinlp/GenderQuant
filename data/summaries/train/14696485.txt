It's been five years since Terry  and his friend, Glen, accidentally opened up the Gate in Glen's back yard, and those five years have certainly not been an easy time for him. Glen's family has moved away, and Terrence's broken family has gotten even worse. Still grieving over his mom's death, and with his dad wallowing in alcoholism, he finds himself increasingly drawn to the evil portal and the incredible power it possesses. His mind made up, he breaks into Glen's old house and begins the dark ritual to summon the demons and grant him the power to get his father's life back on track. He is interrupted, however, by three other teens who also happened to break into the house. While John and Moe are content to ridicule Terrence, John's girlfriend, Liz proves herself to be extremely interested in demonology, and convinces her two friends to join Terrence in completing the ritual. Back on track, Terrence proves he knows what he's doing and successfully brings a Minion  through the Gate. In a panic, John pulls out his revolver and shoots it, then storms off with his friends in tow. Alone, Terrence finds the Minion's body and takes it home. It survives, so Terrance opts to keep it in a cage as a pet. The next day, Terrence is shocked to find that his wish has seemingly come true. His father, once a proud airline pilot, has given up the bottle and netted a job flying for a major carrier. In fact, when Liz comes over later, they discover they can use the Minion to grant any wish they want...but with dire consequences.
