Summer 2006, Kinshasa. Martini, Jeannette, Hélène and Rosette spend everyday sparring with Coach Judex in the old Tata Rafael stadium; the same one where Muhammad Ali knocked out George Foreman in 1974 during one of the most legendary matches in boxing.

While others fight for the Presidency of Congo, Judex struggles to organise a woman’s boxing tournament with very little money...
