For over 30 years, Ralph has been doing the same job and has become tired of being the villain. Wanting to prove he can be a hero and not just a villain, Ralph escapes his game through a power cord and lands in Hero's Duty, a light-gun shooter game{{cite web}} where he helps the game's hero, Sergeant Calhoun, battle against "Cy-Bugs" . He later enters Sugar Rush, a kart racing game set on tracks made of candies, cookies and other sweets. There, Ralph meets one of the game's characters, Vanellope von Schweetz, who has learned that her game is faced with a dire threat that could affect the entire arcade, and one that Ralph may have inadvertently started.<ref nameB.
