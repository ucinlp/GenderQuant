Brigitte Bardot plays Sophie, a young model who discovers her boyfriend is thinking of leaving her for another woman, leading her to plot deadly revenge in this French romantic comedy. Directed by Bardot’s former husband Roger Vadim, the film features a nude dance sequence, which was controversially risqué at the time of the film’s release. Michel Subor was cast as Bardot’s fraught suitor in the role that made him famous. Sophie is not content with the status quo in her relationship with high-flying reporter boyfriend Philippe , but she is even less impressed when wealthy American girl Barbara  threatens to steal him from her. She resolves to win Philippe back or murder her rival, and enlists her doctor friend Alain to aid her in making him jealous. Sophie and Alain travel from Paris to the ski resorts of Italy to chase Philippe and Barbara, treating us to marvelous French comedy in the mischief that ensues.
