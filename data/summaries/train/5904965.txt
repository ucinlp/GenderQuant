The film revolves around three people - Lord Nicholas Dorset and his wife Britt, for whom luxury is a necessity, and their bank manager Mr. Graham. Over the years Mr. Graham has devised a plan to rob his own bank. His clients desperate financial straits make them ideal accomplices in his eyes, but to ensure their loyalty he makes love to Britt after sending her husband away, and bribes Nick with a retainer. The robbery scheme is dependent on timing and must be carried out on a Friday - the perfect Friday. With careful planning the simple, neat crime is eventually accomplished. But when their perfect crime has been completed each mistrusts the other - and with Â£300,000 at stake the three robbers have a lot to lose. It is noted for its snappy dialogue and charming chemistry between Baker and Andress. The underlying message of the film is about class in 1970s Britain. It has not yet been released on DVD.
