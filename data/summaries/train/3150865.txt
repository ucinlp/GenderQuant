Porky Pig is trying to get on a plane to play golf. However, Daffy Duck, agent to the stars, complete with business card that flashes like a theater marquis, stops him , and does everything he can to convince him that his preteenager client "Sleepy LaGoon" can become a star. This annoys Porky so much, as he is trying to get on his plane. Daffy spends most of the cartoon telling Porky about what his client can do, while actually performing various schticks himself, in his usual wild and frenetic way. After trying various ways to escape, Porky locks Daffy in a huge vault and takes off in a plane only to find out that the pilot of the plane is Daffy. Porky then jumps out with a parachute only to notice the parachute is again Daffy. Porky then gets chased back to his office. Finally, having stopped Daffy, Porky relents and asks to see what his client can do. "Sleepy", a small and droopy-eyed duck who has whiled away the episode slurping a huge all-day sucker which he keeps in a banjo case, finally gets to perform. "Sleepy" begins to sing a song  are in a strong baritone voice. He starts out well, then tries to hit a high note, and goes into a coughing fit.
