An intern is shot mysteriously on an East River pier adjoining Bellevue Hospital. The chief investigating detective views this as a difficult case, so with the cooperation of the Commissioner of Hospitals he assigns a detective who had been a medical corpsman, Fred Rowan of the Confidential Squad, to go undercover as intern "Fred Gilbert." Rowan becomes involved with the attractive nurse Ann Sebastian , and also becomes friendly with the popular elevator operator, Pop Ware . Ware, who works part-time taking bets, seems initially to be a benign character. But it becomes apparent that Ware has been loaning money to the interns, including the slain intern and another intern, Rowan's roommate Steve Anderson , who is depressed and commits suicide. Rowan deliberately loses money betting with Ware, and Ware says that Rowan can pay off his bet by stealing "white stuf" -- narcotics. Rowan plays along, encouraged by Ann Sebastian. He stops providing drugs to Ware. Ware tries to kill Rowan, and is shot in a shootout on the roof of the hospital. Investigators find that the nurse was worked as a courier for Ware. The movie ends with Rowan, turning aside pleas from Ann, placing her under arrest.
