A concentration camp survivor named Samuel Berg , a preternaturally lucky fellow, runs a European casino. One of his workers is Federico , a man who "steals" other people's luck merely by laying a hand on them. When Samuel Berg has a falling out with Federico and takes away his powers, Federico sets out to find the luckiest man alive , the lone survivor of a plane crash, in order to use his powers to overpower Samuel Berg in the one game he has never lost: Russian roulette. Federico takes his partner through a series of tests in order to confirm his abilities. In the process, they approach the tightening circle of underground chance games that will eventually lead them both, and a female cop on their heels, to a final showdown with Samuel Berg.
