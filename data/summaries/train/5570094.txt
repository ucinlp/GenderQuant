Dr. Anton Drager  travels to Java to study the effects of leprosy under an expert on the subject, Dr. Brits Jansen . The two physicians have many of the same views scientifically, but are philosophically a mismatch, because Drager does not share the older Jansen's belief in a god. After being married with his sweetheart, Els , Drager must trek into the jungle to track down Frolick , a drunken river master who is lost. Frolick has been driven mad by a voodoo doctor called Burubi . Drager eventually comes across Frolick, but ends up killing him in self-defense. After rescuing another doctor, in the same region, Anton becomes lost in the wild. He nearly dies and has lapsed into a coma by the time he is rescued. His ordeal comes to change his perceptions and agree more with Jansen on one's need to believe in the goodness of others and to maintain faith.
