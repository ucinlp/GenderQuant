Set in the 1980s, the story focuses on Diana Moffit, a likable 17-year-old teenager. Trouble starts when her parents decide to file for divorce. She takes the split very hard and begins a relationship with A.J., a 26-year-old man who turns out to be a pimp. He lures her into the world of drugs and prostitution, which results into dropping out of school, quiting her job and estrangement from her mother Gayle. Gayle is devastated by this news and even goes as far as confronting Diana in a strip club where she is working. Desperate to save her daughter, she often confronts her and starts looking for ways to do something about it. Diana sometimes shows interest in her old life, but she has trouble breaking out of the dark world she is living in. Diana is eventually mysteriously murdered, much to the horrible distress of Gayle, who strongly feels that A.J. is responsible. Determined to get A.J. behind bars, she contacts the police, but they can't find a way to charge him. Looking for another related charge, she meets April, one of his prostitutes. Soon, she starts to get information from her which could enable her to successfully charge him with the murder of her daughter.
