In Paris during 1890, 104-year-old Georges Bonnet  is a sculptor who maintains a youthful appearance by regularly murdering women and using their parathyroid glands as an elixir to ward off the signs of age. When Bonnet requires a vital surgery to be undertaken he asks his old colleague Prof. Ludwig Weiss  to perform it. He declines and Bonnet then blackmails Pierre Gerard  into performing the operation by endangering the life of Janine Dubois , a young lady both Bonnet and Gerard are romantically interested in.
