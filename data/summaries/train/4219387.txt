In the morning, he goes out surfing with Alex and Mark and realizes that surfing in the ocean is totally different to surfing in a wave tank and he is not as good as he had initially thought. During this scene he gets in the way of Vince, leader of the local group the Hui  and , which causes Vince to wipe out and leads to a confrontation where he is chased off the beach after he realizes his stuff was stolen from the beach by a member of the Hui. With nowhere to go, he fortuitously runs into Turtle . Kane meets and falls in love with Kiani , a beautiful local girl who helps him acclimate to the local culture and customs.
