It is the early 1900s. Distinguished philosopher Leopold  and his much younger fianc√©e, Ariel , are going to spend a weekend in the country with Leopold's cousin Adrian  and her crackpot inventor husband Andrew . Also on the guest list is womanising doctor Maxwell  and his latest girlfriend, free-thinking nurse, Dulcy . Over the course of the weekend, old romances reignite, new romances develop, and everyone ends up sneaking off behind everyone else's backs.
