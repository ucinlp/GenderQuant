Finding himself in considerable debt, Chris Smith, a Texan drug dealer, decides the only solution is to murder his mother to collect the insurance money. Conspiring with his father, Ansel, the ex-husband of Chris' mother, they decide to hire "Killer Joe" Cooper, a police detective who has a parallel career as a contract killer. They plan to give the money to Chris' sister Dottie, who Chris thinks is the beneficiary of the mother's life insurance policy. Chris is unable to front Killer Joe's fee. However, Chris agrees that Joe can take Dottie as a retainer until the insurance comes through. Acting upon the retainer, Killer Joe carries out the contract on Chris' mother. After the killing, it is discovered that Rex, her boyfriend, provided false information about the life insurance policy and that he is the actual beneficiary. Also, Chris' step-mother, Sharla, who is also involved with Rex, pushed Chris into hiring Killer Joe. When he discovers this, Killer Joe confronts Rex, kills him, and recovers the insurance check. Chris, knowing that he will be Killer Joe's next target, quickly makes plans to escape to Peru with Dottie. In the final scene, Killer Joe arrives at the Chris' trailer and violently confronts Sharla, forcing her to admit that she and Rex conspired against Chris and left him at the mercy of Killer Joe. Since the family is unable to pay his fee, Killer Joe intends to take Dottie as agreed. When Chris arrives and threatens Killer Joe with a gun, the two struggle. In the subsequent confusion, Dottie recovers the gun and shoots Chris, killing him and mortally wounding their father. Dottie turns the gun on Killer Joe, telling him that she is pregnant. Killer Joe feigns enthusiasm as he inches closer to Dottie. The film ends as Dottie moves her finger back on the trigger.
