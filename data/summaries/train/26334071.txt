A junior minister in the British Government discovers a terrorist plot to detonate a nuclear device in London. Putting self-preservation first, he flees with a young American political advisor to a re-commissioned Secret Nuclear Underground Bunker â€“ S.N.U.B. They find themselves trapped in the bunker with a group of individuals caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. The terrorist bomb is found, but before the disposal experts can disarm the device, it explodes, destroying central London and contaminating the countryside. As a result dangerous convicts break out from a local high security prison. They are contaminated with radiation and begin to mutate. The mutants infiltrate the bunker and one by one the occupants endure a grisly death. Eventually one of the survivors escapes to make contact with the outside world and a rescue helicopter is organised.
