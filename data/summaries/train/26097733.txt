Neo, a drifter from the atomic-blasted wastelands, and his klutzy robot sidekick arrive at a factory where slaves labor to fuel the Dark One's Power Station. He meets a woman who convinces him to help rescue her father, a scientist who invented a device that can break the Dark One's control over the factory slaves. Gathering a motley crew of allies on the way, Neo goes to the Power Station to confront the Dark One's evil servants.
