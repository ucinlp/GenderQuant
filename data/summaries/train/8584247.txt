 A disturbed wedding video cameraman and his assistant tape over a horror film that the audience has supposedly just rented, breaking the fourth wall and using meta-reference he then shows the audience his gruesome activities as a serial killer. The film raises questions surrounding visceral pleasure, this can be seen in one scene in particular during which the audience cannot see the victims  being murdered, Max Parry then asks the audience "I bet a part of you wanted to see that, and if you didn't, why are you still watching?" At the end of the film the audience is left to think that the copy of Last Horror Movie they are watching is the only one, and that they will become part of Max Parry's sick lesson.
