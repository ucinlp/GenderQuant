Twilight Dancers offers a disturbing yet a humorous look at the country's social realities through the eyes of three macho dancers or male strippers. One of them is Dwight , young and at the peak of his trade who loses the girl he loves to a politician's son. Then there's Alfred, who at 28, is past his prime and is kicked out of the club. Finally there's Bert, 30, who has long since given up dancing and is now the bodyguard-driver of a corrupt businesswoman. But Bert's boss, Madame Loca , manipulates the events that push the three dancers to fight for survival, and to finally confront issues of love, friendship and betrayal. Adding to these conflicts are a deaf-mute wife who refuses to go back to her macho dancer husband, a director who keeps promising stardom to a male dancer named Michael , a transvestite performer who fakes being a virgin as well, a tyrannical mayor who cross-dresses at his birthday party, and a union leader who gets shot by an assassin in broad daylight. But as their club's manager Taurus always says, "They are only here to serve the carnal desires of men. The show has to go on." Twilight Dancers is the third movie from director Mel Chionglo about Philippine's macho dancer industry.
