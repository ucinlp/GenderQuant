Amir, the benevolent ruler of Kalid, is dying, but there is hope in transplanting his brain into another body. Freshly deceased, he is flown to the United States where Dr. Trenton, having unwisely put off body acquisition until the last minute, transplants Amir's brain into the body of the disfigured simpleton assistant who failed in said chore. Dr. Trenton has a few nefarious plot twists of his own in mind, and then there's the thing with the dwarf and the woman chained in the basement. It's up to Amir's friend Bob and wife Tracey to try to salvage this tale.
