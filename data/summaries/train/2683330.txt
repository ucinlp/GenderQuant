The wealthy lawyer Dick Russell ([[John Howard  funds the dotty old inventor Professor Gibbs  to create an invisibility device. The first test subject for this machine is Kitty Carroll , a department store model who had been fired from her previous job. The machine proves quite successful, and Kitty uses her invisible state to pay back her former sadistic boss, Mr. Growley ([[Charles Lane . While the Professor and the invisible Kitty are off visiting the lodge of the millionaire Russell, the gangster Blackie Cole  sends in his gang of moronic thugs  to steal the device. With the machine back at their hideout, however, they cannot get it to work. By now Kitty has returned to visibility, and the thugs are sent in to kidnap her and Gibbs. However, she has learned that some alcohol will restore her to invisibility, and uses this to defeat the gang . At the end of the film it is revealed she has married and become a mother. To top it off, she and the professor learns that her treatment has apparently affected her DNA--as her infant son vanishes upon being rubbed with an alcohol-based lotion! At the time of its release, this film was considered slightly risqu√© because much is made of the fact that the heroine, though invisible, is naked during much of the action.{{Citation needed}}
