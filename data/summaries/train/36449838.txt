Fifteen years ago, three childhood friends, Geki Jumonji, Shelly and Toya Okuma, were star-gazing and became inspired to go into space. As adults, Geki and Okuma joins SARD and took a mission to Mars before they are labled MIA when their space shuttle mysteriously disappeared while on course due to a strange vortex. It is revealed a year later that Gavan, known on Earth as Retsu Ichijouji, has been training Geki as his replacement to fight the revived Don Horror and his newly recreated Space Mafia Maku. Joining Geki are the successors to Space Sheriffs Sharivan and Shaider, Kai Hyuga and Shu Karasuma.
