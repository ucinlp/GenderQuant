The film starts out at the Farnborough Airshow where a demo Mirage 2000-5 is stolen. Captains Antoine Walk'in Marchelli  and SÃ©bastien Fahrenheit Vallois  are instructed to escort it back. They find the rogue Mirage flying stealthy under a Qatar Airways Airbus A340. They get the order to abort when the rogue Mirage is about to fire on Fahrenheit. Walk'in is forced to shoot the demo Mirage down when it is about to fire a R550 Magic missile at his wingman, disobeying an order which results in Marchelli being kicked out of the air force. Vallois resigns when informed by Marchelli. They get a promise to be reinstated if they fly a Cannonball race over hostile territory to the Horn of Africa for Special Missions to help sell the Mirage to an Asian customer. Its competition consists of an F-16. During the race, their tanker does not show up for in-flight refueling because terrorists have killed the crew. This forces the Mirages to land in hostile territory where their aircraft are taken. Walk'in and Fahrenheit manage to escape with one of the planes and destroy another, one plane however remains in the hands of the terrorists. The terrorists plan to shoot down a tanker over Paris during the Bastille Day celebrations but Walk'in and Fahrenheit intercept the rogue Mirage and shoot it down over an unpopulated area.
