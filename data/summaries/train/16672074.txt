http://www.shouldireallydoit.com This real-life feature follows the extraordinary life of PETRA, a German woman living in Istanbul, in an ironic inversion of the familiar story of Turkish migrants to Germany. Her life will take such strange turns you’ll think she’s following a script. But really, we’re watching a real life protagonist evolve in the face of life. For, ultimately, nothing is ever as surprising as life. Except, perhaps, fiction! During 'sessions' with the mysterious, masked HEROLD, her life unfolds before our eyes and we will learn about everything: Istanbul, Germany, family, friends, drugs and death. “Should I Really Do It?” plays with these concepts of real life and fiction, documentary and drama... Could life ever be more interesting than fiction?
