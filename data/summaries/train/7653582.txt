David Banner masquerades as David Bellamy, a mentally-challenged janitor, in order to gain access to a scientific research facility. He has determined that the studies of one of the scientists there, Dr. Ronald Pratt , may hold the key to curing his condition. Pratt takes a liking to the man he sees only as a building custodian. Bypassing security, David enters Pratt's laboratory, examines the formula on his blackboard, making corrections and filling in gaps. After Pratt catches him doing this, Banner reveals his true identity and history. Both scientists agree to work together to cure Banner and perfect the formula harnessing gamma radiation believed to give ordinary humans superhuman strength when under periods of stress.
