Tom watches clips of him attempting to catch Jerry, the first clip is "Part Time Pal" where Tom chases Jerry until he is hit in a wall and Jerry then proceeds to eat a corn as Tom drags it and gives chase.

The next clip is from "Nit-Witty Kitty" in the scene where Tom is eating cheese in a plank and Jerry throws a bowling ball in the seesaw and Tom is hit in the ceiling until the ball hits him and Tom pauses this. The next clip is from "Johann Mouse" where Tom slides into the stairs to get Jerry, but he is hit in the window and falls, Tom rewinds this and checks the heights and measurements of the disaster. Jerry comes out of his hole and sees "The Yankee Doodle Mouse" clips, he smiles and drags out a tub of popcorn and brings out a telescope, the next clip is from "Heavenly Puss", in the part when Tom tries to catch Jerry before Tom got hit by a piano.
