Shastri Suri  comes from a middle-class yet honest background. He has raised his son, police inspector Siddhant Suri  and daughter Bindiya  and second son Nandu  in a similar way. But Nandu has fallen into bad company. He is in debt and unable to repay his debt, therefore, he decides to rob, and does so at the house belonging to Pooja , when Pooja confronts him, he attacks her and as a result Pooja loses her sight. A blind Pooja subsequently weds Siddhant, not knowing that her assailant is her brother-in-law. Shastriji's employee Kanhaiyalal  is greedy and ambiguous. When Shastriji stands for election, he is opposed strongly by a corrupt and avarious, Adarsh Vardhan . By hook and crook, Adarsh wins the election, and decides to humiliate the Suri family. He asks that his body-guard be none other Siddhant Suri. Siddhant must now chose to stay with the police force or stay on and serve his corrupt master.
