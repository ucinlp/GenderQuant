Kerry Ellison  has a good job at an office of the Internal Revenue Service. She is happy. All goes well, until Jack Gilcrest  develops an interest in her. He starts stalking her--following her, and writing her sexually tense notes. Kerry makes it clear multiple times that she is not interested in him. Even when Kerry is transferred to another division, Jack's stalking does not diminish. He returns and threatens Kerry so much, she begins to get anxiety attacks. Kerry's bosses dismiss Jack's obsession as harmless, and her labor union refuses to deal with the problem. Kerry files a sexual harassment suit against her employers, who subsequently put her through hell.
