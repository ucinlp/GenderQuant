The Honky Problem opens with Inbred Jed, a very emotional hillbilly and his band  playing a country music concert for a small group of similar white trash citizens. Jed introduces himself, bringing himself to tears explaining how good it is to be there, playing a concert. He performs one of his songs, "Long Legged Woman". After the song is finished, Jed tearfully proclaims how much he loves the song he just played, and performs it again. While the song is being performed, the narrator warns the viewers to check with their local "Mormon"  church before having children. He then claims that "Inbreeding is everybody's problem."
