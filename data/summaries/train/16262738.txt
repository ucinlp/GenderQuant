Though he has safely locked the diamond away, a crooked pair of miners, named Devereaux  and Hoskins, operating the neighboring mine steal the panther's discovery. Devereaux and Hoskins then try to dispose of the Pink Panther, but fail miserably. In conclusion of the last scheme, Devereaux and Hoskins end up turning on each other as the panther takes their largest gem.
