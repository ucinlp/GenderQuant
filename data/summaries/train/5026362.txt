When computer-programmer Simon J.  begins finding empty plain brown paper packages in his apartment, he goes to great length to try and secure his boundaries, but the packages keep appearing. Simon attempts to find out who is leaving the packages, and his investigation exposes him to his eccentric neighbors, an artificial intelligence robot head, created by Derrick  who occupies an apartment across the hall from Simon, a virtual reality sex-game, created by the Neighbour  who occupies the apartment next to Simon's, and the possibility of a corporate conspiracy. At the same time Simon, who works in IT, is under pressure to complete a code and develops a romantic relationship with another of the apartment blocks residents, Trish . With security cameras watching him constantly, Simon begins to lose his grip on reality, and develops an inexplicable craving for Nature Fresh brand milk. Simon becomes increasingly puzzled as murders begin happening in the building. Simon eventually finds out that everyone else is receiving packages too but were keeping quiet. These people also got addicted to consuming other products like fresh juice, cola 500 and farm fresh meat. One of Simon's friends, a courier named Nile , tells Simon about a corporate experiment to ‘infuse’ Nanomites into people's brains to make them addicted to certain products. He first dismisses it as a lie but eventually understands that it is indeed what is happening.
