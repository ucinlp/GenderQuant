George Dupler, a man nearing middle age, is demoted after a temper tantrum and reduced to working as the midnight-shift manager of an all-night pharmacy/convenience store. George advises his adult son Freddie to stop having an affair with an older, married woman before it leads to trouble. But when George finally meets the woman, Cheryl Gibbons, an untalented singer-songwriter married to a volatile firefighter, she begins to show an interest in him. The next thing George knows, it's being announced by Freddie at the family's dinner table that Cheryl and his father have become romantically involved. George ends up moving out of the house, taking a loft and trying to begin a new life as an inventor.
