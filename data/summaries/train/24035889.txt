An actor is killed during the performance of a play while critic Tony Woolrich ([[Dave O'Brien  is attending. Initially Woolrich is reluctant to investigate, even though he's encouraged to by his friend Romeo, who is also the taxi driver who brought him to the show, and acts as a sort of sidekick throughout the story. Later Tony is chewed out by his editor for not investigating when he happened to be at the scene of the crime, and so he takes an initially reluctant interest. Tony becomes more involved in the investigation when there is another murder, and when Claudia Moore , the girl he loves, is suspected, and is also possibly threatened by the killer.  {{Empty section}}
