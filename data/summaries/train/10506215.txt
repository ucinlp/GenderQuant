The film follows 17-year-old Cassandra Mortmain , and the fortunes of her eccentric family, struggling to survive in genteel poverty in a decaying English castle. The characters include: Cassandra's father , a writer who hasn't written anything in the twelve years since the spectacular success of his first novel; her exquisite older sister Rose  who rails against their fate and hopes to marry for money; and their Bohemian stepmother, Topaz , an ex-model still apt to sun-bathe in the nude. The possibility of salvation seems to loom in the form of their wealthy American landlord Simon Cotton  and his brother Neil . Although Simon initially turns her away, Rose is determined to make him fall in love with her and succeeds. A wedding is arranged and Cassandra appears left on the sidelines. But events spiral out of control, and before the summer ends many expectations will have been overturned.
