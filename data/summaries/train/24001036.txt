The film starts in the rural town of ShinshÅ« in 1923. A widow, Tsune  Nonomiya , works hard at a silk production factory to provide for her only son, Ryosuke. When Ryosuke's teacher Ookubo  persuades her to let her son continue to study beyond elementary school, she decides to support her son's education even until college. Her son promises to become a great man. Thirteen years later, in 1936, O-Tsune, now in her sixties, visits Ryosuke , who is twenty-eight, in Tokyo. She learns that her son, now a night school teacher, has married and even has a one-year-old son. Her daughter-in-law Sugiko is nice and obliging, but Ryosuke's job does not pay much. Ryosuke and O-Tsune visit Ookubo, who is now a father of four and running an eating house selling cutlets. The couple keeps the mother entertained but their money is running out. On a trip to an industrial district one day, Ryosuke confides in the mother that he wishes he had never come to Tokyo, and that he is a disappointment to his mother. He later states that Tokyo is not a place where one can succeed easily. O-Tsune chides her son for giving up, telling him she has nothing now left, neither land nor house, and she only wants him to succeed. Sugiko sells her kimono and raises enough money for the whole family to go out to enjoy themselves. However Tomibo , a neighbor's son, gets injured by a horse and Ryosuke rushes him to the hospital. There he gives their money to Tomibo's mother for her to foot the hospital bill. O-Tsune sees all this, and later tells Ryosuke he has done her proud for his selfless act. O-Tsune eventually returns to Shinshu, but not before giving the couple some money for her grandson. Ryosuke promises his wife he will obtain a teaching certificate. Back at Shinshu, O-Tsune tells her friend at the factory her son has become a "great man". But as she retires to the back of the factory after work, her face breaks into an expression of deep grief and pain.
