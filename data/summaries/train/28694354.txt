In the Oregon Territory prior to the American Civil War, Chief Mike  has fought the US Army and the white settlers to a standstill. As a result the post commander Major Wallach  is replaced by Major Archer . On the way to the fort, Major Archer's troop of cavalry accompanied by two field guns spot an ambush by Chief Mike's Indians. Major Archer orders one of the guns to fire knocking down a tree and panicking the "braves" who suffer no casualties. On arrival at the Fort, Major Wallach has allowed the use of his barracks to recruit more Irregulars for Stacey Wyatt who accompany the regulars on their military expeditions. As the recruiting involves free alcohol and kisses by women to the volunteers  Major Archer is furious and immediately takes command of the post to reinstall military discipline, retrain the men and plan another expedition. No one is more outraged than Sergeant Major McClain's  daughter Brett  who thinks Archer inhuman. An emissary of Chief Mike comes to arrange a meeting between the new commander to discuss peace but Major Archer initially refuses until orders come for him to negotiate with the Indians. The Major and Chief meet with each respecting each other and arranging a thirty day truce with the Indians and whites not crossing either side of the Rogue River. Wyatt is secretly employed to keep the Indian wars going by a consortium of the territory's business community  who oppose Statehood that would ruin their profits. Wyatt tricks Sgt Major McClain into breaking the treaty by telling him the Indians have attacked a white settlement leading to all but McClain killed after they attack an Indian settlement.
