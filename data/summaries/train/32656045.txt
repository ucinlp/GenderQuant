The movie's plot is similar to that of the play: Dad Rudd  has become a successful father but is very tight with his money and oppresses his sons Dave , Joe  and Dan . The sons eventually stand up to their father and manage to persuade him to give them a wage increase - but he increases their rent by an equal amount. As in the play, there is a serious subplot about Dad's grandchild Betty  who becomes engaged to a corrupt neighbour, Henry Cook , despite the true love of another farmer, Tom Dalley . The climax involves a comic cricket game involving the Rudds.
