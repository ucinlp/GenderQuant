On the eve of a battle in 1918, a new officer, Second Lieutenant Raleigh , joins Captain Stanhope's  company in the British trench lines in France. While the two men knew each other at school, Stanhope loves Raleigh's sister. Raleigh sees a changed man, who after three years at the front, is on the verge of a breakdown and has turned to drink. A fellow officer, Lieutenant Osborne  desperately tries to keep Stanhope from cracking. Osborne and Raleigh are selected to lead a raiding party on the German trenches where many soldiers are killed, including Osborne. Although he resents the younger man, when Raleigh is mortally wounded, the commander faces a desperate time, friendless and grief-stricken, he prepares to face another furious enemy attack.
