Angel  is a troubled teen in Brooklyn, New York, who is homeless after being kicked out by his father. He is—for a while—taken in by a kind-hearted social worker  who has her own problems. He later tries to find support and shelter with friends from his school, and eventually attempting to find a way to get by on his own.
