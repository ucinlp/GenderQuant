Rose Fairy is sailing along the river when she suddenly trips on a rope and falls into the water. The trap is set by the robber Qing Yise, who wants to rob Rose Fairy. Qing Yise steals the Purple Sword from Rose Fairy and plans to sell it. Just then, Zhizun Bao appears and draws the sword by grabbing the scabbard while Qing holds it by the handle. Rose Fairy regains consciousness and thought that it was Qing Yise who unsheathed the sword. Since she has made a promise to marry the person who draws out the sword, she follows Qing Yise wherever he goes, leading to a cat-and-mouse chase between the two of them. They run into Master Bodhi and his assistant, who are chasing after Bull Demon King for the Pandora's Box. By accident, Qing Yise recites a chant and activates the box, causing him to be transported back in time to the Three Kingdoms period. He finds himself as Zhao Yun, in the period preceding the Battle of Red Cliffs, when the real Zhao Yun was tasked with rescuing the only son of Liu Bei. While the rescue itself is successful, Qing unwittingly brings the infant Liu Shan straight into the Wei encampment and right before Cao Cao, who imprisons Qing and confiscates the Pandora's Box. Unable to return to his own time, Qing is forced to work with the Rose Fairy, who infiltrates the Wei camp in the guise of a foreign envoy, and the two make their escape amidst the chaos of the battle for Red Cliff.
