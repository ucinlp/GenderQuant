Sonny Corpus , an inhabitant the slums of Manila, frequently hangs out with his friends Celso, Jimmy, and Rodel. Everything changes when Sonny gets involved with a robbery perpetrated by his friends. During the robbery, Jimmy and Rodel are killed, along with an old lady. Although he was not responsible for the deaths, Sonny is convicted and is sentenced to death row. After a harsh introduction to prison life, and unable to cope with decision of the court, he quickly finds his place among the convicts. Mio, a fellow inmate who holds a certain amount of power within the prison hierarchy, attempts to recruit Sonny as a dealer for his cocaine smuggling business, and Sonny hesitantly accepts. Mio's second-in-command, Gabino, attempts to win Sonny's support for a coup he's quietly planning. But when Sonny decides to stand by Mio, Gabino exacts revenge by severely beating Sonny. Later, Sonny is taken in by an inmate named Lolo Sinat , an old gangster who seems to be the most powerful and senior inmate on death row.
