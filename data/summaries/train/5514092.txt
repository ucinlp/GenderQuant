Set at the court of the harsh Mughhal Emperor Jehangir , the film tells two separate love stories: the first of Mangal Singh  and Kanwar  amid the violent feud raging between their families, and the second, the famous one of Jehangir and Nurjehan . Mangal kills the brother and father of his lover. His father, the loyal Rajput chieftain Sangram Singh , captures his son and Jehangir passes the death sentence. Jehangir's claim that the law knows no class distinction is put on the test when a washerwoman  accuses Queen Nurjehan of having inadvertently killed her husband during a hunt. Jehangir offers his own life but the washerwoman magnanimously forgives him.
