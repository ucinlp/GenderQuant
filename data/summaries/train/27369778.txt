Will Kane returns to the town of Hadleyville  which is in the hands of a corrupt marshal and his two aides. J.D. Ward, the man that replaced Kane as marshal, is a tyrant who shoots up the horses Will has just purchased. Ward is after Ben Irons and his men because of wanted posters, even though Ward knows they are innocent. Ben gets away. Ward pursues him. Kane decides to help Ben. Ben dies from a gunshot wound. Ward is going to arrest Kane for helping Ben, but the town rallies together and issues a warrant for Ward's arrest. Miracle-like, Kane again puts on the tin star  and shoots Ward to death.
