This is the story of an elderly couple that had worked all their life making a modest living out of selling cakes. Everthing they had they gave to their three children so they could have a better future. Thanks to their sacrifice, two of them were able to study abroad and now because of the social status they had accomplished, were too ashamed of their parents and denied knowing them. The third child, had become an alcoholic and his whereabouts were unknown to his parents.http://www.tvcnetworks.mx/blog-cinemexicano/?p=763/
