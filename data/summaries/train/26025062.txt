A film crew travels to a remote island to film a MTV. The island is inhabited by some villagers and a police inspector. Paranormal events occur during their stay: eerie screams are heard at night but the villagers dismiss them as wolves' howling; a strange young man is seen wandering around, asking whether they had seen someone called Ying. In addition, while shooting a scene in the water, the actresses felt something tickling their feet. An old woman narrates a tragic story about a pair of lovers from the village who were separated from each other because the woman's father opposed the relationship - the man was burned to death while the woman drowned herself at sea. A mysterious feral child is revealed to be the one responsible for making the screams, and the old woman recognises him as the lovers' long lost son. A ritual is performed to put the lovers' spirits to rest and their son is adopted by the villagers.
