Candy Rain is a romantic drama which combines four intimate, lyrical tales exploring the range of women loving women in contemporary Taiwan. In the first episode, a young girl escapes a broken love for the uncertainties of friendship  in Taipei. In the second, another girl, seeking her ideal, finds herself involved with a wealthy woman instead. Yet another story follows a heroine trying to find a balance between marriage and separation from her true love. The final story takes us into a dynamic and difficult foursome anchored by singer-actress Karena Lam. A rich, bittersweet spectrum of love and loss, based on true stories.
