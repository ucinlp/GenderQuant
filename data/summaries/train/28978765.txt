Güven works at an accounting firm and leads an ordinary life. He is happily married and has a daughter that he loves more than anything. He boasts endlessly to his colleagues about his daughter’s achievements. His daughter is equally devoted to him, calling him every day when she gets home from school. After an ordinary day at work, Güven leaves his office, takes the bus. He walks on his empty street, comes home to his three-storey apartment building. He enters his apartment, changes his clothes, washes his face, and sits down on the sofa in the living room. The living room is empty. The house is empty.
