While discussing a new book idea, a modern-day evangelical Pastor, Dan Day , accidentally shoots atheist Dr. Paul Blaylock  in the head. Pastor Day tries to make it look like a suicide, fearing the damage to his reputation if word were to get out. However, reborn church-goer and ex-deadhead Carl  witnesses the act. Carl has to endure attacks by fellow church-goers at Day's request , his own family's skepticism about his story, and a Mexican crime lord who kidnaps him looking to blackmail both Carl and Pastor Day with footage of the accident.
