After a sexual encounter with a married woman in an alley in Manchester turns into a rape, Johnny  steals a car and flees for Dalston, "a scrawny, unpretentious area" in the east of London, to seek refuge with his former girlfriend, fellow Mancunian Louise . Intelligent, educated and eloquent, Johnny is also deeply embittered and egotistical: he will fight and provoke anyone he meets in order to prove his superiority. His behaviour is reckless, self-destructive and at times even sadistic; he seduces Louise's flatmate, Sophie , simply because he can, but soon gets tired of her and embarks on an extended latter-day odyssey among the destitute and despairing of the United Kingdom's capital city. During his encounters in London's seedy underbelly, Johnny expounds his world-view  at long and lyrical length to anyone who will listen, whether Archie, a Scottish boy yelling "Maggie!" at the top of his voice he comes across in Brewer Street, or Brian, a security guard of acres of empty space, a 'post-Modernist gas chamber', "whom Johnny marks down as indeed possessing the most tedious job in the world."Coveney, p.25 All the while, the sinister presence of his ex-girlfriend's psychopathic landlord, Jeremy , lurks in the background. Johnny eventually suffers horribly at the hands of thugs in the most casual manner; and when the primary tenant of the flat  returns from a trip overseas, Johnny is compelled to leave, to throw himself back into the world as he has ostensibly done so many times before. It is subtly hinted throughout the movie that Johnny's unusual personality and behaviour could be the result of a variety of  medical conditions, including manic depression and whatever it is that causes him to experience episodic, severe headaches. These conditions are certainly affecting him physically, so much so that one of the characters he meets thinks he is about 40 years old, when he is only 27.
