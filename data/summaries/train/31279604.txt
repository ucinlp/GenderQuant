Vicky  is the son of Halvar , chief of the Viking village of Flake. Halvar is a strong and big warrior who measures the strength of people through muscles. Vicky, on the other hand, is a small but very smart boy who always has to prove his father that ingenuity of a man can meet muscles. One day the village of Flake falls under attack, and all the children – including Vicky’s girlfriend Ylvi  – are kidnapped except for Vicky himself, so Vicky, his father Halvar and the other Vikings of the village decide to go out and try to rescue them.http://www.wickie.film.de/ The kidnappers turn out to be Sven the Terrible and his band of Viking pirates, who are hunting for a legendary treasure, and in order to gain it, they need the assistance of a child who has never spoken a lie in his or her life. Whilst in pursuit, the Flake Vikings pick up a young Chinese girl and an obnoxious bard  for company, and together they succeed in rescuing the children, outsmarting Sven and escaping back to Flake with the treasure .
