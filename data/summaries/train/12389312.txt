Buzz gets himself ready for the date, and beats Woody to Winnie's house. As Buzz and Winnie dance, Woody comes through the door and gets into a fight with Buzz.

Woody and Winnie make it to the sock hop, where they hear a singer sing. Winnie likes the guy's singing, but Woody does not care for it. As Woody and Winnie dance, Buzz shows up and succeeds in disposing of Woody. The buzzard then takes Winnie to a drive-in restaurant to buy her a soda and a banana split for himself. Woody, dressed as a waitress, gives Buzz an explosive banana split. The two begin to fight once again, only to find Winnie riding away with the singer from the sock hop.
