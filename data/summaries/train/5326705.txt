Four episodes  in the relationship of two young women, Reinette, a country girl, and Mirabelle, a Parisian: city girl and country girl. The first is entitled ‘The Blue Hour’ and recounts their meeting. The second centers on a café and a waiter, a difficult man ‘with attitude.’ In the third they interact with and discuss their different views on society’s ‘margins’: beggars, thieves, swindlers. And in the fourth, on a bet, Reinette, an art student, and Mirabelle succeed in selling one of Reinette’s paintings to an art dealer while Reinette pretends to be mute and Mirabelle, who effects not to know her, does all the talking.
