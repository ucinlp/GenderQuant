Partibhan plays the role of Jeevan who is a tempo driver. Soundarya plays a classical singer whom Partibhan loves, but is destined to marry Meena who in the film is a Telugu girl and speaks a mixture of Telugu & Tamil, and is a devoted fan of Telugu superstar Chiranjeevi. The relationship between the man and the two women in his life is the crux of the story. He has done justice to the role of Jeevan. Meena is loud and she has carried the role with ease. Soundarya is dignified. Jeevan  is a socially conscious youth who wants to clean up the society. His motivation is his late father  who was murdered as he tried to be a crusader. Jeevan is intelligent enough to realize that he is not a one-man-army to fight the evils and corruption in the society. So what he does is to motivate the public to fight for their rights. He lives in a small place with four friends and together they do what little they can to improve the condition around. A carnatic singer Dikshanya  has a silent admiration for Jeevan, but it is Meena Kumari  who wins him over and forces him to marriage by telling a lie that she has cancer. There are about 18 villains, who make their entry and exit but finally Jeevan brings them all together in the climax where he gives a long lecture and transform them into being good citizens. The climax scene has the hero confronting all the villains. Says Partibhan, Each of these villains gets a chance to support his stand and speak on the circumstances which forced him to take to crime.
