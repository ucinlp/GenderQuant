Test pilot John Mitchell  disappoints his wife Mary  by refusing to increase their unsuccessful bid for a house. What she does not know is that the aircraft manufacturing company he works for is in desperate financial straits. Owner Reginald Conway  needs to get Ashmore  to place an order soon or the firm will go bankrupt. Mitchell takes the only prototype of a new airplane for a flight, with Ashmore and several others aboard. During testing, one engine catches on fire. Ashmore and the others safely parachute to safety. Then, despite Conway's order and the urgings of others, Mitchell decides to try to land the plane rather than crashing it into the sea. However, he has to fly back and forth for half an hour to use up the fuel. During the tense wait, co-worker Mrs. Snowden  takes it upon herself to notify Mitchell's wife. Mary goes to the airfield and watches as her husband manages to land safely. Later, at home, she demands to know why he risked his life when everyone told him to bail out. He explains that it was his duty and the company's fate hung in the balance. Then he phones their real estate agent and agrees to the seller's price.
