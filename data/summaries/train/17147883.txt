At the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob discovers that Patrick has a famous relative named Patrick Revere who warned Bikini Bottom that man-eating mollusks are coming. Too bad no one listened to him. Mr. Krabs told the two of his great-grandpappy Krabs, who invented a painful security invention that hurts the fingers of anyone who touches the booby trapped dollar bill. While walking, SpongeBob runs into Sandy who revealed that she has a relative named Rosie Cheeks was the first squirrel to discover oil in Texas. Feeling sorry for SpongeBob, Sandy takes him to the library to "dig around his family tree". SpongeBob learns that he the great-great-great grandson of a Western hero, Sheriff SpongeBuck SquarePants. Sandy tells SpongeBob the story of SpongeBuck SquarePants. SpongeBuck arrived to a town named Dead Eye Gulch and goes to a theater/saloon named Krusty Kantina. SpongeBuck got to be a Sheriff by William Krabs . But then a villain Dead Eye Plankton arrived there and SpongeBuck had to face him at high noon . SpongeBuck got kicked away and Pecos Patrick Star  met him. SpongeBuck got a nickname for him and it was Idiot Friend. Pecos Patrick told him to defeat Dead Eye Plankton by smacking him several times. When they got back to town  SpongeBuck met Dead Eye Plankton and the two walked towards each other as though it was a Western duel. But he stepped on him. Like that, Dead Eye was defeated. Then, all the residents of Bikini Gulch built a golden statue of SpongeBuck . SpongeBob soon realizes that the statue is really covered in jellyfish poop, hence the statue's different look. He cleans it up, which disgusts Sandy. After that, SpongeBob and Sandy walk away, while SpongeBob is saying that maybe someday people will know the name SpongeBob SquarePants. Then, in the epilogue SpongeBuck and Pecos Patrick sang a song called "Idiot Friends".
