 Ludovic Cruchot , a gendarme in a small French village, has been re-assigned to the seaside commune of Saint-Tropez under the orders of command sergeant major Gerber . Soon, the gendarmes find themselves confronted with a major problem: a group of persistent nudists. Cruchot manages to hatch a master plan and succeeds in getting the nude swimmers arrested. Later, Cruchot discovers that his daughter and her boyfriend have stolen and crashed an expensive Mustang sports car into a ditch. Unbeknownst to any of them, the car belongs to a gang of robbers who have stolen a Rembrandt painting, which is still in the trunk. Cruchot manages to get the car out, but realizes that the objects he threw out of the car to fix a puncture, including the painting, are valuable items.  The man who pretends to own the painting then kidnaps Cruchot. Finally, Cruchot's daughter and her friends knock out the group that kidnapped her father, and the painting is returned to its rightful owner.
