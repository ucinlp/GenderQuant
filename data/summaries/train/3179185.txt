Tripp  is a lawyer who becomes the focus of an intensive IRS investigation. He and his 12-year-old son Derek , who loves playing Little League baseball, run from the investigation. They assume new identities, with Tripp becoming Glen Simon Ryan and Derek becoming Michael "Mickey" Jacob Ryan. Derek's new identity makes him a year younger, which enables him to play another year in the Little League. His team plays very well, receiving attention from TV and newspapers, increasing the chances of his father being caught by the IRS. "Mickey"'s team reaches the Little League World Series final game as the U.S. representative against a team from Cuba, the International finalist. During the game, LLWS officials receive information of ineligible players on both the Cuban and U.S. teams. It is found that the Cuban team, which is supposed to be strictly from Havana, is made up of All Star players from various island teams. At a news conference, Tripp/Glen reveals the truth about Derek/Mickey. The LLWS commissioner announces that the team from Rockport, Michigan, will play a Canadian team for the championship instead. After a year in prison, Tripp is released, and in the final scene he throws a baseball to Derek that hits the windshield of his girlfriend's car.
