Set in 1990 amidst the First Gulf War, Towelhead tells the coming-of-age story of a 13-year-old Lebanese American girl named Jasira . She first lives with her mother in Syracuse, New York, but when her mother's live-in boyfriend helps Jasira shave her pubic hair, her mother sends Jasira to live with her old-fashioned and domineering Lebanese father Rifat  in suburban Houston, Texas. There, Jasira experiences a sexual awakening, sparked in part by the adult magazines she finds when baby-sitting the next-door neighbor boy Zach Vuoso . Jasira is alienated from her father: he is strict and does not allow her to use tampons; also he prefers spending time with his new girlfriend rather than with her. She has mixed feelings about Zach's father Mr. Vuoso . She prefers her classmate Thomas Bradley , who is sexually interested in her, but does not act without permission. She then goes on to be sexually active with him. Nevertheless she accepts when Mr. Vuoso, pretending he has to go to Iraq the next morning, asks to have sex with her. A female neighbor, Melina , offers Jasira her house as a refuge, and Jasira hides there when her father beats her upon finding out that she had an adult magazine, given to her by Vuoso. Eventually, she tells her father and the neighbors about having sex with Mr. Vuoso, and he is arrested for rape.
