This in-name-only sequel to the first Meatballs summer camp movie sets us at Camp Sasquatch and revolves around two main plots. The owner of Sasquatch, Giddy, tries to keep his camp open after Hershey, the owner of Camp Patton located just across the lake, wants to buy the entire lake area for Camp Patton. Giddy suggests settling the issue with the traditional end-of-the-summer boxing match over rights to the lake. A tough, inner city punk named Flash is at Camp Sasquatch for community service as a counselor-in-training. Flash is recruited to box in order to save Sasquatch. The second main subplot involves Cheryl. She is a naive teen whom Flash sets his sights on. Cheryl's teenage girl co-campers arrange for Cheryl to see a man naked after she confesses she's never seen a "pinky." Also in the movie, an alien is also staying at the camp for the summer.
