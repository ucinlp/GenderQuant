Sach buys a magic lamp containing a Genie. A group of gangsters see the boys using the lamp and steal it. However, the boys had made a wish that only the Slip and Sach could request wishes from the Genie so he is unable to grant the gangsters wishes. The gangsters decide that if the two of them were dead then the Genie would have no choice but to obey their commands. The Genie has taken a liking to the boys and helps them escape, but they are transported back to Baghdad where the true master of the lamp resides, leaving Slip and Sach without any more wishes. The Genie, feeling sorry for them, grants them one more wish, which Sach uses to "wish I had the nerve to sock him  in the chin", which the Genie grants.
