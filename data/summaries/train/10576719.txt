There exists a sleeper cell operating in modern-day Los Angeles; this sleeper cell happens to be from an alien world. The members of the sleeper cell are nothing like average human beings, although they appear indistinguishable to us. They are emotionless and follow orders without question. They are unaware of their true mission on Earth. Human emotions affect the aliens like a virus. The cell has an Enforcer , in charge of investigating agents who are contaminated by emotion. The enforcer is a recent arrival to the planet, and he struggles to understand human ways. When cell agent Adam Bridges betrays his own kind because of his love for a human woman, Cain must hunt him down. In the process, Cain begins to wonder about the purpose of his cell's mission on Earth. Ezekial Smits is the cell's Assimilator, a kind of bureaucratic shrink who orients new arrivals to Earth, and monitors their progress. He also reports anyone that he decides to be "unstable." He himself has a secret addiction.Shows A-Z - them on fox | TheFutonCritic.com
