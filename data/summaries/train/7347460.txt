Beautiful high society type Doris Worthington is entertaining guests on her yacht in the Pacific when it hits a reef and sinks. She makes her way to an island with the help of singing sailor Stephen Jones. Her friend Edith, Uncle Hubert, and Princes Michael and Alexander make it to the same island but all prove to be useless in the art of survival. The sailor is the only one with the practical knowhow to survive, but Doris and the others snub his leadership offer. That is, they do until he starts a clam bake and wafts the fumes in their starving faces. The group gradually gives in to his leadership, and then the only question is whether Doris will give in to his charms.
