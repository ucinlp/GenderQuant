{{See also}} Hurlyburly is an adaptation of David Rabe's play about the intersecting lives of several Hollywood players and wannabes, whose dysfunctional personal lives are more interesting than anything they're peddling to the studios. Rabe wrote the screenplay for the film, condensing the action of the three-hour plus play into two hours and updated the setting from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s.
