The film is set in Karelia  in 1942 during World War II and was filmed near Ruskeala. Senior Sergeant Vaskov is stationed with a group of young female anti-aircraft gunners in a railway station far from the front line. Vaskov is not used to these gunners' active, playful personalities and therefore clashes with them over daily issues. But Vaskov, being the only man in the village, has to accommodate them in many cases. One day, two German paratroopers appear in the forest nearby. Thinking that they may sabotage military facilities, Vaskov and five of the women attempt to stop the Germans. They pick a perfect defense position, only to find that there are eighteen paratroopers instead of two. Though outgunned and outnumbered, Vaskov decides to hold the Germans for as long as possible. He also sends a soldier back for reinforcements. However, she drowns in the swamp. Vaskov and the remaining four fight the Germans. All four women are killed in action. Vaskov is also seriously wounded and finds the drowned soldier's clothes near the swamp. The desperate Vaskov, armed only with knife, one-rounded Nagant and deactivated hand-grenade, attacks the cabin where the Germans are resting. The Germans are totally surprised and are either killed or captured. Meanwhile, reinforcements find Vaskov before he passes out. Twenty years after the war ends, Vaskov visits the place again with the adopted son of one of the women.
