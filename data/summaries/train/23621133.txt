Freedom Machines studies the concept of diversity through the intimate stories of adults and children with disabilities who are using modern technologies to change their lives. Among them are Susanna who is beginning her college career, 38 year old Floyd Stewart who was paralyzed in mid-life while raising four children; 92 year old Gladys who is determined to overcome a hearing loss; and high school student Latoya Nesmith who dreams of becoming a translator at the United Nations. Fifteen years after passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Freedom Machines is a reflection on the status of life of America's largest minority group: 54 million people with disabilities.  with running times  * Susanna - Growing Up with Technology  * The Movement for Civil Rights  * Bonita - Reaching Beyond Expectations  * Floyd - The Accident of Disability  * Shoshana & Jackie Brand - Breaking Through & Parent Advocacy  * Latoya - Public Education & the Law  * Gladys - Challenging the Limits of Age  * Bonita - Seeking Employment  * Floyd - Independence and Public Policy  * Funding Assistive Technology  * Latoya - A New High School  * Susanna - First Day of College  * Kent Cullers - A Life in Science  * Dean Kamen & Others - Designing An Accessible World  * End Credits   with running times  * Technology for You  * Getting the Technology You Need  * Your Legal Rights  * Designing for Everyone
