Brian and Gale aren't friends in the beginning, in fact they are rivals. Brian, during their season together, was always one-upped by Gale, never being in the spotlight. After their first season, Brian pledges to beat Gale and take his position on the team. During their second season, Gale is still named running back. After he is injured during one of his games and loses hope of ever playing again, Brian resorts to taking charge of his rehabilitation, on the basis that if Gale gives up, and Brian rises to the top, he would have made it only on a chance and not by his own prowess. The two bond during this time, and soon become good friends. Brian is diagnosed with cancer during one of their seasons. The treatments and radiation therapy only do so much, and every time it seems as if everything is getting better, the cancer shows up again, someplace else, and soon Brian dies from the disease. During this time, Gale stays by his side.
