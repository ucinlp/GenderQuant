In the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, three New Yorkers respond to a new tragedy. June Sickles Fiorilli  lost her firefighter son on 9-11 and now lives with her granddaughter Quinn, not far from the very firehouse that her boy called home. Walter Hartwig  is the lieutenant in charge on the night a jumbo jet crashes on final approach into Kennedy Airport, intertwining him to June and music teacher Catrina Hampton , who is awaiting the arrival of her twin sister.
