The film begins with a woman named Sheila who is searching for her sister, who has disappeared in the southeastern jungles of Asia . Sheila  joins up with Mark , and they both encounter many perils while searching for Sheila's sister, Diana. Diana has joined a cult run by a man called Jonas, played by Ivan Rassimov. Jonas physically and sexually abuses his followers and local people alike. In one graphic scene, he rapes Sheila with a dildo covered in snake blood, and decapitates a native. In another, a native widow named Mowara  is ritualistically raped after her late husband's body is burned on a pyre. A group, consisting of Mowara, Mark, Sheila and Diana escapes into the jungle, where Diana & Mowara are caught by a group of cannibals, Diana raped, and then both hacked to death, while Mark and Sheila helplessly watch from the cover of the bushes. They quickly escape back to New York when helicopters sent by the authorities come looking for them. Back in the village, the rest of the cult commits ritual suicide.
