Gowtam  is youngest of three sons of Collector Shambhu Prasad . His wife Chaya Devi is a professor, eldest son  is a doctor, second one  is a businessman, and his daughters-in-law are also in a well-to-do status. But his last son fails to go beyond S.S.C.. Gowtam is more close to his neighbors Dr. Bhanu  and Kondal Rao  than his family. He is not respected in the family and doesn't have a clear goal in life. He also builds a strong friendship with tutor Janaki , who teaches his brother's kids. Though Mr. Prasad ignores his son's small gaffes, he doesn't spare him when he comes to know that Gowtam forged his signature. He throws him out of house. Now homeless, Gowtam is taken by Janaki to her house. There, he starts working as a mechanic repairing vehicles. He gets inspired by the words of Bhanu  and plunges himself into automobile repairing. He invents a carburettor that gives a mileage of 120km per liter and makes his brother as the patentee for his apparatus. He saves his eldest brother from a conspiracy of hospital management and also fixes marriage of his sister with her lover. In spite of doing all good to his family he never lets his father to know about these things as his father always wishes to see his third son as an I.A.S. officer. He strives for that and his love is also not informed of his efforts. Movie ends with sharing his triumph with his father.
