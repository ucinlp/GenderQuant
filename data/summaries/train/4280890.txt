Max Fleming is a grad student who developed a powerful cloning machine for the egotistical Dr. Jonas who steals all the credit and leaves his student to toil in obscurity. One day, Max meets Kate Carson, a young and attractive magazine reporter doing a story on the cloning research at the university. During the interview, Kate accidentally cuts herself, and a few drops of her blood get on one of the cloning samples. Later that night, Max runs a test of the machine, and to his surprise he ends up with a replicant of Kate, which he names Repli-Kate. Repli-Kate is fully adult, but knows absolutely nothing. Max and his roommate Henry thus set out to educate her, but with a male perspective. They want to turn her into the perfect woman: the beer-drinking, sport-loving, sexually aggressive girl of their dreams. However, when Max contemplates the resulting woman, he realizes that the girl of his dream was Kate all along, and not Repli-Kate. Meanwhile, Dr. Jonas learns of the existence of Repli-Kate, and captures both her and the original Kate. He then decides to present the results of the human cloning in front of scientists from all over the world, with the aim of advertising "his" cloning machine. Fortunately, Max and Henry get wind of the plan, and set up a rescue mission. Using a newly created Repli-Jonas, the pair are able to create enough confusion to save Kate and Repli-Kate. In the end, Jonas and Repli-Jonas are sent to a cloning research lab, as test subjects. Max inherits the university's cloning lab, and his cloning chamber brings him great fame and money. Max and Kate fall in love, as do Henry and Repli-Kate. Ultimately, Repli-Jonas manages to escape, and when Felix asks Max about what to do, he replies that Repli-Jonas is too dumb to go anywhere. The last image is Repli-Jonas, who is the new president. His discourse is just the word 'penis'.
