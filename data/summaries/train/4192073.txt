Filmed on a zero-dollar budget, the movies are a pastiche of 1960s blaxploitation films. RuPaul stars as Starbooty, a crime fighting federal agent who disposes of villains while getting entangled in romantic liaisons. At the time, RuPaul was still participating in a type of drag known as genderfuck; as such his appearance generally is of a man with feminine makeup and clothes, but no padding or taping to make the body look female. Outside the canon of the actual films, a sketch on RuPaul's VH1 talk show continued the storyline of the character of Starbooty with a preview for an alleged new film called "Starbooty in: Take That You Honky Bitch". In 2006 RuPaul used his blog to discuss a film he was in the process of making which he called "The Untitled RuPaul Movie". The film was initially titled Starrbooty: Reloaded but ultimately is just called Starrbooty. The film follows similar plot lines from the previous ones, but contains more sexually explicit content. When originally produced, cheaply manufactured video cassettes were passed out on the streets and at clubs. Currently they can be purchased together on one video cassette and DVD at the website of Funtone Records, a trademark established by Jon Witherspoon, the man who paid to produce the films originally.
