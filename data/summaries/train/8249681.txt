Parshuram  is a police official who is very rash and is willing to arrest his own family for the sake of the law. Harish, his brother, is caught in a blue film gang, and Sridevi, a common thief, almost becomes a victim but manages to escape. Because she is a witness, she is later assaulted and becomes blind. How Chiru protects her and how the villains try to take revenge on him form the crux of the story. This movie was remade into Govinda, Karishma Kapoor starring Khuddar.
