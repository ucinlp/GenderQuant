At a grocery store, Dodger steals food and hides it in Eva's backpack but she returns it. On her return home, she discovers he has also stolen golden jewelry and wallets. So she teaches him not to steal. Azro  kidnaps him at a pet shop where Eva had left him while she was at school. He discovers that he does not steal anymore. Angry, he confronts Eva while Amy, Peter, Tom, and his fellow police officers look for her. Dodger saves her and Azro is arrested by Tom. Azro's son Mark tries taking him back but fails. He ends up living with Eva, after she shows her mother that she is responsible and her stepfather discovers that he is not allergic to the fur of monkeys.
