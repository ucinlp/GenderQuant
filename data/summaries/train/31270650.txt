After his wife is killed in a car accident, chef Rob Haley  is left grief-stricken. A bad review causes him to lose customers at his once successful restaurant, so after talking to his friend Gordon Ramsay , Haley relocates to the countryside with his daughter and some loyal members of his staff to turn a local pub into a gastropub. On the opening day of the restaurant, American food critic Kate Templeton  arrives, resulting in an argument with Rob, but the two go on to fall in love. Some of the locals are content with the visitors that the restaurant is bringing to the area, whilst others want it closed down. Kate sees to it that Guy Witherspoon , a renowned food critic, visits the restaurant which results in an excellent report and ongoing success for the restaurant under Haley and Templeton.
