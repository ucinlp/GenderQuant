When a rescue team searching for the lost Baron stumble across the pair, they mistake Pearl for the missing Baron, and take the two of them back to America where they receive a hero's welcome. The phony Baron is invited to speak at Cuddle College, run by Dean Primrose . There he finds a love interest in Zasu Pitts, meets three crazy janitors , and faces exposure as a fraud. The Three Stooges were still working with Healy, shortly before they signed their contract with Columbia Pictures, and practically steal the show.
