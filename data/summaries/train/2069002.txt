Detroit Police Detective and Sergeant Jericho Jackson, known as "Action Jackson", was a Lieutenant in the police force but demoted because of a case he headed involving the son of businessman Peter Dellaplane. After his demotion, "Action Jackson" begins investigating murders of Union members for Dellaplane's company. Dellaplane, it is discovered, is murdering his way to power, hiring assassins to kill unfriendly Union members. Jackson has the help of a mistress of Peter Dellaplane, a singer named Sydney Ash, who is a heroin addict. Jackson is framed for murdering Peter Dellaplane's wife, Patrice, and finds himself on the run from the police. He receives help from Dee, a lively local hairdresser who acts as his informant and finds a way to get to Dellaplane. The showdown leads to Jackson and Dellaplane at the latter's mansion at the party of a Union Leader. Jackson wins the showdown, kills Dellaplane; and is promoted to Lieutenant as a result of this victory. Jackson, after much reluctance throughout the film, starts a relationship with a determined-to-rehabilitate Sydney.
