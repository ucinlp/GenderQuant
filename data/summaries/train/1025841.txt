The plot revolves around a series of couples in Monte Carlo, Monaco. Augie Morosco  is a reformed gambler whose wife Elena Morosco  (playing a similar character to her role in [[Oscar  is concluding a business deal, Neil Schwary  is a gambler looking to strike it big and whose wife Marilyn Schwary  is hoping to buy some designer clothes. Julian Peters ([[Richard Lewis  and Phoebe  met each other in Rome and are attempting to return a dachshund to the wealthy Madam Van Dougan. Madam Van Dougan is found murdered and the interactions between Julian and Phoebe and the other couples begin to look increasingly suspicious, as Inspector Bonnard  needs to unravel the clues. Over the course of the film, Augie returns to gambling, Elena has an affair and Julian sells and repurchases the dog. The film is often described as having "A chaotic screenplay, which results in everyone needing to shout at each other all the time". The plot is fast-moving and often involves frantic wisecracking from all the principal characters. A memorable example is Julian being asked by Bonnard to "look at this man's face" . Julian takes one look at the strangely-featured man and screams. Later, Augie is requested to provide an alibi for the crime which took place "Between one and one-thirty in the morning". His alibi is that he was making love to his wife, and he can be certain because "Her screams of pleasure woke up the street and someone cried out ... 'It's between one and one-thirty in the morning! Give that poor woman a break!{{'"}} Lewis' customary dry humour is ever-present, including his description of himself and Young as "Julian Peters and Phoebe? We sound like a high-wire act!" There are some elements of physical comedy, including the facial expressions of the characters as the contents of a suitcase are revealed. A striking example, however, is Augie's re-enactment of how he crept from room to room of a hotel at night.
