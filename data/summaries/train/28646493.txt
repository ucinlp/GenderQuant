Hasan Hujdur is a 42-year-old Muslim from Bosnia living in America, who finds utopia behind the wheel of his Buick Riviera. Surrounding everything that Hasan loves is a prejudiced world afraid of a culture they cannot understand and a religion they cannot comprehend. Hasan is a quiet man, who stands distant from his beliefs, however it is these beliefs that inevitability lead to his untimely death. On the way to pick up his wife, from work at the Hospital, he falls asleep at the wheel of his Buick and runs it off the road, lodging in the snow. He is discovered by Vuko Salipur, who stops and approaches Hasan and the accident with extreme caution, armed with a gun. They both immediately recognise that they are from the same country and both understand the irony of a Bosnian stopping to help in a country full of all different races and colours. Despite their similar background it soon becomes clear that Muslim Hasan and non-Muslim Vuko are very different. Their continuing interaction results in ever increasing tension between them, ultimately with tragic consequences.
