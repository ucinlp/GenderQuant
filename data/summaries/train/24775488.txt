The film's protagonists are three Pakistani brothers, the older one being a police officer and the younger two, small-time hoodlums. The three brothers ultimately reconcile in the light of the controversy over The Satanic Verses: in a dramatized version of the Islamabad police firing on a mob on February 12, 1990 when five demonstrators were killed and 83 injured, their younger sister is killed by the police while demonstrating against Rushdie. The three brothers decide to avenge her and Islamâ€™s honor by hunting down and killing Rushdie. They receive the help of a female police officer in the course of their mission. Salman Rushdie, played by Afzaal Ahmad, is portrayed in the film as a criminal mastermind, working for an international organization devoted to destroying Islam . He is depicted as hiding in the Philippines, guarded by a private army led by an Israeli general. Saeed Khan Rangeela stars as "Chief Batu Batu", Rushdie's main Jewish henchman. The fictionalized Rushdie routinely amuses himself by torturing and killing the mujahideens who regularly try to hunt him down. He also enjoys torturing Muslims by making them listen to readings of The Satanic Verses.La Vengeance d'Islamabad, Le Nouvel observateur, 26 June 1990
