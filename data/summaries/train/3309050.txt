The story begins in 1942, at the time where Europe was going through one of the worst moments of World War II. The Germans are throughout Europe and the Gestapo is the instrument to eliminate the people that are working in the resistance. When a young resistance worker and medical student, Eli≈°ka, is on the brink of arrest, she is given new identity papers and sent to the country to marry a sawmill worker who has been in the hospital recovering from a near-fatal accident. They must learn to function as man and wife and confront difficulties from the German occupation, the village thug, and, worst of all, the brutal Red Army "liberators."
