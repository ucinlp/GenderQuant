This is an advertising film for Solidox toothpaste. Naunton Wayne, seated in front of a dressing room mirror, removes his theatrical disguise . Other examples of deceptive appearances:- a hotel drunk ; a commissionaire; a dramatic sequence featuring a fraudulent clerk which turns out to be taking place on a film set; a father pretending to cane his son; a bullying sergeant major  who is henpecked at home ; Dorothy Carless steps out of a taxi, enters a dressing room, removes her stockings and emerges as a Cockney comedienne . A young woman displaying perfect white teeth; sometimes such an appearance can be deceptive, but not with this young woman, who cleans her teeth front and back with Solidox toothpaste. SOLIDOX FREES TEETH FROM TARTAR. The End .http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/138062?view=synopsis
