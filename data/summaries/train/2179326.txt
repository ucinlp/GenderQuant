In London, a gang of criminals from Australia led by Jack Coombes  impersonate policemen to carry out robberies. Local gang leader "Pearly" Gates , who operates from the cover of a French couturier, finds his takings cut severely, and blames rival crook "Nervous" O'Toole . When it emerges that they are both being scammed by the same gang, they join forces, along with Lionel Jeffries' Police Inspector "Nosey" Parker, to bring the so-called "I.P.O. mob"  to justice. Nanette Newman provides the love interest, the ubiquitous John Le Mesurier plays a senior policeman, and a young Michael Caine has a small and uncredited role as a young PC. Other uncredited roles include John Junkin , Dennis Price , Cardew Robinson , Dick Emery , Mario Fabrizi , John Harvey , Harold Siddons , Jack Silk , Derek Guyler , Gerald Sim  and Marianne Stone .
