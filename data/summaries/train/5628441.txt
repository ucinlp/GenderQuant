Lamas plays "Soldier" Jack Kelly, a police officer who served in the Marine Special Forces "Snake Eater" team. Soldier uses the talents that he learned in the Snake Eaters to hunt down the criminals who killed his parents and kidnapped his sister. The criminals covered their crime, using a bear costume "The Bear". This fooled authorities for their various murders and arson. They also attempted to rape women over the course of many days of captivity, but always failed. Perhaps the key point of hilarity in the movie, is a tie between a motorcycle transformed into a jet-ski, and someone riding his own motorcycle off some docks to momentarily distract his best customers.
