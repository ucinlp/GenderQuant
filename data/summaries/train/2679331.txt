A strange disease hits Taiwan just before the turn of the new millennium. Despite evacuation orders, tenants of a rundown apartment building stay put, including shop owner Hsiao-Kang . One day, a plumber arrives at Hsiao-Kang's apartment to check the pipes. He drills a small hole into the floor, which comes down through the ceiling of the woman downstairs . The hole never gets repaired, and this leads to some tension between the two residents.
