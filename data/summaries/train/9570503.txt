The film begins during the late 1960s  at the House of Lords, with Lord Longford, a regular prison visitor, presiding over a reception for a number of ex-convicts whom he had visited and corresponded with when they were incarcerated. He receives a letter from one of the most notorious criminals in Britain, the so-called Moors Murderer Myra Hindley, who is several years into her life sentence for taking part in the murder of three children with her boyfriend, Ian Brady. When he visits her, she asks for books but also for him to arrange for her to meet Brady. Longford is shocked and tells her that it would be in her own best interests to have no contact with Brady, as it might harm any future chances of parole. Hindley seems equally shocked at the idea that she would ever be allowed parole. Longford then begins his campaign for Hindley to be paroled. The question remains of whether Hindley is indeed reformed &mdash; for example, in her decision to convert to Longford's own Roman Catholic faith &mdash; or whether she is merely manipulating him and feigning her rehabilitation in an attempt to bring herself closer to release. Longford visits Brady twice; on both occasions, Brady tells him that she is manipulative and that he should turn his back on her. Longford, driven by his deep religious belief that all people are ultimately good, decides to continue on his course, despite heavy public, political, and family criticism and even though it turns out that Hindley has not been honest with him. In 1986 she reveals that she and Brady were responsible for two further murders. Even as Hindley's revelations sparked yet more public hostility towards Longford for trying to win her release, he remains loyal to Hindley and continues to back her campaign for release. He is last seen visiting her in prison in the late 1990s, by which time Longford is frail and more than 90 years old, while Hindley is still in her 50s but in a declining state of health. As the film ends and just before the credits start to roll, we are informed that Longford died in August 2001, while Hindley never got the parole that she spent a generation fighting for and remained imprisoned until her death in November 2002.
