Short of food, Foghorn Leghorn tries to court with Miss Prissy in hopes of getting food for the winter. While trying to court her, there is a knock on the door. It is a baby basket containing Henery Hawk, posing as an orphan chick in his latest attempt to infiltrate the barnyard and obtain a chicken to eat. Foghorn believes that Henery Hawk is going to be trouble, but Miss Prissy decides she wants to adopt the pseudo-chick as her "son". To make peace with Miss Prissy, he consents to help Henery become a "real" chicken. Several gags then occur as Foghorn tries to teach Henery how to be a chicken , but such attempts are unsuccessful. Eventually Foghorn believes that if Henery is going to be a chicken, then he is going to be a chicken hawk - so he flies after Henery with the intent of catching him. Henery flees to the safety of Miss Prissy, who slams the door on Foghorn for good.
