Cheila is a transsexual who has come back from Canada to spend holidays at the quinta she bought for her mother years ago, seeking family support before undergoing her sexual reassignment surgery. Upon her arrival she finds the once luxurious house completely deteriorated and inhabited by her lazy and unemployed brothers with their wives and children. The financial problems and chaotic situations surrounding her relatives make her reconsider her relationship with them and herself. The movie uses flashbacks to show Cheila's experiences when she was Che√≠to.
