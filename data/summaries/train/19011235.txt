John Emmett is on a fishing trip when his car breaks down. He is offered a ride by a stranger, Ann Nicholson, who is driving to Santa Fe and asks him to take turns behind the wheel. A woman identifying herself as a nurse takes John aside in a diner and says she has been following because Ann is an escaped mental patient of a Dr. Frederick Simmons. And although he isn't sure what to believe, John begins to doubt Ann when two policemen take them into custody, claiming to be investigating a murder in Los Angeles. John and Ann manage to slip away. He demands the truth, whereupon Ann says she is an ex-German citizen who stumbled upon a government plot and is in possession of valuable microfilm. The chase ends in a shootout between Simmons, who is actually a Soviet spy, and his accomplices versus FBI agents, who verify Ann's story. She and John end up married and fishing on their honeymoon.
