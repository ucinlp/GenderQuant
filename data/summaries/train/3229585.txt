A secret government agency hires Jake as a consultant on a project they have been working on.

As the Replicant and Jake work to track Garrotte down, tension is constant. Jake feels that the Replicant could turn on him at any moment, as Garrotte's killer instinct may take over and dictate the Replicant's tendencies. The Replicant tries to understand the world and life. He tries to understand his connection with Garrotte. The replicant also tries to understand why Jake treats him so roughly. As they work together, the Replicant views Jake as either a friend or as family.

They go to the hospital to talk with Garrotte  mother, but she had died of a heart attack the night before. Garrotte wants his "brother" to join him by killing Jake, but he refuses.
