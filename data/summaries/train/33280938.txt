After her car breaks down in the desert, Amanda Lawrence accepts a ride from Jonathan Dartland, a mining engineer, and his friend Hugh Slater, a doctor. Invited to a party at her wealthy mother's, "Dart" claims not to be fond of rich, spoiled women, but he and Amanda fall in love. Amanda's mother is not pleased to hear that Dart's own mother is an Apache Indian, once married to a Boston college professor. Apaches work for Dart in a mine, but women are not welcome and Amanda feels ignored. She spends more time with Hugh, causing gossip in town begun by Maria, who is attracted to the doctor. A pregnant Amanda seeks out Dart's mother, an Apache princess, who explains some of her son's attitudes. Dart angrily believes Amanda to be off with Hugh somewhere, however. When she returns, he is drunk and violent with her, causing a miscarriage. Amanda intends to return home. A collapse of the Foxfire mine injures Dart, but he also finds a rich vein of gold there. Informed that he's been hurt, Amanda rushes back to him.
