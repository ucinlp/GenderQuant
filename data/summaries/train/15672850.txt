"Pearl" is as an ambitious hoyden who rises from amateur-night vaudeville to silent-screen stardom. The major plot line is the romantic relationship she has with Farrington, the hard driving boss  of the vaudevile troop she joins, the film career is a secondary plot line. The film is highly anachronistic with Hutton generally performing in swing style though the action takes places in the teens and early twenties.
