In the mid-90s, in Eastern Bolivia, a powerful and authoritarian sixty-year-old male patriarch leaves a legacy to the women of his life. His secretary Elena, his lover Lola, his wife Olga  and his only daughter Alex are all called unwittingly to the same office to receive their inheritance. Within this room, the stereotypes he has constrained them with gradually to dissolve, as their meeting begins to reveal their pasts to them in a new light. The women are thereby forced to confront their own reasons for being there as well as those of the other women. Finally, the unexpected presence of the man within the room forces them all to abandon the place. Outside of the room we perceive a country in transformation, the chaos and marvel that is Bolivia.
