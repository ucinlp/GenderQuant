The three films follow the same basic plot, where a senior police detective is attached to elucidate the murder of a little girl. As the detective hopes for leads while talking with the mother of the murdered girl, he pledges to find her killer â€“ and so, even after leaving the police force, he embarks upon buying a gasoline shop in the remote area where he hopes to find the criminal, and uses a little girl as bait to attract the killer. His trap is ultimately successful in ensnaring the murderer.
