In the early '70s, an attractive young Parisian student, Marc, tries to organize students to fight for gay rights. Meanwhile, his best friend, Julie, becomes involved in feminist and class causes. Sparks fly when these disparate groups unite in opposition to the status quo during a heated radio show debate, leading to radical changes… “My Super 8 Season” is freely inspired by the story of the FHAR, the Homosexual Revolutionary Action Front, and dedicated to its leaders Guy Hocquenghem and Françoise d'Eaubonne.
