The story begins in the mind of Cashril Plus,http://www.cashrilplus.co.za/ a twelve-year-old animator and son of graffiti artist Faith47. Through Cashril's eyes, we see his mother paint the streets and forgotten townships haloing Cape Town. Weaving through the lives of Faith47, Warongx ,http://www.myspace.com/warongx Emile Jansen ,http://www.tarahenley.com/2005/11/emile-jansen-and-black-noise.html Sweat.X ,http://sweatx.bandcamp.com// Blaq Pearl http://www.blaqpearl.co.za/ and Mthetho ,http://independentmediachannel.tv/video/36/mthetho-mapoyi-and-siviwe-sije the film culminates in an intertwined story. Born into separate areas of a formerly-segregated South Africa, the artists recraft history -- and the impacts of apartheid -- in their own artistic languages. The lens reveals the impulse behind the artists’ social consciousness, the individuals’ eccentricities, and each creator’s unique form of expression. Diving into the current of subversive art which fuels South Africa’s many clashing and merging cultures, The Creators brings into focus the invisible connections among strangers' disparate lives -- and the creative expression used to traverse the divide. The result is an intimate, refreshing, and deeply revealing portrait of those remolding the legacy of apartheid.http://www.thecreatorsdocumentary.com
