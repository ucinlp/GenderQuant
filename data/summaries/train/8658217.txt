Sujata is a romance between a Brahmin young man, Adheer  and an untouchable woman, Sujata . The movie has Dr. B. R. Ambedkar's fight against untouchability and the myth of Chandalika in hinduism as its subtexts on the basis of which it tries to criticize the practice of untouchability in India.

The doctors tell the family that in order to save Charu, they need blood of a rare group. Only Sujata's blood matches, and she willingly donates blood. When Upen's wife knows that her life was saved by Sujata, she realizes her mistakes and accepts her as her daughter. Sujata and Adheer are finally married.
