Fort Bravo is a Union prison camp run by a strict Captain Roper . A pretty woman named Carla Forester  shows up to help free the prisoners, especially Confederate Captain John Marsh . Roper falls in love with her , so he has an additional motive to recapture the escapees. He does just that, but on the way back to the fort, they are attacked by fierce Mescalero Indians who are hostile to both sides and trapped in a shallow exposed depression. Roper frees and arms his prisoners, but even then, it looks like the Indians will wipe them out. One by one, they are killed. The next morning, to try to save Carla, Roper makes it look like he is the only one left alive and walks out in plain view. He is wounded, but the cavalry comes to the rescue just in time.
