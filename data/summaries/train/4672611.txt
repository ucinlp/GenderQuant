After a bike accident, sweet but nerdy 15-year old Louise Miller  knocks on the door of a strange looking house, hoping to use the phone. Instead she finds a strange but welcoming woman, the seer Madame Serena , who is stunned to realize that Louise is a reincarnated witch and an old friend of Serena's. On Louise's 16th birthday, her magical powers return to her through a powerful amulet she lost in a former life. Now that Louise has the power to make her dreams come true, she casts a popularity spell to win the hottest guy in school, Brad , without earning his love. Louise then becomes the most popular girl in school while getting back at her harassing English teacher, Mr. Weaver, and the cheerleaders who never respected her. After her popularity spell gets out of hand, and realizing that believing in yourself is the true magic, Louise gives up her power to make her own happy ending.
