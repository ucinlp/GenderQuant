Jack Lemmon stars as the playboy landlord Mr. Hogan, a swinging bachelor. Women are mere playthings to him, plus he's a master con man. His bachelor pad is a holy temple of seduction: blood-red walls, African sculptures, a well-stocked cocktail bar, and a switch-operated fireplace. He walks around wearing a scarlet blazer  and a devilish smirk. As the landlord of a Californian apartment block, he only rents rooms to gorgeous single women at just $75 a month. The film begins as Irene Wilson , a recently divorced tenant, has just concluded her relationship with Hogan. She's moving out of her apartment, which is immediately snapped up by her na√Øve niece, Robin Austin . Hogan is thrilled at the prospect of yet another beautiful tenant to seduce, but is initially unaware that Robin's short-tempered, eternally-frustrated, bumbling boyfriend David  will also be moving in. The temptation is naturally there, but Hogan does his best to prevent David and Robin from consummating their relationship. Irene, who has only lately come to realise the extent of Hogan's promiscuity, is determined to prevent him from getting his hands on her niece. Irene confronts him at his barber, and Hogan is self-defensive and self-deluded to comic effect. Murphy  and Dorkus  are two servants who work for Hogan. They are also married; much to Murphy's unhappiness.
