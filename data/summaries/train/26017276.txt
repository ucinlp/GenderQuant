In the future. At Moon City, fate brings three adventurers together: a space ship owner, a young prospector and a shady entrepreneur who are heading for gold on an asteroid. There they find a mine. After the prospector had returned to Moon City to get water, he is followed by two soldiers of fortune, a man and a woman. The two join the three adventures. Frictions occur because the gold rush gives the entrepreneur a bad temper; the prospector and the woman get romantically involved; a monster attacks; and bandits visit the place. The movie ends with the death of the bandits and the entrepreneur, while the space ship owner, the prospector and the woman are going for new adventures searching for gold. The story is loosely based on The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.{{cn}}
