At the beginning of the cartoon, an anthropomorphic dog, who also appeared in The Goofy Gophers and Two Gophers from Texas  is tired of appearing in cartoons and goes home to study the works of Shakespeare. Upon arriving back home, the dog finds that his home has been invaded by gophers. Unfazed, the dog then begins reading Hamlet. Upon discovering the gophers sleeping in the book, he furiously throws the book out the window. The Goofy Gophers then decide to get their revenge on the dog by literally interpreting lines from Shakespeare's works, including "lending him ears", by rolling a curtain up to annoy him, tormenting him with flames , dousing him with "the joy of life" , dumping limburger cheese as the dog utters the "that which we call a rose by any other name" line while holding a rose, imitating the exhumed Yorick in a dance , using magnets on the floor and ceiling to toss and carry the dog around the room , with the coup de gr√¢ce coming about when the Gophers use a horse to kick the dog out of his house and back to the studio, where the dog laments that "parting is such sweet sorrow", returning to the studio where he began the cartoon as the song You Ought to Be in Pictures plays in the background.
