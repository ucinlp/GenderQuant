Two warring planets agree to settle their conflict by each sending a trio of soldiers to Earth for a duel to the death. Disguised as human beings, they can only identify each other by using special visors. Kyle , one of the combatants, befriends and eventually falls in love with Sandy , a woman he meets during his hunt for his enemies. In the end, Kyle is the last survivor, but before he can signal his people that he has won, Sandy shoots him. He discovers that she is not a human being after all. The other side cheated and sent her as well. Though she loves him, her duty to her race won out. Weeping as she watches him die, she asks him what their half-breed children would have been.
