Mary Richards-Cronin returns to New York City after spending four months in Europe following the death of her Congressman husband Steven Cronin in a rock climbing accident. Rhoda Morgenstern-Rousseau also returns to her native New York to make a fresh start as a photographer after living in Paris where she has just recently left and divorced her second husband, Jean-Pierre Rousseau. Now, both single and with college-age daughters — Mary's Rose is a student at New York University and Rhoda's Meredith is pre-med at Barnard College — the old friends face the challenges of motherhood while re-establishing their friendship and new careers in a very difficult time.
