Toby  comes to Cherry Creek Farms to serve as Stable manager for a family in financial and emotional stress. Kelly  is a teenage horse lover who lives on the ranch with her mother, Lindy . Kelly’s father died in an accident, and the stables have had increasing difficulty making a profit since. Toby brings Flicka with him, and Kelly quickly befriends the beautiful horse. Kelly’s former friend, Stephanie, boards her horse at the stables. Stephanie felt slighted by Kelly after Kelly’s father died. She develops a growing dislike of Kelly and increasingly treats her like some lower class servant. When Stephanie’s dressage teammate is injured, Flicka helps Kelly win a spot on the team, much to the chagrin of Stephanie. The jealousy grows even worse when Briggs McBride, the team’s male member, shows more interest in Kelly than Stephanie.
