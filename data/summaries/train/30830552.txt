Cheuk, a mainland Chinese security specialist and martial arts teacher, visits his family in Hong Kong. Shortly after he sends his nephew to school, a former British marine takes the students hostage and plants bombs around the school. The marine, named Charles, is unhappy because his son was taken away by his ex-wife and her new husband, and they are on their way to America. He demands that his son be brought to him in exchange for the hostages. Cheuk agrees to help Charles and he rushes to the airport together with Simna  and a reporter called Hung. After finding the boy, they need to make a dangerous journey back as both the thugs and police are out to get them.
