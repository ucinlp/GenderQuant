Ever since his loved and lovely assistant Velda has gone missing, private detective Mike Hammer has been in a haze of booze. For seven years he hasn't been on a case, but that changes when his longtime pal from the police, Capt. Pat Chambers, asks his assistance on a job. Hammer is needed to talk with Richie Cole, a dying sailor who refuses to speak with anybody else. According to federal agent Art Rickerby, not only has Richie been shot by the same gun recently used to kill a politician, he is actually an undercover fed. The trail leads to Laura Knapp, the late senator's widow. She is beautiful and she is seductive, but Hammer doesn't trust her, even making sure a shotgun that ends up in her hands is rigged to backfire on anybody who pulls the trigger. Laura grabs the gun, and Hammer gets his answer.
