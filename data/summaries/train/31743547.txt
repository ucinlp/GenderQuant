Three very likeable losers fail while they pursue individual goals. Roland Darbont  is an inventor who has designed his own engine. Manu Borelli  on the other hand is a pilot who prepares a spectacular stunt. Both of them are running tests on Darbont's premises when they are joined by Laetitia Weiss , an artist who builds abstract statues from scrap metal. They nourish each others hopes and learn to get along with each other. But then Darbont's test vehicle blows up and nearly kills him. The damage is so grave that he has neither the means nor the will to start all over. Manu Borelli can execute his dangerous stunt but he loses his license as a pilot and it even turns out that he had fallen for a practical joke and won't receive any payment. Laetitia seems to succeed when she gets her art exhibition, still she can't sell a piece. So they decide to undertake altogether an ill-fated endeavour as treasure hunters.
