A little boy on the pier is waiting for his father; while waiting the boy puts on red dance shoes with bows on them and starts to dance around the pier. He is seen by his father and he rushes back and changes shoes quickly, hiding them in a bag before his father comes out disapproving. During the same time in a shoe factory a little boy is being taught of their livelihood as shoemakers and the value of shoes. The boy is uninterested. It then turns to present day where Charlie Price  the young boy now adult from the shoe factory is trying to save the family business. His father has died, leaving the sinking company in his hands. While firing people since the factory is losing funds he fires Lauren  who, before storming out the door, gives him the idea of looking for something to save the factory. Charlie travels to London for ideas, where he sees someone who he thought was a woman getting harassed by drunken hoodlums. Charlie is knocked out and wakes up in a back stage dressing room. In that chance encounter he meets sassy drag queen performer Lola , the alter ego of Simon. Charlie is intrigued by Lola, who points out that shoes are made for women and not for men which is why the heel keeps snapping. Charlie rehires Lauren and they promise to make Lola boots that support a man's weight. While making the boots Charlie sees the possible market of shoes for male transvestites. With the styling eye of Lola, Charlie leads the traditional factory to design and produce shoes for the catwalk in Milan, Italy. However, things go awry as Charlie's girlfriend wants him to sell the company, male employees are unsupportive of the idea, and Charlie is overworking the employees. Still Lola is not afraid to save the day.
