A wild, uncontrollable youth, Hanlan is adopted by a gambler named Bill, who promotes the boy on the sculling circuit for his own monetary gain. Ruthlessly businessman Knox assumes control of Hanlan's career, but when Ned discovers just how ruthless Knox can be, he casts his lot with the first honest man he has met, inventor-speculator Walter. Hanlan's professional success is capped by his marriage to Margaret, Knox's previously unattainable niece.
