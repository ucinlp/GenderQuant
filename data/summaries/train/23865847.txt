Kihachi , an unemployed worker, wanders around the industrial flatlands of Tokyo's Koto district with his two young sons, Zenko  and Masako . He is unable to find a job and has to rely on his sons catching stray dogs to earn reward money for their meals. As days go by, Kihachi and the boys no longer have enough money to stay at an inn for the night. Luckily for him, he encounters an old friend, Otsune , who finds him a job and allows them to stay at her eatery house. Kihachi meets again a fellow impoverished soulmate, a single mother by the name of Otaka  and her young daughter Kimiko . Otaka is looking for a job but cannot find one. Out of compassion he brings them to Otsune's eatery for something to eat. As time goes by a bond develops between Kihachi and Otaka, and he falls for her. His sons too grow fond of the mother and daughter. But Kimiko falls ill because of dysentery and Otaka has no money to foot her hospitalization bills. Out of love and desperation, Kihachi resorts to stealing. He escapes back home, confides in Otsune  and leaves the boys in Otsune's care, while he goes on the run.
