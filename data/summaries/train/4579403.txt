A future post-apocalyptic world is ruled by the good-looking people. A terrorist group of disabled people, who see themselves as mutants, take arms against their oppressors. They plan to rid the world of "beautiful people" and superficiality. They are very inept at what they do and mistrust one another. They assassinate body builders, massacre an aerobics class on live TV and blow up a sperm bank as part of their violent campaign. Led by their chief Ramon Yarritu, they kidnap Patricia, the daughter of wealthy businessman Orujo, in the middle of her wedding. The scene becomes a massacre, but they manage to flee with Patricia as their hostage. They staple Patricia's lips together and escape from the police in their spaceship. Ramon, planning to keep the ransom money for himself, turns the gang members against each other by convincing them there is a traitor. This leads to the deaths of all but one of the terrorists - siamese twin Alex who must drag the dead body of his brother Juan around with him for the rest of the film. They crash on Axturiax, a brutal mining planet inhabited only by crazed, sex-starved miners. Ramon and Patricia, who has developed Stockholm Syndrome, are captured by miners but manage to escape, but not before Patricia is gang-raped. A planned ransom drop by Orujo turns into mayhem, compounded by live TV coverage of the ransom negotiations and leading to an explosive climax.
