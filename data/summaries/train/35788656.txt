Batman, Robin and Nightwing investigate a string of incidents where a mysterious assailant has been taking down numerous crime organizations all over Gotham City. In their findings, they discover that while the thugs were taken down and no cash was stolen in the crime scenes, The Riddler and The Scarecrow have been lethally drugged with a botanical neurotoxin found only in the Far East. Moreover, blood splatters in the crime scenes indicate that the assailant was reckless, not caring about sustaining gunshot wounds during the fights while drugging the villains. Batman concludes that the assailant is Batgirl, who is being manipulated by Poison Ivy; the gunshot wounds she sustained were her failed attempts at breaking the spell. Batman and Robin confront Poison Ivy, who attempts to kill Batman with a lethal dose of the neurotoxin. An injured Batgirl, however, briefly breaks Poison Ivy's spell on her to block the shot as the villainess makes her escape and Nightwing rushes to the scene with the antidote.
