The story begins in Ha Dong, northern Vietnam in 1954 , amidst the crumbling of French colonial rule in Vietnam. Dan and Gu are lovers as well as servants from different households who suffer at the hands of their cruel masters. When Gu's master is assassinated, Dan and Gu flee south, eventually ending up in the central Vietnamese seaside town of Hoi An. Once there, they raise a family, with Dan eventually giving birth to four girls. Though poverty stricken, the family loves and supports each other, though the horrors of the encroaching war threaten to tear them apart. The story emphasizes the importance of a white silk áo dài that Gu had given to Dan as a wedding gift before they had fled south, with promises of a proper marriage someday in the future. Years later in Hoi An, Dan must sacrifice this one valued possession  to support her family and provide for her daughters the áo dài required to attend school. The film is ultimately a tribute to the strength and heart of the Vietnamese woman, as symbolized through the áo dài.
