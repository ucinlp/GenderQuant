Set on the backdrop of Australia, the film opens with an angry Ram , who just broke up with his girlfriend, narrating the story of his love life to a police officer, Abhishek Verma  as he defaces a graffiti of his lover while her father  listens. Ram is introduced to be an youngster who loves graffiti and doesnâ€™t believe in everlasting love. He has gone through 9 loves in his life, and thinks that love between two people eventually dies out. As a person with strong morals, he is honest and wants to love life and live with open mind, open thought and open action with his lover. Jaanu  studies in the same college as Ram. He falls in love with her at first sight and goes onto wooing her. She eventually ends up falling for him, but wants him to promise to love her forever. Ram, of course, nonchalantly dismisses this and explains how he cannot love her forever. This leads to a clash of their ideologies. Ram shows Jaanu how even true love stales after a while and true love cannot stay forever, while Jaanu shows him examples of everlasting love, like her friends and her parents. However he makes it clear that love between two people is never the same as it first is. Abhishek makes Ram tell him why he feels like this, and Ram explains another love in his life, Rooba . He falls in love with her as she visits Hyderabad when Ram is on a foreign exchange project. He follows her to Mumbai and they both fall in love. However as time passes, the couple faces problems and Ram feels himself lying more and more just to make Rooba happy. Unable to take it anymore, he tells her that he cannot continue loving her if he has to lie and sacrifice so much for her. They break up, and through the experience Ram becomes the man he is.
