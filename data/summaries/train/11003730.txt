Shot in a cinema verite style, perhaps because this film about teenage prostitution began as a project while director Rose-Marie Turko was a student at UCLA, the format tends to hit home better than a more artificial approach. Although starting out as a story about how young Ruby Star  was forced into prostitution in order to support herself and her baby, the film quickly dips into the seamier side of life after Ruby meets a pimp nicknamed Easy  and gets involved with a demi-monde of degenerates. MPAA Rating: PG Runtime: 1 hour, 25 minutes Genre: Drama, Teenage Prostitution, Self-Discovery
