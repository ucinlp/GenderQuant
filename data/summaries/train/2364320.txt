Blue collar Johnnie Maher has emigrated from Ireland to The Bronx, where he works as a construction worker by day and parties with his friends at night, gathering at a pub owned by his Uncle Trump to drink and sing or at someone's apartment to play cards and snort cocaine. He also suffers from nightmares from earlier traumatic experiences. Although he has a girlfriend, he explores his sexuality, dons makeup and a feather boa and begins to spend time in Manhattan gay bars catering to S&M/bisexual lifestyles, where he meets a young hustler named Christian, and the two become romantically involved. As his troubles accumulate, he loses his job and his girlfriend, he still has to face his demons and earlier child abuse.
