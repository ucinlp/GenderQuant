 SpongeBob receives a new Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Paddle Ball Set in the mail and decides to take the Dirty Bubble Challenge of hitting the ball 29,998,559,671,349  times in a row. He is totally consumed by the challenge and forgets Gary for ten days. Gary feels neglected and runs away from home. When Patrick arrives, SpongeBob snaps out of it and cannot find Gary. SpongeBob finds a note saying that Gary has left in search of a new owner. Meanwhile, Gary has wandered into a new city. He gets scared by some stray snails who on the outside seem tough, but were only trying to be friendly. A kind old lady discovers Gary and mistakes him for one of her own pets, "Miss Tuftsy". Gary is showered with love and food while SpongeBob goes to work, depressed that Gary has not shown up. Mr. Krabs says, "Any problem you have can be solved with a little hard work", trying to encourage him to work. But SpongeBob misinterprets him, and he takes the day off to look for Gary. He puts up posters and signs everywhere in the hope of finding Gary. Gary, at the old lady's house, has been fed a lot and needs to go to the bathroom. The old lady puts out fresh sheets of paper which were flyers given to her by Patrick, who was helping SpongeBob in his attempts to get Gary to return to him. Upon reading them, Gary realizes that SpongeBob truly loves him and wants him back. He tries to leave, but instead of doing that, he ends up going to the closet, filled with empty snail shells. When the old lady tries to feed him again, Gary finds that the old lady most likely has sinister motives â€” she is possibly trying to fatten him up and then eat him like a pig. He makes his escape, but the old lady chases him out onto the streets. Gary quickly finds the snail that he saw before, which the old lady now mistakes for "Miss Tuftsy", and takes home instead. Elsewhere, SpongeBob gives up on his search for Gary, and is trying to forget about him by taking a walk, but his memories keep coming to mind and upsetting him. He's constantly reminded as the streets are filled with "missing pet"-type posters and signs for Gary. SpongeBob then hears a meow. At first he thinks he is imagining Gary's there, but then he turns around to find Gary is actually at his side, and he is overjoyed to see his beloved pet again. SpongeBob then decides to take Gary home, thinking that he is probably very hungry. But Gary, who has been a bit overfed by the old lady, moans.
