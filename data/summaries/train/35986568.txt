A group of vacationers on a flight when they're caught in the crossfire of a military coup. They manage to leave the resort unharmed, but due to a violent storm, the airplane carrying them to safety goes down in the South Pacific. After days of desperately floating in a life raft, the dozen very diverse survivors spot land in the distance. Exploration of the new and strange surroundings reveals that the island was once a testing site for secret biological weapons research... research that went disastrously awry. Now the monstrous evils that were created in the name of science run rampant, and each day brings challenges as the survivors fight for their lives and for a way to get off the island.
