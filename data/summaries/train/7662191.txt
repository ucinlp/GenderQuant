Boston Blackie  helps the war effort by getting prisoners released on parole to help in a World War II factory. Those chosen have to be "good prisoners" who want to support America's war effort. As usual, there is the proverbial black sheep who immediately returns to crime after his parole. If Boston Blackie is to save this project, he has to capture the criminal and find the stolen loot.
