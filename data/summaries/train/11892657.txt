In Zombie Bloodbath, the U.S. Government builds a subterranean nuclear power plant on top of an ancient Indian burial ground. As radiation brings the deceased natives back to life as zombies and turns everyone at the plant into blood-crazed zombies, a group of teenagers defends the area from imminent attack. Later on, Zombie Bloodbath II: Rage of the Undead and Zombie Bloodbath III: Zombie Armageddon were also contributed and released in a triple pack with all three of the films.
