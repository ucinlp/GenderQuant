In his hometown Oulu, Lepistö meets a man who shows him a map of Lapland, showing an "X" mark at the spot where he claims is gold. Lepistö believes the man and shows the map to his companion Ervasti. Lepistö and Ervasti travel to the Teno River, where they manage to find a couple of grams of gold. They travel back to Oulu to lay official claim on the find site but are told it has already been claimed. Finally a large gold rush to Lapland starts.
