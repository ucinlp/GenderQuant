Financier J.B. Allenbury is determined to file a $2 million libel suit against The Morning Star when the newspaper prints a story claiming his daughter Connie was responsible for the breakup of a marriage. Anxious to save his paper from financial ruin, editor Curtis Farwood enlists the help of business manager Warren Haggerty, who postpones his marriage to Gladys Benton in order to assist his employer. Warren's convoluted scheme involves having reporter Bill Chandler temporarily marry Gladys so he can sue him for alienation of affection when a photograph of Bill and Connie Allenbury surfaces. In order to get the damaging picture, Bill must ingratiate himself with the Allenburys, who are vacationing at the Hotel Del Rey in Mexico. He heads south of the border with Spike Dolan and introduces himself to the Allenburys as a writer who enjoys hunting, which is J.B.'s favorite hobby. As time passes and Bill fails to get himself photographed with Connie, Gladys and Warren become increasingly impatient. Warren suspects Bill has become romantically involved with Connie and flies to Mexico in the hope he can persuade her and her father to drop their lawsuit. When they refuse to comply, Warren telephones Gladys, who arrives at the resort and tells J.B. she is married to Bill. When he reports this news to his daughter, Connie decides to prove him wrong by demading Bill marry her immediately, and the two are wed by a justice of the peace. When Warren and Gladys threaten to expose Bill as a bigamist, Bill announces he has learned her mail-order divorce from Joseph Simpson was not legally binding and she still is married to him, only to learn Gladys was divorced in Reno as well. The Allenburys finally agree to drop their lawsuit and Warren and Gladys realize they are meant to be together.
