A dissatisfied yuppie couple in the IT business, with no kids and a fancy house in a prestige neighbourhood, have a few weeks off before new career challenges. Envious about their friends' exotic holiday destinations, they meet a travel agent at a party, offering them the ultimate experience: a one month vacation under a false identity in Jakom√§ki, a suburban block of flats in Helsinki. Part of the deal is that their credit cards, house, passports, keys and custom automobile are all traded in for a run-down house and four envelopes each with a weekly cash allowance. Acting as an unemployed couple, their street credibility is often questioned by their new neighbours who are more at home with the ways of the concrete jungle. However, they discover after the first week that the second envelope is empty and that the travel agency where they purchase their vacation does not exist.
