In this sequel, the clumsiest comedy heroes of Turkish Cinema are convinced firmly that the rights of Turkey upon the oil supplies of the north Iraq are being ignored. Without further ado, they decide to end this unfairness. The idiotic group succeeds in bringing an Iraqi oil plant under American guard into its control. Guided by their leader Bahattin , the gang members Bubbly Tezcan , Private Kamil , Clumsy Zeki  and Redneck Recep , manage to take the American soldiers as their hostages, and redirect the pipelines to Turkey. The good mannered gang, however, has difficulties in understanding, why this “clearly legal action” not only captures the attention of the local authorities, but also causes a strong international crisis between Turkey and the USA. And the fact that Tezcan falls in love with the American lieutenant Angel, makes the situation by far more complicated.
