Benton Cabot is a man who was born and raised in the city. When he inherits a mountain farm, he soon finds out he is unable to keep an entire farm on himself. Instead, he accepts a job at the neighbour farm from Bije and Si. Bije is in love with the young Emmy and thinks of Benton as a competitor. He humiliates Benton several times in public, which results in Emmy sympathizing him.
