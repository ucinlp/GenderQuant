A naked man  wakes up in a luxury loft, which is a residential building in an unidentified European city, after a particularly wild New Year's Eve party of the year 2000. He finds a naked woman  in his bed, and obviously he does not recognize or remember her. He walked naked through the apartment and discovers a pair of partygoers - two young boys, identical twins , in a sleeping bag, hugging each other. He looks out the window and recognizes a man  and woman  making love in the apartment across the street, while the woman who was sleeping beside him wakes up, and takes a bath. While he looks at what is happening across the street, he falls off the table he was sitting on, and lands on the floor, breaking a glass. This noise wakes up the twins. He goes into the kitchen to throw the pieces og broken glass away, and discovers ants underneath the garbage can. He goes into the bathroom and tells the women in the bath about the plague of ants in the kitchen.
