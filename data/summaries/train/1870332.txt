The new forty-million-dollar “radio powered” ocean liner S.S. Gigantic  is about to race its rival, the slightly smaller S.S. Colossal across the Atlantic from New York’s Pier 97 to Cherbourg in two-and-a-half days, billed as “The Race of the Ages.” Gigantic owner T. Frothingill “T.F.” Bellows  intends to send his nearly identical younger brother S.B.  to sail aboard the Colossal, hoping he will cause trouble and sabotage the rival ship, enabling the Gigantic and his own Bellows Line to win. However S.B., who is held back due to a golf game, ends up flying over the ocean to meet the Colossal en route and mistakenly lands aboard the deck of the Gigantic instead, much to the consternation of Captain Stafford ([[Russell Hicks . Matters are made worse for the Gigantic when S.B.’s outrageously unlucky daughter Martha  is brought onboard, being rescued after surviving the shipwreck of the yacht, Hesperus V. Popular OBC radio emcee Buzz Fielding , who has just been released from “alimony jail” and is broadcasting live from the Gigantic, is trying to juggle his three ex-wives Cleo , Grace , and Joan ; his lukewarm girlfriend Dorothy Wyndham ; and his inept microphone assistant Mike . Buzz does his best throughout the voyage to announce the progress of the race and introduce a series of musical acts for the pleasure of the passengers and OBC’s radio audience. Meanwhile Dorothy is romanced by First Officer  Robert Hayes , just as Buzz and Joan get sentimental about their broken marriage.
