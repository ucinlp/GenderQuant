Since the end of World War II in 1945, the people of Tanna, a remote and isolated island in the south Pacific Ocean, worship an American prophet, John Frum. The islanders believe he is an American pilot that returned to the United States after the end of the world war, and will come back to Tanna with riches and valuable souvenirs from the United States that they call "the cargo". They pray to an American flag, awaiting his return. One man, Isaac the Last One, chief of the "Cargo Cult", claims he is Frum's son. He has formed an army of GIs to celebrate and proclaim the return of the Frum.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1249387/
