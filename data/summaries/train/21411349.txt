As autumn draws to a close, Barney Bear prepares for his long winter's hibernation, but water leaks, a loose shutter, a noisy fire, a teakettle left on, and some stray embers all get in the way and keep him up until spring. After Barney puts a "Do Not Disturb until Spring" sign on his front door, he locks it and sets his alarm to go off at Spring. When he finally heads to bed, he ties up a leaking vine and accidentally bursts his hot water bottle with his weight. The leaky vine he tied up also bursts, pouring water all over him and his window bursts open, thanks to the wind, and blows snow all over him. Barney finally boards the window up, and tries to go to sleep until the fireplace cracks and makes the kettle whistle. Barney removes the kettle, only to have some coal fly up from the fireplace and down his pants from behind and set his rear end on fire. Barney cools his backside down on some snow, but finds he can't get back inside his house because he door gets automatically locked and his window was boarded up from earlier. Barney crashes through his boarded up window and is still insomniac, mainly because of his record player which he destroys in seconds. With Spring closing in, Barney tries counting sheep and finally goes to sleep, only for his alarm clock to go off and looks outside his window to see that Winter is over, and unhappily mutters "Spring!"
