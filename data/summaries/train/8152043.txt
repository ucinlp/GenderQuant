The film opens with narration by Jim Douglas and "memory" clips from the first film. The narration ends saying Herbie is now owned by an arrogant Scotsman named Simon Moore III ([[John Hannah , who abuses and insults Herbie until Herbie comes last in a race, not wanting to obey Simon. Furious, Simon sends Herbie to the junkyard. Meanwhile, Hank Cooper , a mechanic in a small garage, is told to enter a race and persuaded to acquire Herbie. The judges are Donny Shotz , a car enthusiast; Alex , an old flame of Hank's; and Simon. When Herbie and Hank have won the race, Alex questions Hank, and he gives her a ride, wherein Herbie takes them to an isolated road. Meanwhile, Simon finds the engineer who created Herbie: Dr. Gustav Stumpful , and requests a second such car: an evil, black edition, whom Simon names Horace. Hank asks Donny Shotz for a position; but Shotz refuses, whereupon Hank blames Herbie and leaves him. When Herbie searches for Hank, he is cornered by Horace and Rupert in an alley, and destroyed by Horace. Believing Herbie dead, Hank gives him a funeral; but learns from Jim Douglas, Herbie's former owner, that Herbie can be revived if repaired with his own pieces. This being done, Simon proposes a race between Herbie and Horace. During the race, Herbie is cut in two by Horace; but operates both halves simultaneously to win the race. Horace thereafter attempts again to kill Herbie, but instead destroys himself. Simon and his assistant Rupert  are then arrested by the state police. The film ends with Herbie taking Hank and Alex to an unknown place, similar to the ending of the first film.
