The movie stars Gary Cole as Scott Grimes, a man who owns a rising realty business. His wife Sue, played by Mary Page Keller, is pregnant with their first child. So it would seem Scott has everything a man could ever want. Unfortunately, when Sue is giving birth, she ends up passing away due to a pregnancy complication that is almost one-in-a-million in the era of modern medicine. Their daughter, Katie, is saved. Now Scott is left to shoulder the burden of losing his wife so suddenly, plus the burden of being a single father. He hires a few nannies to care for her with no success , and even brings her to work with him to care for her. The stress is overwhelming, but he is dealing with it. However, the breaking point comes when Katie is crying and screaming almost nonstop for about two days, and Scott can't figure out why, going as far as walking out of the room on her saying, "I don't know what you want!" He took her into the hospital the next day to find out she had been suffering from a hernia. After being probed by the doctor on why she wasn't brought in sooner, he confessed he didn't know what to do, going so far as to saying he thought she was just being fussy. The doctor then asked him if he realizes what could've happened to her had he ignored her one more day. A look of fear comes over his face as realization sets in. Afterwards, he considered giving Katie up for adoption. Instead, Sue's parents offered to watch her until he got himself straightened out. Eventually he accepts his role as a father, gets her back and carries on.
