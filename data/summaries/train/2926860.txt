"Bake" Baker  and Sherry  are former dance partners, now separated, with Baker in the Navy and Sherry working as a dance hostess in a San Francisco ballroom, Paradise. Bake visits the ballroom with his Navy buddy "Bilge"  during a period of liberty, reuniting with Sherry while Bilge is initially attracted to Sherry's sister Connie . When Connie begins to talk about marriage, Bilge quickly diverts his attention towards a friend of Sherry's, Iris , a divorced socialite. The sailors return to sea while Connie seeks to raise money to salvage her deceased sea-captain father's sailing ship. When the boys return to San Francisco, Bake attempts to get Sherry a job in a Broadway show, but fails amidst a flurry of mistaken identities and misunderstandings. He redeems himself by staging a benefit show which raises the final seven hundred dollars needed to refurbish the ship. After the concert, Bake and Sherry are offered a show on Broadway which Bake accepts on the proviso that Sherry asks him to marry her.
