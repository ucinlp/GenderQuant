Saccard and Gunderman are rival Paris bankers. Saccard sees an opportunity to rescue his failing bank, Banque Universelle, by financing the solo transatlantic flight of Jacques Hamelin, a pioneering aviator, and then capitalising on his popularity to set up a colonial business project in Guyane. He also hopes to seduce Hamelin's wife Line in his absence. When a rumour circulates that Hamelin has crashed, Saccard exploits the false reports to manipulate shares at the Bourse. Gunderman disapproves of Saccard and his methods, and has secretly bought shares in his bank as a future weapon against him. The Baroness Sandorf, a former lover of Saccard, acts as a spy to assist Gunderman's interests, and more particularly her own. Hamelin's work in Guyane becomes an expensive liability, and his failing eyesight prevents him from keeping adequate control of the accounts. Saccard ensnares the na√Øve Line in mounting debts which compel her to tolerate his attentions. Incited by Sandorf, Line makes a formal complaint about Saccard's financial dealings, which launches an enquiry, and when she discovers how her husband's reputation has been compromised by Saccard she tries to shoot him at a party. Sandorf now restrains her, fearful for her own investments if Saccard were to die. Gunderman sells his shares in Saccard's bank and precipitates its collapse. Saccard is arrested, along with Hamelin who has returned to France. Saccard's duplicity is exposed in court, and through Gunderman's intervention Hamelin is released. Saccard goes to prison, but wastes no time before planning new financial schemes - with the aid of his gaoler.
