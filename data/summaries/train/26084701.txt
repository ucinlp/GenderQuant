An underachiever named Cooper  awakes to find himself nauseous, weak and covered in webbing in the office where he works as an office clerk. As Cooper struggles out of the building, he comes face to face with a grotesque, powerful, angry bug{{mdash}}the first in an infestation of monstrous proportions. As Cooper discovers what is happening, he befriends a ragtag group of survivors including Sara, a feisty and attractive brunette female, a smart Asian, a dumb blond, and a strong black man. Although the situation is dire, Cooper cannot help trying to solve his dating problems while also saving his life. The film ends with Cooper and his fellow survivors turning toward the sound of a large rumbling. The source of this rumbling is not specified as the film then turns to black in a cliffhanger. The rumbling is suggested to be either the insects returning or Army tanks finally arriving to attack the alien infestation.
