He is asked to transport Robin , the Senator's delinquent daughter, to an institution for girls. He asks his aspiring writer roommate T.S.  to come along for the trip. Robin is initially drugged by her father and put unconscious into the back of their car, but as soon as she wakes up she tries everything and anything to escape. Eventually a romance develops between Robin and Paul, and he begins to take her claims of her father's abuse more seriously. Along the way they pick up Missy , a southern belle who has her eye on T.S. They make a detour to locate Robin's estranged mother Blanche , hoping that Robin can live with her. Blanche refuses, clearly out of fear of the repercussions of her powerful ex-husband. Robin eventually ends up in the institution, but her friends devise a ruse to break her free. This is quelched by the unexpected arrival of the senator, but at the last minute Blanche arrives and threatens to expose his dastardly deeds, including the rape of a babysitter. Thus Robin goes to live with her mother, free to explore the romantic possibilities with Paul.
