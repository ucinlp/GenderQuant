Babe  and Kate  are sweethearts. They live in the rather conservative town of Cordeliaville where there are laws which prohibit both romancing and babies. A new mother arrives in Cordeliaville and notices the sign. Rather than leaving town, the mother leaves her baby... at Kate's doorstep. Kate and Babe try to hide the baby which, in turn, gets passed from person to person until it is reunited with the mother.
