An ordinary Prague family, the Lavička's, yearns to have a house in the countryside. They make a deal with the charismatic old Mr Komárek  that they will rent part of his summerhouse and that he will live there until spring, and then move to his son in Slovakia and sell the house to them. As time goes by, however, he does not appear to be preparing for his leave, and while Věra Lavičková tries to get her husband, Oldřich, to remind Mr Komárek about their deal, Oldřich is not up to it and is instead making friends with the good-natured old man.
