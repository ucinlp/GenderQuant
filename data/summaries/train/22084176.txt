Suryanatha Varma  is an educated, unemployed man. His father, Lokanatha Sharma , wants to see his son victorious in life. Things change when he meets Major Mahadevan . It's another mission with Mahadevan and crew, as they deal with international terrorism with a flight being hijacked by hardcore terrorists. Kandahar is about the Kandahar Indian Airlines flight hijack incident which rattled the nation in 1999. Amitabh Bachchan will be seen as the father of a passenger on the ill-fated plane that was hijacked and Mohanlal will play a commando named Major Mahadevan, who is on the mission to rescue the passengers. The 2010 film Kandahar did poorly at the box office, with the climax being cited as one of the reasons. The climax also bears remarkable similarity to the Hollywood action movie "Executive Decision"
