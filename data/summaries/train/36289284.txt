Four cars are caught up in a pile-up on the Gangbyeon Expressway into Seoul one night when a young woman, Im Yeon-yi, seemingly throws herself into the traffic. In the first car are Do Ho-man , whose wife is in a coma in hospital, and his cockily brilliant student son, Ji-yong ; in the second are a gambling-addicted husband, Kim Sang-do , his nagging wife Jang Pal-nyeo  and their young daughter; in the third are two gangsters, Lee Do-yeob  and Park Sang-gil , who will "fix" anything for money; and in the last car are four members of a depression-therapy group - club president Kim Jeong-sang , high-school student Kim Yeo-na , French teacher Lee Sang-hoon  and a mobile phone salesman . They are all taken to Yongsan police station to sort out what happened, and are joined by others brought in for questioning, including restaurant delivery boy Oh Cheol-ju  and a drunk, Lee Jun-sang . Everyone in the room learns that the dead woman set questions for the big-money TV program Quiz Show and that a memory stick in her bag contains the answer to the final question for next month's show. No one has ever succeeded in answering all 30 questions because of the legendary difficulty of the final one: the show's accumulated pot is currently US$10 million. They all hurriedly brush up their general knowledge to apply to take part in the show, and by the night in question the pot has climbed to US$13.5 million. What they don't realize, as the show goes to air live, is that the organizers are running their own private scam, and Lee Do-yeob has decided to "fix" things his own way.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}{{cite web}}
