The film features Bosko working on a construction site with a goat and several small mice . After several minutes of relatively uneventful working , Bosko spots his girlfriend, Honey, working in a nearby office building. After some brief flirtation, Bosko jumps down into Honey's office, pulls out a piece of sheet music, places it in Honey's typewriter, and begins playing the typewriter like a piano . Meanwhile, back at the construction site, the goat eats a steam-powered machine and begins to float upward. Bosko reaches out the window and begins playing the goat like a pipe organ. The goat begins to float away, and as Bosko hangs on for his life, he accidentally grabs onto a set of udders and gets sprayed with milk, distracting him enough to lose his grip and fall onto a set of bricks. Bosko inexplicably divides into six miniature Boskos and begins playing the bricks as a xylophone before he reforms to his usual self and the cartoon irises out.
