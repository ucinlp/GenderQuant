Manuel Pardal, a solitary fisherman who makes his meagre living from the sea, a native poet, is a keen observer of human and social conditions. Like some in Algarve , or others in Alentejo, a flat and dry close region, he is one of the last survivors of the portuguese oral literature. Illiterate, he follows oral tradition common to both regions, consisting in using straight rhyme and free improvisation. So the poet is an artist and an actor. In the film, he plays a new role using new instruments, improvising together with a new partner, the filmmaker. He goes fishing offshore the town where he lives, Quarteira. Solitude and long waiting «on the salted sea» make him think. He thinks a lot. He has become a philosopher. He is now acting for you. Also those waiting for him on the beach, living together with him, his friends, their children will play the game, showing themselves together with Pardal making his exciting show , telling amazing stories, reciting fine verse, asking you serious questions. He also plays portuguese guitar and sings romantic or “frank” fado.Producer's informationArticle at the Portuguese Wikipedia
