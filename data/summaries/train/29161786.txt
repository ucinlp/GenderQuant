Abandoned with a son by her husband years ago, Signora Enrica is notorious in her native Rimini for refusing to allow any men into her house ever since. She rents out rooms to female students, while also working as a tailor and at the market. She decides to make an exception to her age-old rule for Ekin, a Turkish student who comes to her house. Though Ekin doesn’t speak Italian, he falls in love with Valentina, another tenant in the house, and seeks ways of communicating with her. Signora Enrica teaches Ekin Italian, dancing, and the subtleties of Italian cuisine – in other words, everything he needs to know to reach out to Valentina. Signora Enrica’s son Giovanni begins to begrudge his mother for giving a stranger the love she has denied everybody else for years.
