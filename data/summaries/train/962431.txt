The film chronicles the Battle of Midway, a turning point in World War II in the Pacific. The Imperial Japanese Navy had been undefeated until that time and out-numbered the American naval forces by four to one. The film follows two threads, one centered around the Japanese chief strategist Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto , and the other around fictional characters, Captain Matt Garth , an American naval officer who is involved in various phases of the US planning and execution of the battle and Garth's son  is romantically involved with Haruko Sakura , an American-born daughter of Japanese immigrants, who has been interned with her parents. Garth calls in all of his favors with a long-time friend to investigate the charges against the Sakuras , but Captain Garth himself was killed at the end of the battle when his plane crashed. The film starts with the Doolittle raid, and so takes place before the Battle of the Coral Sea . It depicts the creation of a complicated battle plan. Unknown to the Japanese, American signals intelligence has broken the Japanese Naval encryption codes and know ahead of time that the ambush will take place at Midway Island which includes tricking the Japanese into confirming it. American Admiral Chester Nimitz , plays a desperate gamble by sending his last remaining aircraft carriers to Midway before the Japanese to set up his own ambush. Successful in saving Midway, but at a heavy cost, Nimitz reflects that Yamamoto "had everything going for him", asking "were we better than the Japanese, or just luckier?"
