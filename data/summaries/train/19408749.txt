Hoping to attract customers to Spanky's barnyard production of Romeo and Juliet, star performer Alfalfa proposes a "pay as you exit" policy: If the kids like the show, they'll pay the allotted one-cent admission on the way out. Alas, the show is nearly over before it starts when leading lady Darla walks out, complaining that Alfalfa has been eating onions . After stalling for time, Spanky hits upon a replacement for Darla: black youngster Buckwheat , decked out in a glorious blonde wig. However, the ladder on Alfalfa gives way; Buckwheat saves him before he falls. When the ladder gives way again, Alfalfa tells Buckwheat to hold on tight, but the aroma of onions gets to Buckwheat, causing him to let go; Alfalfa then falls into the audience. Upset with performance, the audience leaves. Spanky and Alfalfa decide to eat onions to alleviate their woes.
