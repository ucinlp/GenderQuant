Al Toque de Clarin was partially intended as a showcase for Argentine radio favorites Buono and Strato, Latin America's answer to Abbott & Costello. Based on a French play written by Florencio Chiarello and Francisco Bolla, the film concerns a retired military officer who runs his rural farm like a boot camp. In dire financial straits, the ex-officer hopes that his sister will marry a stranger who has apparently fallen heir to a fortune. What the audience knows that the protagonist doesn't is that the sly stranger doesn't have a peso to his name. The actual heir is a humble farmhand who has loved the sister from afar lo these many years.
