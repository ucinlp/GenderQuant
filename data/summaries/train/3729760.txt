Sometime in the near future the main character, the sociopathic Temmink, beats a passerby to death and ends up in the so called "Arena" - a modern version of the ancient roman Colosseum. In an acrylic glass cage, criminals with a violent past fight each other for life or death like Roman gladiators, albeit with their bare hands in a cagefight without rules. As Temmink survives fight after fight and thus prolongs his stay in the Arena he undergoes changes. For the first time in his life he is capable of loving and makes friendship. In the background a discussion develops in the media and society in general about the ballot  possibly being fixed and about the whole principle of convicted criminals fighting each other to death in front of a crowd.
