Music director Ajay  argues with his wife Sonia  over whether to give birth to their child in a foreign country or in India . Ajay soon learns that his mother  has been burned by a group of Muslim rioters while leaving a church and is in critical condition. In flashback, the struggles his mother had to undergo to raise her children are shown. She was in love with a Hindu film producer Raman Desai  but was not allowed to marry him on account of her Muslim faith. He marries her but does not document or acknowledge their marriage as it was done without any traditional upholdings. The fact that she had children with a Hindu man forces her to hide her faith and live her life as a Christian even in front of her son. After his father's death, Ajay realises his mother is a Muslim. She makes him promise to bury her according to her faith when she dies, for it is only through a proper burial that she will be able to find herself reunited with her lover in heaven. Ajay's mother succumbs to the burns. Sonia learns about her mother-in-law's past life and decides not to leave Ajay. She stands by him and supports his decision to bury his mother. However, Ajay's task is impeded by a fundamentalist leader Subodhbhai  who wanted to make political issue and encourage Hindu youth to kill Muslims. Anand  happens to be a youth leader and Ajay's brother. But when Anand comes to know about Subodhbhai's intentions he stands by his brother's side to bury his mom as per Muslim faith. Her body is buried as she wished, and she reunites with Raman in heaven.
