The film was based on the novels The Case of the Blinded Pilot by Cmdr. Harry A. Burns and James A. Michener's The Forgotten Heroes of Korea and details life aboard the aircraft carrier USS Oriskany. The film's high point is the factually depicted scene where Thayer  talks in a blinded Navy F9F Panther pilot  for a landing.
