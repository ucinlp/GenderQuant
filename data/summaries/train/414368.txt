When Porky finds a golden egg in his henhouse, it was revealed that one of the geese laid it. But, knowing well about what happened to the goose that laid the golden egg , he lies to Porky that Daffy laid it. After finding out about the fame Daffy got for laying the egg, Rocky and his gang hustle him back to their den and demand more output. Daffy tries to stall for time, at one point asking for surroundings that would make him more comfortable. Rocky and his henchmen oblige, but then demand the egg. Daffy tries to stall for time, but is given five minutes to lay his egg or else. The duck tries various ways to escape his predicament, but is stopped at every turn. When time runs out, the gangsters stalk Daffy...only to find he really has laid a golden egg! Daffy is relieved that he met Rocky's demand and will be allowed to go free...until Rocky escorts the duck into a room containing dozens of egg crates and orders him to lay enough to fill them, much to Daffy's despair.
