Achappa ([[Vishnuvardhan  is a soldier from Madikeri who is injured while the Second World War is raging. In the hospital he meets an Army nurse  who is also from Coorg. After the War both get married in Madikeri. Achappa goes back to the Army and his wife lives with her in-laws. She has Achappa's son but she becomes barren after giving birth. The son is named Viraj but Achappa hasn't seen him as he hasn't had a break from the Army. India becomes independent and partitioned. Achappa is stationed on India's border in Rajasthan. Meanwhile Viraj is a couple of years old and Achappa longs to see him. So his wife and son travel to meet him. But then tension breaks between India and Pakistan along the border. Viraj becomes a casualty even before his father gets to see him. Achappa and Suhasini are aggrieved; she becomes an Army nurse again. Despite Suhasini's insistence, Achappa refuses to remarry for the sake of having another child. They remain faithful to each other and live like this as years pass by. Achappa becomes an Army Major, and he trains young army men in the Army institute of Dehradun. One day Achappa's aged parents from Mercara come to live with him. They have been kept in the dark about Viraj's death and so they long to see their grandchild. When they come to know the truth, Achappa's unwell mother can't bear the shock and she dies. Meanwhile the Indo-China War breaks out and Achappa is sent to the border with his troop. Achappa and his troop are captured by the Chinese and tortured. But Achappa remains loyal and doesn't reveal what his Chinese interrogators want. In his troop is a young, promising soldier  whom Achappa treats as his son. They manage to escape into the Indian border but are mortally wounded. Achappa dies there while his protégé dies in the army hospital. Achappa's corpse has a war hero's funeral honoured by the country, but Suhasini loses her sanity.
