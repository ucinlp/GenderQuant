Smitten by the glamor of Mumbai, two friends, Benny  and Babloo  land up in distinctly different jobs - Benny as the bellboy of a five-star hotel and Babloo as a waiter in a ladies service bar. Benny believes his job is better than Babloo's and makes fun of him on many occasions. Benny's pride fades away as they both realize that even though their job may look different on the outside, they're quite similar on the inside. Benny witnesses several criminal activities at the hotel, from drug abuse to political fiascos while Babloo sees the human side of the ladies bar. The truth stares them in the face that five-star hotels are worse than ladies bars.Benny And Babloo PreviewKay Kay Menon And Rajpal Yadav In A New Avtaar
