Freelance Beijing van driver Han Dong  has worked for travel agency boss Ruan Dawei  for over a year. Ruan is always thinking new schemes to make money and keeps delaying Han's wages. When the arrears reaches 98,000 yuan and Ruan refuses to pay, Han kidnaps Ruan's Singaporean girlfriend Xiaoyun , who is hospitalized in Beijing due to tuberculosis. Ruan is certain Han, a simple, meek fellow, does not have the courage to harm his girlfriend and dares him to kill her over the phone, rejecting a ransom. Xiaoyun realizes Ruan is putting her life at stake and plots revenge with Han, who has no real intention of harming her, to extort payment from her boyfriend. As time goes by, Han's caring nature is revealed and Xiaoyun discovers he need the money to support a comatose, hospitalized elder sister. After the police intervenes, Ruan pays up. Han is cleared of all charges since Xiaoyun does not admit to his abduction. Xiaoyun returns to Singapore but reappears miraculously during the 2000 New Year to visit Han, hinting of a future romance between the two.
