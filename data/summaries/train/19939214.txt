Kenny Starfighter  is probably the most hopeless student that the Hero academics of the galaxy has ever had. His parents Benny  and Jenny  are tired of paying for his studies and give him an ultimatum: Graduate or become a hairdresser at the family salon! In a despondent hunt for graduation points, he crash-lands on Earth by mistake. He meets Pontus , a limping and bullied 15-year old with bad eyesight. Pontus has accidentally found a mysterious and luminary power crystal that has given him superpower and the chance to be noticed by the coolest girl in school, Miranda . While Pontus tries to help Kenny escape from becoming a hairdresser, Rutger Oversmart , the most intelligent man in the universe, finds out that the power of the crystal has been absorbed by Pontus. All he just needs to squeeze the power out of Pontus, and then he will become the most powerful man in the universe. When he finds out that a hero from the galaxy is protecting Pontus, he sends one of the most dangerous bounty hunters, Earth, Wind and Fire, to go get him.
