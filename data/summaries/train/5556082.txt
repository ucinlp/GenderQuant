As the story progresses, Pepe is faced with frustrating consequences, with him facing pressure from his sponsors and the wedding of his former girlfriend, Carmen, to his elder brother, Angel, coinciding on the same day of the penultimate stage of the bicycle race. Originally is meant to be a backup racer whose job is to assist his more prominent team-mate to win the race. However he accidentally overhears a conversation in his sponsor's van through his radio com-link which had been negligently left open, in which he finds out, to his shock, that his sponsor intends to fire him after the race. Realizing that he cannot race without a sponsor and that he has nothing left to lose, he disregards his instructions and sets out to win the race for himself.
