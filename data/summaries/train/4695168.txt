A womanizing outlaw, Leon Alastray , who is also an atheist, is pursued by the Mexican military. Given sanctuary by an altruistic priest ([[Sam Jaffe , he is taken to a village terrorized by marauding Indians. When the priest is killed, however, Alastray is mistaken for a priest himself. This he at first denies but, finding the love of a village woman, and encouraged by the persuasive power of a fake miracle, decides to take on the role and thereby organize the villagers against the predatory raids of the Yaqui Indians. Charles Bronson co-stars as Teclo, a half breed leader of marauders who pretends to side with the villagers but is really in league with the Yaqui. When Alastray attempts to make peace with the Yaqui, Teclo intervenes and foments a conflict. Then, just before the central battle of the film, the villagers ask Alastray to hold a mass. At this point he confesses to the villagers that he is not a priest. They nonetheless accept him and together they defeat the Yaqui. The film ends with Alastray fleeing the military again, this time accompanied by the woman he loves.
