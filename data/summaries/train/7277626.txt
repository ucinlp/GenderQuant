Waldemar Daninsky is sentenced to be executed along with Elizabeth Bathory and a number of witches. Since it is nearly impossible to truly kill him, he is left in a kind of living death, with a silver dagger through his heart and an iron mask to keep him from biting. Centuries later, the dagger is removed and Daninsky returns to activity, fighting against a revived Elizabeth Bathory and her demonic manservant. This was Naschy's favorite Hombre Lobo film according to interviews. The film had a much larger budget than previous Naschy werewolf productions.
