A young girl, Patricia Warren, is deeply sad when her father dies. She must leave her house to go to live with her aunt, Elisabeth Ames, who is rich and can afford her education. Unfortunately, Elisabeth is a bad tempered woman and not used to children. The best friend of Patricia is her dog, Banjo, but Elisabeth doesn't like dogs, so it will be very hard for the child to feel at home.
