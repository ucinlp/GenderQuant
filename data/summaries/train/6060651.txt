College chemistry professor David Wilson is caught by his wife in his lab, kissing another woman. Ann Wilson immediately wants a divorce. Dave prevails upon his best friend and Army buddy, Michael Haney, a CBS Television writer, to help him out of this jam. Haney comes up with a scheme in which Wilson lies to his wife that he is not actually a professor at all but an undercover agent for the FBI. Haney's contacts in television even manage to get Wilson an authentic-looking identification card and fake gun. Ann falls for it, but is so impressed with what her husband does for a living that she can't keep quiet about it. Michael is so impressed with Ann's gullibility and patriotic urging of her husband Dave to do more "secret missions" that Michael sets up a date with two blondes with the promise of spending a weekend together with them. The indiscretions cause a number of complications, including some with the real FBI, the CIA and hostile foreign secret agents.
