The story concentrates on a child of mysterious origin called Delia , who is adopted by two attorneys, Gene  and Karen York . At first, all seems normal, but Jo, their nanny with remarkable psychic powers, begins to learn aspects of Delia's personality that become very suspicious. Jo takes her to a fair for other people with psychic powers. All of them sense trouble at Delia's arrival, such as the tarot reader's Devil card and the blind seer's distress when she nears him. When Noah, Jo's friend, takes a picture of Delia and sees very dark colors, which is like her personality, Noah finds out she is evil. When Delia finds out what they're up to, she gets angry and the whole place catches fire. When meditating with Delia to help her discover why Delia is so full of negative energy, Jo finds out who Delia really is, and is pushed out the window by Delia's rottweiler. Increasingly alarmed and suspicious of her adoptive daughter, Karen hires a private investigator to learn the identity of Delia's real parents. What follows is a string of bizarre accidents, resulting in Karen falling into a paranoid state as she fears people are conspiring against her. What's worse, Karen's pregnancy increases her feeling of paranoia around Delia. It is revealed that Delia is the daughter of Damien Thorn, the Antichrist, thus the granddaughter of Satan. After delivering her son Alex, Karen goes to the doctor who knows the truth about Delia and finds out that the Antichrist is not Delia: she is the protector of the antichrist. The antichrist is in fact Delia's twin brother, whose embryo was carried inside Delia and then implanted into Karen by the doctor. Karen kills the doctor then heads home to try to kill Delia and her baby, the 666 symbol shown directly on his palm. At first, the viewer is unable to tell who was shot, as the camera pans out to a view of the house. However, at the end it is shown that Karen has killed herself.
