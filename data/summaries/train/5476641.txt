The plot concerns a wealthy baron , who is so interested in foreign cultures , that he is oblivious that people within his own organization are using him to fund a local mafia. While visiting the country-side the baron is mistaken for a lazy but inventive farmer  who looks exactly like him and the two switch roles by accident. While the reserved baron manages to charm the simple people of the country-side his lookalike cracks down on the corruption within the barons business-monopoly . This eventually leads the mob to attempt to assassinate the baron who then flees to the country-side after learning that he has a doppelganger there as well. The film features many of the trade-marks of Spede's comedies, such as elaborate if somewhat vague settings, gadgetry and stock-characters like the mobsters, the bungling crook  and a butler named James.
