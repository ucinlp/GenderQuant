The film focuses on the stormy relationship between New York City wedding photographer Al Capetti  and his Swedish-born girlfriend and assistant Bea . As the film begins, Bea tells Al how anxious she is to get married and have children of her own. Al, however, resists getting married until he has substantial savings. He buys a movie camera in order to expand his business, but the camera is damaged accidentally. Meanwhile, Al is under pressure from his elderly mother, who he has just committed to a home for the elderly. At one point, his mother runs away to the cemetery where her husband is buried, as one critic later put it, "to see the grave site that awaits her, one stone among a million in that vast necropolis gazing on the city's distant skyline from the shadow of the BQE."
