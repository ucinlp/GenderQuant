Shiva  is a mechanic, a daredevil known for attempting daring acts for the sake of a bet. One such bet takes him to Delhi where he meets a woman who asks him to deliver a letter to her younger sister. This younger sister is Thilothama , who is all set to be engaged to Ranjan , the man of her father's choice. But that doesn't stop Shiva from falling in love with her. Against her better sense, Thilothama too finds herself falling for Shiva.
