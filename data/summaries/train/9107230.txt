Ganesh  is the slum boy who drives an auto to support his family. Bhuvana is the neglected daughter of a rich man and is in search of true love. Bhuvana  is drawn to Ganesh's honesty and good heart. She confesses her love to him but he turns her away saying that a rich girl like her would never be able to live a life of poverty with him. Bhuvana tells him that she will show him she can do it and comes to Ganesh's house with just the clothes on her self. As Bhuvana and Ganesh share a happy love and understanding, life is all roses till a storm disrupts their happiness. Bhuvana meets with an accident and fights for her life. Doctors say nothing but a heart transplant could save her. The hero has neither heart nor money for the operation. Ganesh is unable to bear the thought of a life without Bhuvana. He is so feverish in his thoughts he decides to donate his own heart to her. In a scene Ganesh is seen whispering to her unconscious and bedridden in the hospital that he is one of the few luckiest who sacrifice their heart for their lover. As it's against medical ethics the doctor who treats Bhuvana takes a strong objection to Ganesh fanatic thoughts. But Ganesh is so adamant in his demand that he takes a revolver and thrusts its barrel into his mouth and declares that he is going to kill himself right on, unless doctor is willing to transplant his heart to Bhuvana. With no other option the doctor agrees. Then Ganesh is seen sitting on the bed of the hospital relishing the beautiful moments he spent with Bhuvana and slowly he puts the barrel of the revolver on his head and presses the trigger. This picture is almost a remake of a Hollywood movie : 'John Q': only change is - the son's character is substituted by 'Lady love'.
