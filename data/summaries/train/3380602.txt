The story is a variation of the mistaken identity and impersonation theme made popular by The Prisoner of Zenda and other works. In this film, Wilder plays a former mental patient who is released from hospital but is mistaken for his doppelg√§nger, who happens to be a millionaire. Pryor plays a con man who tries to keep Wilder out of trouble, while taking advantage of the mistaken identity.
