Cattle baron George Washington "G.W." McLintock  is living the single life on his ranch. He is estranged from wife Katherine , who left him two years before, suspecting him of adultery. When he isn't playing chess or breaking his own record for throwing a hat up onto the longhorn-shaped weather vane at the top of his house every time he comes home drunk, McLintock keeps busy with the ranch. He hires attractive widow Louise Warren  as his cook and welcomes both her and her two children into his home, including grown son Dev , who's handy with his fists. McLintock butts heads with a local gadfly, Matt Douglas, and Territorial Governor Cuthbert Humphrey, a sleazy bureaucrat who is looking to discredit McLintock, settle the territory, and remove the local Comanche Indians. Sparks begin to fly as an unexpected turn of events results in brawls, gunfire, an Indian attack&nbsp;... and the return of Mrs. McLintock, who wants custody over their daughter Becky   and a divorce from G.W. Becky comes home from school with her banjo-playing love interest, "Junior" Douglas , but soon falls for Dev, and vice versa. McLintock approves of their engagement, then pursues Katherine through the streets and shops of town until he paddles her backside and gets her back.
