Julien, an aging widower, is a passionate butterfly collector. Elsa, a nine-year-old girl, with her mother, who is a very young woman named Isabelle, just moved into his apartment building. The mother is usually away, leaving her daughter alone for dangerous amounts, and Elsa starts visiting Julien. Julien grudgingly agrees to let her stay after her mother failed to respond to his calls. One day, Julien decides to go to the Vercors plateau in search for a rare butterfly called Isabelle which can live for only 72 hours. Elsa decides to join his adventure, without telling him, and hides in his car. During the search Julien eventually reveals butterfly collecting was a hobby of his son, who then died very young. His son had asked Julien to find the Isabelle butterfly, and so this is why the butterfly was so important to Julien. The story complicates when Elsa's mother reports her daughter kidnapped. The police send out a search party looking for her. Elsa ends up falling into a hole while looking for the butterfly with Julien. Julien has to call the authorities who come to rescue Elsa. However Julien is suspected of kidnapping and is taken into custody for some short time. A young boy named Sebastian helps get Elsa out of the hole, and she is able to go home with her mother. It all ends very happily as Julien is released when they realize that he had never kidnapped Elsa. Isabelle, Elsa's mother, allows her to continue seeing Julien and studying butterflies with him. Both Julien and Elsa benefit greatly from each other's presence.
