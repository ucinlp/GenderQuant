The story revolves around a tribal caste called the Thakar. Nagya is a drummer who has a passion for being a "pure one" . He meets Chindhi, who has abandoned her husband as she considers him useless. They both fall in love and strive hard to be united. Once when Nagya goes to jungle for wood-cutting, a queen honey bee attacks him and one of his eyes is injured. He decides to take revenge. The beehives are located high on a nearby difficult to climb peak {Lingoba}. He decides to cut all the beehives so that the queen-bee runs away. Meanwhile Chindhi becomes pregnant with Nagya, but she still supports his dangerous attempt to climb the peak. Nagya then climbs the peak and cuts the hives. Chindhi is waiting at the base of the peak, but the disturbed honey-bees attack her and she dies in the incident. Nagya, in search of Queen honey-bee, loses his own queen[wife] in the end. This is a classic paradox, where he succeeds {Jait re jait, means WIN-WIN]in his revenge, but loses wife. The film highlights all the traditions of the Thakar tribe.
