Jimmy Rabbitte  aspires to manage the world's greatest band, with only one music in mind: soul. Disgusted with bands in Ireland, he assembles a soul band in the tradition of Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, and Wilson Pickett. Jimmy holds auditions at his parents' house and assembles a group of young musicians. Unlike his idols, Jimmy's band is all white. With the help of Joey "The Lips" Fagan, the veteran musician in the band who has unlikely stories about meeting and working with famous musicians, Jimmy begins to whip the rest of the members into shape - only to have the group fall apart in a clash of egos.
