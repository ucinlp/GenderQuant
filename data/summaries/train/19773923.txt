While playing baseball near the home of wealthy hypochondriac Mr. Morton, the gang inadvertently breaks one of Morton's windows. This mishap coincides with a plan hatched by Morton's wife to get her husband's mind off his imaginary illnesses by adopting some children. Hoping to prove that he would be an unsuitable parent, Morton pretends that he is crazy, the better to scare away the gang and to dissuade Mrs. Morton from her adoption scheme. Instead, the kids prove to Morton that he does not need all his pills and poultices, thereby giving the old man a new lease on life and a better appreciation of children.
