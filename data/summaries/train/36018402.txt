{{More plot}} Drawing inspiration from the romantic classics of yesteryear, Simanaheen is the tale of an eternal search for love told through two relationships in two different eras. Hindu-Muslim relationships don't only experience difficulty during times of partition and terrorism. They exist even today, all around us. Such is the experience of Raiyan and Kavita. Though they live today, Raiyan and Kavita find the same societal pressures around them. Simanaheen is the story of this modern love, the modern barriers to it, and how little has changed since the time of Amar and Suraiya, Simanaheen's pre-partition lovers. It is the story of how we face society and the often-difficult path that stands between us and our love.
