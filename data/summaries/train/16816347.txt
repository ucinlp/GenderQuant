The story is set in rural Karnataka background and shows a bunch of children playing enacting adult life through a game, innocently depicting social dogmas of the prevailing era, such as child marriage, dowry and superstitions. The movie includes two musical scores, "Kanya dhan paraya hai apna" and "Suno suno ektara bole"; the latter filmed on the famous playwright BV Karanth. The movie begins with a bunch of kids running out of School as the school bells rings - the children all gathering under a tree to play the famous Karnataka Rural Game of "Marakoti Aata"  or the tree monkey game. Later on, the children get together, to 'play' the story of life by copying elders what they see through their innocent eyes, even when words like Dowry and Marriage were hardly understood in true sense. They copy adult life, play parents, care for their children, and even "marry off" their children.
