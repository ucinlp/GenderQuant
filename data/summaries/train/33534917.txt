Against the backdrop of metropolitan Seoul's fast-changing nightlife, rich but lonely ladies  flock to an upscale host bar or "room salon"  and pay for the services of strapping, young male hosts. These charming "eye candies," impeccably dressed and styled at a beauty salon, are available in all types â€• funny, good-looking, talented singers or dancers. They pour drinks and entertain with witty lines, croon love songs and even put on little magic shows. This is the male version of "10 peuro" or 10 percent, an actual super luxurious room salon with hostesses who are literally in the "top percentile" of the beauty hierarchy. Seung-woo is the bar's "ace" or most popular host. But having grown up in a wealthy and now bankrupt family, he claims to be different from the others and thinks of the job as just a passing phase leading to something greater in life. Then he meets Ji-won, a client, and the seducer becomes the seduced. But the couple is plagued by mistrust of each other, a result of the trade they both ply. Jae-hyun manages the younger hosts at the bar. He is a veteran parasite who has women opening up their wallets with just a few words. Although Jae-hyun lives with his longtime girlfriend, he shamelessly seduces other women and even brings them home. But maintaining a stylish lifestyle lands him in debt, and he must, as in host parlance, "go into construction" or schematically lure women for cash. As these two young men rake in money at the club amidst excessive partying in all its capitalistic glory, their personal lives become ruined by the day.
