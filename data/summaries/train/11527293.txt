Two comrades and soldiers of the Red Army, Andrei Nekrasov  and Ivan Karyakin  were sent by their regimental commander  on a reconnaissance mission to film the White Army fortifications on the way into Crimea . After filming, the engine on their airplane stalled and they were forced to land in unfriendly territory. As the culmination of a series of misadventures, the friends were going to be executed as spies by their own side. The Colonel appears in time to stop the firing squad. The second part of the film narrates the assault on Perekop and the Red Army invasion of the Crimea. The film also features Vladimir Vysotsky as Brusentsov, a cynical and disillusioned officer in Wrangel's Army. He shot Nekrasov down at the end of the film. Karyakin hums his friend's favorite song - "The bullet whizzed and aha!..". Vysotsky's character shot himself during the evacuation to Constantinople. The film's focus is the friendship between two decidedly different characters. Nekrasov is war-weary while Karyakin is an idealistic and energetic officer.
