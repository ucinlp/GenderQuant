It is a sad story of a Malayali teacher couple that this film narrates. Ravunni Nair and Saraswathi Amma were colleagues teaching in the same school and they married late in life, when the former was 45 and the latter was 40. The great regret of their life is that they are a childless couple. Into their lonely life after retirement from service, walks in Maya, an ex-friends daughter whom Saraswathi Amma had stayed with during her earlier teaching career. She had got admission into a local college and she was in search of a place for boarding and lodging as well as guardians. Maya, motherless for long, brings with her some cheer. The old couple almost adopt her as their daughter and Maya reciprocates. Some time later comes Ravi with whom Maya was in love and who had gone away to the United States. Maya's father Bhadran Nampoothiripadu having disapproved Ravi, Ravunni and Saraswathi Amma bless Ravi and Maya and get them married. But then Ravi has to go back to USA; and he leaves-behind Maya, an expectant mother. A male child is born, but Maya dies at child-birth. The lonely old couple lose a major prop of their lives. They are left with the baby, whom they look after like a grandson. One day, Ravi appears out of the blue to claim his son and now the other prop is also gone, they console each other and re-adjust themselves to live out the remaining years of their lives.
