A group of American Army nurses are captured by Japanese people in April 1942. They are put in a prisoner-of-war camp in Bataan, where they spend three years of their lives. The story focuses on Lt. Margaret Ann "Maggie" Jessup, the head army nurse who survived the camp and testifies against the Japanese in front of the United States Congressional subcommittee years later as a colonel.
