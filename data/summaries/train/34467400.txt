Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy are on a whaling boat in search of whales. Mickey tries to pitch a bucket of water off the ship, but it keeps coming back to him, to his annoyance. Meanwhile, Donald and Goofy spot a whale, but Goofy's efforts to shoot a harpoon at it lands him inside the whale's mouth, so Donald tries to come to his rescue.
