Madison  and her assistant Hockstetter  are astronomers who track near-Earth objects in space. They are not taken seriously by the scientific community. When they locate and track a massive asteroid on a collision course for Earth, Madison takes her findings to government scientist Covington . Initially he pays her some attention but, under pressure from Air Force General Dutton , dismisses her. In desperation she takes her research to Donovan , a former Air Force officer who was discharged under Don't ask, don't tell. Joining with Donovan's active-duty lover, Mark , the four hatch a plan to infiltrate an Air Force base that houses a massive laser weapon to destroy the asteroid. Despite resistance from Dutton and Air Force troops, the group is able to commandeer the weapon and use it to deflect the asteroid just enough so that it misses the planet. Scenes removed from the censored version include a sex scene between Donovan and Mark, a line in which Donovan tells Madison why he was discharged and a second intimate scene between Donovan and Mark. Additionally, a short scene establishing a romantic interest between Donovan and Madison was added to the end of the censored version.
