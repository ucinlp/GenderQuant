This starts off as an adaptation of Robert W. Service's poem The Shooting of Dan McGrew, complete with a literal depiction of a man with one foot in the grave, but when Dan McGoo turns out to be Droopy, it turns into another Droopy-versus-the Wolf/Wolf-goes-ape-for-the-girl gagfest. The story begins in Coldernell, Alaska - Population 320 and getting smaller&mdash;a wild, rough town where gold is king and gambling, drinking and shooting each other are the major activities. Droopy is Dangerous Dan McGoo, a lone gambler, whose only love is the girl they call "Lou", played by Red . The wolf drags himself into the Malamute Saloon from the 50-below cold and immediately pays for "drinks on the house". In a gag, the wolf wants a drink of whiskey . After he chugs it down, the film shows his stomach being blasted from the drink. His eyes go red, and smoke comes out of his ears. He flies around the room and comes back to the bar. Leaning over to the bartender, he complains, "This stuff's been cut!" As always, the wolf falls for Lou and tries to drag her off, when "The lights went out! A woman screamed and two guns blazed in the dark!" And when the lights go back up, Droopy is victorious, which makes one wonder why the picture is called The Shooting of Dan McGoo since he isn't the one getting shot!
