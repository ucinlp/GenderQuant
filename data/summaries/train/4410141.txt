21-year-old Annie Braddock  has just graduated from Montclair State University. Annie has no idea what or who she wants to be. While sitting in the park, Annie sees a young boy in a uniform almost getting run over. Annie saves him and then the boy's mother, Mrs. Alexandra X , but when she introduces herself as "Annie", Mrs. X mistakes her words for "Nanny" and hires her to look after her young son Grayer. Annie lies to her mother about taking a job at a bank and, in reality, moves in with the X's to be the nanny for Grayer, the boy she saved. Life with the incredibly privileged X's isn't all she thought it would be, and her life is complicated further when she falls for "Harvard Hottie" ([[Chris Evans , who lives in the building. Annie begins to notice that not only is Grayer being neglected, but so is Mrs. X, with Mr. X committing subtly obvious adultery and not treating her like a proper wife. Things turn for the worse when she gets fired, and in her rage, she looks for and finds the 'nanny cam' in the X's house and records her feelings toward the X's. This is accidentally shown at a meeting for East-Side wives, and they all show sympathy toward their own nannies once they view the confrontation of Annie regarding the negligent ways of the parents toward their children and nannies. A few months later however, Harvard Hottie meets Annie in a park and gives her a letter he had received from Mrs. X. She writes how she left Mr. X and is now living a humble life, but now spends a lot more time with Grayer. This leads to a happier ending for all of them, as Annie walks off with Harvard Hottie.
