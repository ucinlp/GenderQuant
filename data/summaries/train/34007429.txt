Krazy Kat is pulling a wagon filled with apples, and is trying to sell them. Unfortunately, most people around are low in cash and are too depressed to eat anything because of bad economic times. Moments later, he found a customer in a VIP coming out of luxury vehicle. Instead of cash, the VIP pays Krazy a check with a considerable amount. Delighted by this, Krazy tries to deposit it in the bank. After getting into a tussle with individuals trying to snatch it, Krazy finds himself chasing his check as it was getting blown away. After an airborne trip, the check found its way into the pockets of an eccentric but kind salesman, much to Krazy's disappointment. However, the salesman advises Krazy to be happy and even puts a smiling mouth on the feline's frowning face. As a result, Krazy was happy and that he pretty much forgotten his problems. Krazy then joined the salesman's act in spreading the smiles. Overtime, the public's depression was gone and somehow their financial problems also followed.
