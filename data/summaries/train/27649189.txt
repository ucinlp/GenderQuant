The adventure tells of a shy librarian, Deborah , who inherits the old and not very tolerable cinema of her father, to protect the family from the shame of bankruptcy. She finally takes the reins in the hand independently, discovers her inner serial killer, waiting with new short films. She does this with the help of her assistant Mr. Twiggs, two insane twins and a robber. When his best friend Judy disappears, Steven discovers the truth about Deborah's actions and tries to stop her as she attempts to murder the audience during her premiere of her feature length film, which is about the audience's deaths. Steven manages to rescue Judy and the audience escapes, killing Mr. Twiggs and the robber as they try to stop them. Deborah kidnapps Steven's mom and takes her to the roof to kill her where Steven confronts her. When Steven points out how disappointed her father would be, Deborah gets emotional, allowing Steven's mom to break free and stab her in the neck with her own knife. Steven then pushes her off the roof to her death. Most of the audience survives and escapes and when the twins come out, the police try to arrest them. Instead of surrendering, they turn on each other and stab each other repeatedly, killing each other. The news talks to Steven about Deborah's movies and the possibility of her actions becoming a movie which he doubts will happen, commenting that if it was a movie, Deborah would rise from the dead by now. As he leaves, a worker causes Deborah's body to move and she seems to stare right at him, freaking him out slightly.
