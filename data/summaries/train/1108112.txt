The only characters are two Anglepoise desk lamps, one large and one small, inspired by a Luxo brand task-light on John Lasseter's desk . Luxo Jr.  and a bigger lamp are playing with a small inflated rubber ball, chasing it and trying to balance on it, as Luxo  reacts to these antics. The ball eventually deflates due to Luxo Jr. jumping on it; Luxo Jr. is admonished by Luxo, who then finds Luxo Jr. playing with an even larger ball, as Luxo just wonders.Lasseter, J.  cited in Mealing, S. .
