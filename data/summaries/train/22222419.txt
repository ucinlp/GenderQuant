Late one night, Barnyard Dawg sneaks into an ostrich hatchery to steal an egg, to place it under Foghorn Leghorn and then get him to believe that he laid the egg as a prank. Foghorn awakens and falls for that. When the egg doesn't immediately hatch, Barnyard Dawg decides to speed up the process by bonking Foghorn on the head with a mallet. The egg hatches an ostrich chick, to which Foghorn immediately warms up to as his own son. Foghorn proudly shows off his "son" to Barnyard Dawg as a gesture of goodwill, but Barnyard Dawg insults the ostrich. The ostrich buries his head in the ground in shame. After an attempt to get back at Barnyard Dawg fails, the plot shifts to Foghorn's attempts to bond with his son, showing him how to play various sporting activities such as baseball and football. Despite these efforts to build the bird's self-esteem and forget Barnyard Dawg's maliciousness, the dog continually and unmercifully mocks the ostrich. The ostrich buries his head with each insult, agitating Foghorn even more. Finally Foghorn has enough of the bullying and decides to defend his son's honor in a boxing match. The bout takes place in a makeshift ring, contained beneath the farm's wooden water tower. When Barnyard Dawg decides to cheat, Foghorn decides to forget the rules and — using a loose floor plank as a catapult — hurls his foe into the bottom of the water tank. Barnyard Dawg returns the favor, and the process repeats several times until the tank becomes dislodged and crashes on top of the ring, leaving both Foghorn and Barnyard Dawg with their heads buried in the ground. The ostrich who had been watching the match remarks: "They've left me all alone. Where did everybody go?".
