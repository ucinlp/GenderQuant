The opening shot is of a shoe lying in the gutter. It belongs to a man who is leaning against a parked car drinking a carton of milk. After a moment, the owner of the car then angrily tells him to stop. As the man walks off, he spots a woman across the road and as he stumbles on the curb - the woman mimics him. He looks at her oddly. She again copies him as he discards his milk carton on a fence and swings his arms. They continue mimicking each other until we see that the man is approaching a crossing in the road. However, the man is enjoying the game too much to realise the danger and continues to imitate the woman who is trying to warn him of the oncoming traffic. He is then struck by a car which flips over and forces his shoe to fly through the air and land in the gutter.
