In this journey the younger of the two brothers makes some observations and has some wild experiences. He discovers that he himself is the son of the absconding father of his would-be sibling. To his astonishment and curiosity he also discovers the gift that this father gives to all his sons: webbed toes. The younger brother, meanwhile, meets an angelic girl and is molested in a betting-house. After that, things get even stranger for the two of them.
