The autobiography written by Gabrielle Carey tells her story of how she made the 'mistake' of falling in love with Terry Haley, a prison inmate at Parramatta Gaol. The character's names were changed for the movie, in which, Jessica Taylor , a young journalist, is sent to a maximum security prison to watch a debate and gather up information for a story she is writing. It is there that she meets long-term prisoner Billy Carter , and after a while, the pair fall in love and want to get married. Just Us is a moving account of a love affair, a totally honest portrait of two people - and a fierce indictment of our prisons and the ways we choose to punish people.http://www.clan.org.au/resources-books-details.php?resourceID=400
