In a movie of slow-pace, the film opens with a wide shot of waves breaking ominously on the seashore, accompanied by Alfonsina's poetry. Another scene has Alfonsina looking into a fish-bowl and saying "I wonder what it would be like to live under the sea". There is also an important scene where Alfonsina announces the news of her illness performed in a very different way from Hollywood film.
