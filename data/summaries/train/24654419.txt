In Sicily, a young thief who has nothing sleeps under the stars and steals and sells oranges. Thievery gets him tossed in jail where his cell mate is Turrido, who offers the thief a deal: get Turrido's ex-lover Rosalba to make a recording of her singing and Turrido will give the thief a piece of land of his own.
