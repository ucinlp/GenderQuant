Eve, , is arrested for doing Salomé’s dance of the veils, from the Bible, at a night club, after her manager, Dan, , calls the police, as a publicity stunt. Sitting in Night Court, Eve meets Gus, , a Bail-Bondsman who posts her bail. When Eve tells Gus that her parents were killed in a theatre accident, it reminds him of a newspaper article posting a reward for finding an orphaned girl, whose parents were killed in such a tragedy. At first, he just wants to collect the reward; but, then it turns out that the missing girl is an heiress, to an estate worth millions. Gus gets greedy, and wants a bigger cut. Eve thinks she has finally found her family; but, most of the family don’t want an exotic dancer in the family; and, don’t want to share the estate. Her Aunt Sarah  and Uncle Horace  are convinced she is their niece. When Gus turns out to be a forger; and, Eve does her Salomé dance for a high society fund raiser, it looks like the gig is up.
