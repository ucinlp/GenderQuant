In 1956, inmate Charlie Forsythe swallowed 60,000 volts of electricity for a murder he did not commit. When Creedmore Prison is reopened after thirty years, it has not been standing empty. Charlie Forsythe is back - still charged with electric heat. Waiting for Eaton Sharpe  - the man who stood by as Forsythe rode the electric chair. Forsythe quickly makes up for lost time as his vengeance rises to a fever pitch of violent fury. Burke  and the other inmates soon realize that they will all be slaughtered unless Forsythe is allowed to repay his long-standing debt. With the lives of Creedmore in the balance, Sharpe and Forsythe are finally brought face-to-rotting-face in a duel that will pit Forsythe's supernatural rage against Sharpe's bloodthirsty instinct for survival.
