But when he witnesses police atrocities on poor peasants, a feeling of guilt engulfs him and he feels responsible for the guilt of his entire class. He is last seen up a coconut tree trying to keep away from the police. A peasant's movement against the feudal system also lies in the backdrop of the film.(For the story, courtesy to and sourced from Cinema Of Malayalam. Here, the feudal lord is shown as a frightened victim of history in contradiction to the normal characterisation as a stereotypical villain.
