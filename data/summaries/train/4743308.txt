Ben Jordan  and his wife Katie  have been married for fifteen years; they have two children, Erin  and Josh , a nice home and a comfortable life. Their happy marriage, however, turns into a sham â€” a performance they deliver daily for the benefit of their children, while behind the scenes they cannot stand each other anymore. Sending their kids off to summer camp, Ben and Katie commence a trial separation, during which both try and remember what it is about the other that caused them to fall in love in the first place.
