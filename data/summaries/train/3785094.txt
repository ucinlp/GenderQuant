Based on real events, it tells the story of Max Stuart , a young aboriginal man who was sentenced to death after being found guilty of the murder of a nine year old girl on what was considered questionable evidence. It follows the fight by his lawyers David O'Sullivan  and Helen Devaney  to save Stuart from execution, as well as Crown Prosecutor, Roderic Chamberlain's  efforts to convict Stuart. Rohan Rivett editor of an Adelaide paper, The News, and its publisher, Rupert Murdoch  also feature as leading the public response in the campaign to save Stuart. In the final scene of the film, Max Stuart appeared as himself as an older man, driving along a dirt highway near Alice Springs where he now lives, and saying: "Yeah, some people think I'm guilty and some people think I'm not. Some people think Elvis is still alive, but most of us think he's dead and gone."<ref namePenelope Debelle | yearhttp://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/08/18/1029114051911.html | title | publisher21 February 2006}}
