Jimmy  is a conman who's been working for a fake insurance company in New York City that is being investigated by the FBI after it cannot pay claims that have poured in after a hurricane. Discovering that his mentor and the mastermind of the scheme, Marvin , has skipped the country and gone to Thailand, Jimmy boards a plane with the intention of trying to collect his money. Once in Bangkok, Jimmy meets Joseph Kaspar , a partner in the scheme who's living with his Thai katoey companion Rocky . Joseph informs Jimmy that Marvin has moved on to Cambodia, where he's planning an even greater scam. So Jimmy sneaks across the border and makes his way to Phnom Penh. He checks into a seedy hotel run by a Frenchman named Emile  and has his passport stolen by another traveller. Later Jimmy has his sunglasses stolen by a macaque monkey. Needing to travel around, he hires a cyclo driver named Sok , who becomes the only person Jimmy can trust. He also meets an NGO worker named Sophie  and dabbles in romance with her while attending a rave party at an ancient temple. Eventually, Marvin turns up, but the scam he's trying to get together – involving corrupt Cambodian government officials, high-ranking military and the Russian mafia – turns out to be more risky and dangerous than anyone ever imagined, taking Jimmy on a surreal odyssey.
