When an abandoned textile mill is reopened, several employees meet mysterious deaths. The link between the killings: all occurred between the hours of 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.—the graveyard shift. The sadistic mill foreman  has chosen newly-hired drifter John Hall  to help a group clean up the mill's rat-infested basement. The workers find a subterranean maze of tunnels leading to the cemetery—and an unimaginable horror that comes alive in the dead of night.
