The story of Champion is like the one of noted Hindi film 'Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander' released in nineties. The main theme of the film depicts how an irresponsible boy can be very responsible at a particular stage of life. In this film we have got a glittering appearance of a new hero at Tollygunge named 'Jeet'. Raja is a college student who is forever committing mischief. He and his peers Bhola, Dhonu & Kanu always stay on the top of the list of failures. Raja has an elder brother, Rohit who is the exact opposite of the infamous Raja. Rohit works at their father's cafe, and is bright in studies. Their father is fed up with the restless Raja. Even after repeated whackings from his father the stubborn mule refuses to change. Raja's only support is his childhood friend Kavita who is secretly in love with him. But the flirtatious Raja finds solace in the spoilt brat Riya, the daughter of a millionaire. Raja saves Riya from the villainous millionaire student Ronny. But Riya dumps Raja & patches up with the affluent Rony. In the meanwhile the devastated Raja starts rigorously practising for the upcoming kick boxing championship final against Rony. All hell breaks loose when Rohit is beaten by Rony & his mates. Rohit is hospitalised in a critical condition. Raja approaches Rohit's coach and begs him to train Raja. Thus a vigorous practice schedule begins. Raja with support from Kavita gets himself ready for the match. In the match he emerges victorious and dedicates the trophy to Rohit and then celebrates his love with Kavita.
