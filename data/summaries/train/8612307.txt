The film centers around a five-year-old black girl, Carolyn, who falls in to an abandoned, overgrown well whilst picking flowers on her way to school one morning. Carolyn's parents seek assistance from Sheriff Ben Kellogg  to help find their daughter. Carolyn's disappearance causes anger and confusion in the community, and various rumors quickly spread amongst the white and black populations when a white stranger, Claude Packard , is arrested on suspicion of the child's disappearance. Packard, a mining engineer, is in town visiting his uncle, Sam Packard, a well-known local businessman, who attempts to use his influence to get his nephew out of police custody. This inflames the racial tension further, and when he is approached by relatives of the missing girl outside the police station, he suffers a heart attack but which spreads amongst the white population as a racial attack. Things quickly get out of hand as various black and white gangs starting attacking one another. The Sheriff requests that the mayor order state assistance to put down the potentially serious disturbances and readies voluntary deputies to break up the growing white mob at Sam Packard's warehouse. Before events can spiral out of control, Carolyn is found alive in the well but cannot be easily extracted. It takes the combined effort of all the townsfolk, and the visiting mining engineer, to safely rescue the small girl and return her to her family.
