Vichu, Varadhu, Vaithi and Govind are four friends and they earn their livelihood doing Kathakalakshepam. They want to become rich and famous. They come across an old lady, who advises them to meet a Swamiji who, she tells them, would help them to become rich overnight. The Swamiji agrees to help them but on one conditionâ€”they should retrieve a holy necklace from Rakshasas who live in a cave. The four friends set out to the cave where they meet a colorful character from the sea, a gold palace, and of course, the Rakshasas too. Lured by wealth, the four friends estrange. What happens then forms the crux.{{cite web}}
