As the Princess tries to deceive her husband and run away with her lover, Ernie , the Prince uncovers the Fleshapoids' illicit romance and attempts to stop them. But Xar flips out again and he and Melenka kill the Prince. But, with death also comes life, as Xar and Melenka's unusual lovemaking produces a cute baby robot.
