{{Expand section}} A dam being built by Stephen Gray comes under attack from the mysterious pilot, The Black Ace, and his "Mystery Squadron" of pilots. The identity of the Black Ace is so secretive that it is even concealed from his own men in the Mystery Squadron. Fred Cromwell and his partner Bill Cook seek to identify the Black Ace and stop his attacks on Gray's construction of the power dam. Cromwell and Cook struggle to identify the Black Ace, as a number of characters behave suspiciously, including Lafe Johnson, a rival contractor to Gray; Martin, the hotel owner; Collins, a construction employee for Gray; and Dr. Flint.
