Upon returning home from work on his birthday, Steve--a middle class husband and father of two--finds the house dark and his family not home. He notices a chair, his television set, and a video tape obviously set out for his viewing. He turns the TV and VCR on, and begins to watch a tape made for him by his wife, Alexandra. As the video proceeds to show Alexandra begin a striptease, at first it appears to be nothing more than a birthday gift. But as it progresses, it becomes clear that the tape is designed to torture Steve due to marital problems that Alexandra has been stewing about for years. She feigns breast cancer, has sex with their neighbor, and tells Steve that neither she nor their two children are ever coming home.
