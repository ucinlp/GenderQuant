The film opens with Angus Buchan's story as he grows his preaching audience to a few men in a field in 1979, to audiences of some 300,000 at his Mighty Men's Conference in the year 2010. Along the way, Buchan deals with personal difficulties of his own including a heart attack suffered in 2009. It includes real-life footage of Buchan leading one such Conference. The story then shifts to three interwoven stories, based on real characters and real events. These include Lucky Nzimande , a criminal who unwittingly attempts to hijack what turns out to be two policemen on their way to the Mighty Men's Conference. After his gun fails to fire on Lucky, one of the policemen takes this as a sign from God that he is meant to take the man to the conference with them. Andr√© Cloete  is an alcoholic young adult who is self-destructing quickly due in part to his emotionally absent but strictly religious father, and John Peters , is a middle-aged panel beater and biker whose life is falling apart around him due to his heavy drinking after the death of his son and to his deep debts after having stood surety for a biker friend, Danny Boy . These three men and their friends and associates all make their way to a Mighty Men's Conference where their lives are changed forever after hearing Angus Buchan's preaching.{{cite web}}
