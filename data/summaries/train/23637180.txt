World War II has not been over for long. Jack Chismore, a veteran suffering from PTS runs a gas station in Las Vegas, Nevada. Jack is married to Lily, and stepfather to Lily's three daughters including Rose, a teenager at an impressionable age. Lily's sister, Starr, has come to Las Vegas for a quick divorce and comes to live with them, upsetting the routine of what is already a small and cramped house. Lily lands a job with the Atomic Testing Office and can't tell Jack, or the girls when the military is conducting atomic-bomb testing in the desert region nearby. This angers and frustrates Jack, who takes his anger out on Rose many times. When Rose runs away it is Jack who shows the most courage and concern.
