Norm  the matchmaker at Hopeless Romantics can find surprising love matches for anyone, no matter how strange their behavior. However, when Norm hires sassy protégé Monique  and tries to teach her the tricks of the trade, they encounter the wildest clients he's ever had, some of whom are: * Marina , a female nudist who seeks someone who will share her views on social nudity and sexuality. That is, someone who will see her constant nakedness in appreciation of the human body rather than an invitation for sex. * Norm himself, who always feels incomplete in sex due to his failure to experience simultaneous orgasms with his female partner. * Cecilia , a hypersexual woman who can't talk to men in private without immediately raping them at gunpoint and/or by knocking them out . She does the latter to Norm himself when she first presents her problem to him in his private office, and the former to Monique's former boyfriend . * A house cleaner, who is aroused by pubic hair. Therefore, she either collects it from her clients' houses or sneaks up on her male clients and plucks their pubic hair directly. * A man who is arroused by cats. * A bodybuilder who feels his penis is too small. * A woman who can only reach orgasm while standing upside down on her head. * Chad ([[Brad Yoder , a pool guy who can't help peeing into his clients' swimming pools for arousal. * Ivan , a "handicapped" gay man who uses his wheelchair as an excuse to stare at people's crotches. He's unable to do so directly, as he feels unwanted in the gay community due to his older age. Somehow, Norm and Monique find the right match for each of their clients as well as for themselves. Thus ending the movie on the positive note that there's a right match out there for everybody.
