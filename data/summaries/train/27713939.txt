Placed behind bars during the war, Diego Callahan, also known as "Macho," travels to Texas looking for the man responsible for his imprisonment. He quarrels with a one-armed Army colonel named Mountford and kills him, observed by Alexandra, the officer's wife. Vowing vengeance, she immediately puts a $1,000 bounty on Callahan's head. Seeking his own kind of revenge, Callahan locates the man he's looking for, Duffy, and hangs him from a windmill. Harry Wheeler agrees to hire a team of bounty hunters and give chase. Alexandra also sets out in pursuit, only to have Callahan overpower and rape her. For reasons of her own, the woman now loves Callahan, but it is too late. Wheeler's men are determined to collect that reward, and Callahan finds that he can't kill them all.
