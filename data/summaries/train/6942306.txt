When wealthy, well-known practical joker Henry Russell  dies, four relatives find out that they stand to inherit considerable sums ... provided they commit acts that are completely contrary to their natures. Law-abiding Deniston Russell  has to get himself arrested and jailed for 28 days. Difficult, snobbish Agnes Russell  has to find work as a maid and keep her job long enough to qualify. She ends up with irascible Gordon Webb , who deduces that his new servant has to keep her job for some reason and proceeds to make her life difficult. Simon Russell  is a womanizing cad; his task is to marry the first single woman he meets. Timid Herbert Russell  is assigned to hold up the bank where he works, with a toy pistol. All except Agnes Russell succeed in their tasks, but she gains happiness in other ways, as do Denniston and Herbert Russell. Only Simon Russell, who has cheated slightly, finds that he has married a girl as devious as himself. There is a marvellous twist at the end which I will not reveal to avoid spoiling the enjoyment of those not yet fortunate enough to have seen it !
