The Stooges, who are working as menders, are asleep under their wagon when a broken hydrant washes them down the street, mattress and all, and into the path of a truck. Rudely awoken by a beat cop, they set about drumming up business. Curly attempts to fix a flat tire , and Moe and Larry struggle to get Curly out of his too-tight sweater. They later arrive at a construction site and poke holes on the bottom of the workers' lunch boxes, offering to fix the holes for money. When their ruse is discovered, they are chased onto the actual site and blend in with a crowd of people looking for work. Curly states that they are "the best riveters that ever riveted," and the hiring workman  sends them to work on the 97th floor, despite Curly's debilitating fear of heights. The construction scene features a classic gag of Larry heating a sausage for Moe to eat, and then he grills up a rivet and throws it to Curly, who thinks it's a sausage, and he proceeds to chew the rivet, claiming "It's a weenie, but it's kind of tough." Curly uses a hard hat with a screwhead to engage the rivets while Moe drills them. Here another classic Stoogery ensues as Curly overturns a bucket of grease, which allows him to slide off the building and land on a hot grill below after Moe drills the rivet against his hard hat. The Stooges do a lousy job riveting and part of the building collapses when head foreman Mr. Blake  leans against a beam. He and several men chase the stooges, who escape by parachuting off the building and landing in their wagon below. They drive off with the parachute still covering the wagon, impairing their driving vision.
