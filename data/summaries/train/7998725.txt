A romantic triangle turns fantasy into reality in this comedy from Hong Kong. Fung Yip  and Mo Wan  are a pair of young cartoonists who have been hired by a comic book publisher to help write and draw a new superhero comic. Both Fung Yip and Mo Wan become seriously infatuated with Mandy , a beautiful girl who works in the office, and as the friends become rivals for her affections, their characters become increasingly contentious; in time, the superheroes they've created come to life and begin settling their differences using their fighting skills. Nicholas Tse also appears in a dual role as the two rival comic book heroes. Comic King pokes fun at several of the trademarks of the comic industry, including the marketing and packaging of the comics themselves. Those familiar with the "industry" will enjoy the in-joke references.
