The wealthy Skorsky runs an armored-car service with high-tech surveillance and weaponry. He also has ties to a criminal organization and is being investigated by Douglas, a government law-enforcement agent. Tony Ferris takes a job as a dealer in a Las Vegas casino to become acquainted with Ann Bennett, a compulsive gambler who works for Skorsky, a married man who has designs on her. At first she is offended at realizing that Tony seduced her simply to learn more about Skorsky's organization, but eventually she assists his plan to pull off a heist of an armored car in a remote part of the desert between Las Vegas and Los Angeles.
