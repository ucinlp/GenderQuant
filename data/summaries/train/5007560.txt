Originally from Pennsylvania, Jamie Conway  works as a fact-checker for a major New York magazine, but because he spends his nights partying with his glib best friend  and his frequent cocaine abuse, he's on the verge of getting fired by his boss, Clara Tillinghast . His wife Amanda, a fast-rising model , just left him; he's still reeling from the death of his mother  a year earlier; and he's obsessed with a tabloid story about a pregnant woman in a coma. The movie captures some of the glossy chaos and decadence of the New York nightlife during the 1980s and also its look at a man desperately trying to escape the pain in his life.
