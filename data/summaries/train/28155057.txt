Sergeant Jack Watson and the eight men under his command are travelling through the Libyan desert in an Allied convoy when their truck is destroyed by Italian forces and they find themselves stranded as the convoy moves on without them. They take refuge in a semi-derelict desert fort, where they must hold out while being besieged by the Italians, with only a limited supply of ammunition and their own wits to help them survive. Lacking a budget for large-scale battle scenes, Nine Men focuses tightly on psychological tension and the personal interactions between its nine protagonists.
