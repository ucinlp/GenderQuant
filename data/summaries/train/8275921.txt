This movie is about the story of Luis "Chavit" Singson , a Philippine politician, and the Governor of the Ilocos Sur province in the Philippines. Singson is known to have started EDSA II in October 2000 when he alleged he gave Philippine President Joseph Estrada 400 million pesos as payoff from illegal gambling profits. Estrada was put under investigation, but on 16 January 2001, a key piece of evidence was blocked in court, leading to protests in Manila and other major cities backing then vice president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo resulting in the ouster of Joseph Estrada.
