Engineer Cal Miller's unauthorized attempt to close off the dangerously unstable Madison Bridge is foiled by the police pursuit of a robbery suspect. The chase ends in a multi-car accident in the middle of the bridge, which begins falling apart during the confusion. The wounded police officer and a handful of bystanders find themselves stranded with the armed suspect upon a short stretch of crumbling pavement high atop a single collapsing pylon, as Miller organizes a rescue operation.
