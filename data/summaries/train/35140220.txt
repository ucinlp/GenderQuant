Tsatsiki's girlfriend Maria suddenly brakes their relationship; she "doesn't believe something about love", and hates Tsatsiki's flowers because "krukväxter ger man bara till gamlingar" . A few days later his best friend Per Hammar also leaves Tsatsiki, because Tsatsiki made him unlucky with saying to Maria that "han kissar i sängen" . Later Tsatsiki, "Morsan" and Göran will travel to Greece where Tsatsiki's father, grandfather and cousin Elena live. A few days before the journey he goes to Maria who lost her pen box at school, and tells her that Göran and Niclas said that the flowers were a "love gesture", but she doesn't believe it and says that he can "go to Greece and after that tell her what love is if he can learn about love there". But when they're going it comes problems; Niclas says that he, "Morsan" and their rock group will go for a concert tour to Japan, but soon Tsatsiki allows "Morsan" to go and instead he lets Grandpa  go with him to Greece, where Tsatsiki's paternal grandfather who is terminally ill  and Elena tells him what love is. Before his paternal grandfather dies he shows Tsatsiki and grandfather the place where he first met Tsatsiki's grandmother who was a member of the greek resistance like him during World War II they fought for the freedom against the germans. When he comes back home, he goes to Per and apologizes and they go, together with Göran, to Strömmen where it's a fishing competition which Tsatsiki and Per planned before Tsatsiki made him unlucky. Later he goes to Maria and tells her that he learnt about love in Greece and she loves him again. Now he understands that the most alone person on the whole Earth is he/she who doesn't have any friend.  * Morfar, vet du vad jag tycker är viktigast? &ndash; Att ha en kompis.
