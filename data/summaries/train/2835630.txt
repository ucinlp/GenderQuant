When Colin arrives in Hope, Vermont, a patriotic town in Northeastern United States in the fall time, he checks into a hotel showing clear signs of emotional distress. The hotel manager, Joanie  sees the state he is in and calls over her friend Mandy to soothe him and take his mind off his troubles. Colin and Mandy eventually fall in love with each other, Colin seeming to finally get over the loss of his fianc√©e Vera. Suddenly, Vera shows up in Hope and tries to get Colin back. Colin is no longer interested but Vera does not give up. Later Colin visits Vera in her hotel room where she changes into her underwear but the fire alarm is set off. Mandy then sees the two together and assumes Colin took her back. Colin promises never to talk to Mandy if she gets a passport. Vera finally accepts that she and Colin are over and becomes Queen of Hope at the town festival. After Colin leaves Hope, Joanie tells Mandy that Colin's cousin was supposed to meet him but forgot to cancel the meeting and that she should pick him up at Hope Springs. When Mandy gets there she finds it is Colin and he proposes, giving her a gold engagement ring with their names on it. Colin starts carrying her back to the hotel, where they pass and wave to Vera, Mr and Mrs Peterson and the residents of Shiny Shores where Mandy lives and works. During this time Mandy tells him that she is too heavy and warns him of hurting his back. When they finally get to the hotel and undress, Colin hurts his back despite Mandy's warnings.
