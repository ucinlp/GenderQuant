Fa is a gentle and unassuming member of an eccentric religious sect cloistered in the Catskill Mountains. On the eve of her group's scheduled "departure from Earth" Fa discovers that their leader, who appears to them as an alien hologram transmitted from a distant galaxy, is crossing signals with a man named Malcolm who lives close by. After failing to convince the others of what she's seen, Fa sets out alone into the "real world" to find Malcolm and confront the awful truth face to face.{{cite web}}
