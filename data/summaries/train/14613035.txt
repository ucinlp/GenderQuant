Sally Maitland  boards a ship bound from England for Canada during wartime. Two of the passengers seek her acquaintance, despite her well-known longtime admiration for Nazi Germany, Jim Garrick  and Polish officer Jan Orlock . It soon becomes common knowledge that Jim is in British intelligence. Sally rebuffs his advances, but welcomes Jan's attention. The ship is stopped in mid-ocean by a U-boat, and a boarding party takes Jim prisoner. To the puzzlement of the ship's captain, the submarine allows him to continue on his way. It also turns out that the Germans have captured an imposter when Jim emerges from hiding. When they reach the port of Halifax, Jan introduces Sally to his mother, Madame Orlock , an invalid. The two women disagree over their opinions of the Nazis. Later, when Sally tries to break off their relationship, Jan reveals that he is working for the Nazis. Orlock recruits her into his spy ring on the night of the their greatest exploit. To Sally's surprise, the leader of the ring turns out to be Madame Orlock, who is not actually Jan's mother. She reveals that a ship of an incoming convoy has been secretly replaced by another filled with explosives. When the convoy reaches Halifax, the resulting explosion will wreck the vital port, inspired by the devastating accident of the First World War. Madame Orlock orders Sally to telephone Jim and tell him that a sabotage attempt will be made on the Queen Mary, scheduled to sail later that night, and that all available agents should be immediately sent to stop it. Sally shows her true colours when she divulges the actual plot. Canadian bombers are dispatched to blow up the ship. Meanwhile, Jan shoots Sally before Jim can rescue her; fortunately the bullet is stopped by a cigarette case given to her earlier by Jan. She and Jim get married.
