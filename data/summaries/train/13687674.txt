Following the 11 September 2001 attacks in the U.S.A., an explosion in a motorboat shatters the peaceful silence on Christmas Eve in London, UK. Following this incident is a daring robbery from an armored vehicle carrying billions of pounds. The police suspect two East Indians: PP and Sim. They are interrogated extensively amidst allegations that they may be linked to Al-Qaeda. Then crime journalist Monsoon Iyer learns about their plight, meets them, and asks her boyfriend advocate Krishan Pundit to represent them. Krishan meets with the two, listens to their side of the incidents, is convinced of their innocence, and is quite sure that the two incidents &mdash; as well as the deaths of three of PP and Sim's friends  &mdash; were the actions of a notorious terrorist named Murtaza Arzai.
