A former 1960s student activist turned private detective searches for a missing Berkeley activist with whom he shared "the barricades." Moses Wine is contacted by Lila, an old flame from his radical college days. She wants him to work for Miles Hawthorne, who is a candidate running for governor of California. Moses is told that a flyer is being distributed around the state with a doctored photo of Hawthorne standing beside a 1960s radical named Howard Eppis &mdash; a fugitive who had been convicted in absentia for inciting violence against the government &mdash; falsely claiming that Eppis is supporting him for governor. This libel is a clear attempt to destroy Hawthorne's chances for being elected. Moses sets out to find out who is responsible &mdash; with deadly results.
