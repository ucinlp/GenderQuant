Donna Marton has been having an affair with the President of the United States for several months, regularly meeting with him for assignations in a safe house in Washington, D.C.. She is always picked up in a car by a Secret Service agent. In Moscow, an agent in the Kremlin manages to get hold of a secret document identifying Donna Marton as a KGB agent sent to spy on the president. This document is passed back to Washington where it comes into the possession of the CSA . They begin to put Donna Marton under surveillance. The same day, her brother Ben Marton - a Washington businessmen and occasional courier for the CSA - arrived back in the city. On the plane he meets and romances Mugsy Evans. When Donna Marton suddenly turns up dead in her apartment moments before she was due to be picked up by her Secret Service driver, he begins to investigate. He discovers her affair with the President, and through his contacts with the Secret Service, he discovers a CSA agent was seen leaving her apartment building around the time of his death. The Secret Service agent who regularly drove Donna, informs him that the CSA were there, but before any more information can be passed on he is killed. Realising now that the CSA had played a large role in her death, Ben Marton confronts the head of the CSA who tells him it was the Soviets who killed her, and that she was a Soviet agent. He explains that the man who probably performed the deed was the head KGB agent in Washington, Anatoly. Anatoly is the Soviet Naval Attach√© who he interrogates at gunpoint in the car. He tells him everything he knows - that the classified document identifying Donna Marton as a Soviet agent was a fake, designed to throw the CSA off-balance, which had always been intended to fall into American hands. The KGB had thus hoped to destabilise the White House during crucial talks with China.
