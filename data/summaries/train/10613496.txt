Set in the 1980s, the movie is a tongue-in-cheek homage to classic 80's horror films such as Night of the Demons, the Friday the 13th and Halloween films and Sleepaway Camp. A group of teens has decided to meet in a haunted house to hold a seance. The characters are stereotype spoofs of other 80's film characters: the cool hero guy , the naive girlfriend , the goth girl , the tough guy , the ditzy blonde girl , the shy geek in love with the blonde , two big nerds , and a pair of lipstick lesbians . Expected before it even begins, and just as in 80's horror style, strange things begin to occur... outrageously corny deaths, gratuitous nudity, obvious pitfalls and traps, inane dialogue, and the teens themselves being one-by-one stabbed and sliced... with the cool hero working to save the day before every stupid teenager is dead.
