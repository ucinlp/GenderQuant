A Swiss bank learns that the confidentiality of several anonymous numbered accounts has been compromised and blackmail threats have been made to five holders of the accounts. They include a crooked arms dealer, who received a demand for five million Swiss francs. He refuses to pay and is shot dead. The bank is also told to pay ten million francs to keep the accounts secret. The bank hires David Christopher , a former U.S. Treasury official who now resides in Geneva. In the course of his investigation, Christopher talks to the four living blackmailees - beautiful ZÃ¼rich resident Denise Abbott , Texas businessman Dwight McGowan ([[John Ireland , Chicago crook Robert Hayes  and Dutchman Andre Kosta . He identifies a number of suspects. One is Rita Jensen , the mistress of the bank's vice-president, Franz Benninger . There is also Benninger himself as well as Korsak  and Sando , who are out to kill Hayes and Christopher. Bank president Johann Hurtil  cannot believe that Benninger is corrupt. However, it emerges that the latter transferred control of a bank account to his mistress, who was legally entitled to it but didn't have the correct documents. Captain Hans Frey  of the Swiss Federal Police is suspicious of Christopher's activities and follows him. The bank decides to pay the blackmailer, using uncut diamonds. Christopher insists on accompanying the diamonds to the collection point high in the snow-covered Alps. The blackmailees turn out to be blackmailing each other and the collector of the diamonds is shot, falling off a high alpine rock face. Christopher recovers the stones.
