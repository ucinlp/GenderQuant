Four boy-penguins are curious about an abandoned cabin. Their mother warns them in song that "curiosity killed the cat." They ignore her, partly because she hypocritically displays her own curiosity over a stovepipe they've knocked to the ground. The boy-penguins joyfully enter the cabin through its chimney. But inside the cabin, they find themselves in danger: two of them fiddle with a kettle of hot water and get hurt. One of them gets hurt when trying to operate a grammophone record, one wants to touch pepper but sneezes everytime he gets near it, one fiddles with a gun and accidentally gets his beak stuck in it, though he later gets it freed. Eventually, a penguin from the group plays with matchsticks and in the process, fire is accidentally created. The fire comes to life and attacks him. The penguin who was playing with the gun, accidentally makes it start shooting around. A bullet from the gun hits a rocket box, causing it to fall near the fire and upon being lighted, all the rockets start flying around the house, causing extreme mayhem. Finally, one rocket sends all the penguins flying out of the house and high into the sky. They all fall back into the snow and when their mother comes again, they apologize and say "We promise never ever to be curious again". The four penguins are forgiven, but immediately they  see something mysterious under the snow. When they get closer, the creature pops out of the snow and is revealed to be a polar bear. The bear roars ferociously, causing all the five penguins to run away in fear.
