The dawn of the Space Age is amidst the crucible of World War II. Prompted by gaining pre-eminence in the high-ground of space, the world's triumphant superpowers race to dominate orbit, the Moon and beyond. To this end, the United States government under President Truman commits to founding the National Council of Astronautics  and the United States Space Force  in 1949. After a period of technological development and installation of infrastructure, Eagle One lands the first men on the Moon in July 1963. With continued lunar operations, the eyes of the NCA turn to Mars, landing there in 1968. The 1970s and beyond are devoted to technological expansion and the privatisation of space, leading to a very different modern day. The film is told through the eyes of those who witnessed and lived through these historical events.
