Tony Hall is a film-school student who does not care to make conventional films. His first avant-garde effort features Melisse, who soon becomes Tony's lover and moves in with him. Seeking a grant, Tony is steered to Paul, who's a Hollywood agent, but he continues to reject the notion of making movies that conform to the norm. Tony shoots realistic footage of a couple making love in a car, a derelict, a prostitute, even an argument between Melisse and a young student, Jerry, that nearly turns violent. He alienates all eventually, and is alone in the end.
