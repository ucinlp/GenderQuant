William  is the leader of a group of runaway Confederate soldiers who, with the help of Todd , an escaped slave, and Annabelle, an Army nurse , stage a daring robbery at a bank holding a cache of rebel gold. The heist does not go smoothly, and William's associates soon fall into in-fighting as they head toward Mexico with their stolen fortune. Needing a place to rest for the night, the criminals set up camp in a mansion overlooking an abandoned plantation. On their way through the cornfield, something rushes at them. With a quick draw, Todd shoots, and the group discovers that he has killed a hairless, twisted creature that barely passes for human. It soon becomes obvious that the old house is not as empty as they thought, as a handful of otherworldly horrors make their presence known while William and his cohorts fight over the gold. The former owner of the plantation was a gentleman farmer with a wife and two children. When his wife died, he attempted to bring her back by sacrificing his children, slaves, and any other living creature, hoping that black magic would return her to life. Instead, his murders raised the ire of the local townsfolk, who hung him up in his own field as a scarecrow, leaving him to die. His victims' spirits remain in the house, attacking all who dare enter. As the film closes, everyone has died at the hands of the resident ghosts, and William has accidentally shot Annabelle in a blind panic. As he runs out of the cornfield, fleeing from his actions, he is shot by a group of Union soldiers. The soldiers, however, do not seem to have shot a young man: instead, they appear to have killed a hairless, twisted creature that barely passes for human. Just before the credits, one of the Union soldiers sees two gold coins next to the body, and without telling anyone, suggests that he go check out the plantation. His commander agrees, so long as the soldier returns before dark...
