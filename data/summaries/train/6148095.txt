This documentary from Robin Shou -- who also hosts and participates in the film -- takes a behind-the-scenes glance inside the stunt industry of Hong Kong, which is known for being riskier and less trick-oriented than its American counterpart. In addition to archival and interview footage featuring some of the industry's most prominent stuntmen, Red Trousers - The Life of Hong Kong Stuntmen incorporates scenes from Lost Time  in an effort to illustrate how stuntmen prepare for and ultimately perform in modern martial arts films.
