It is a drama based on a true story, set in a small contemporary Sussex village by the name of Ambleton during the apple harvest season. When Ambleton is faced with a proposal for a nearby motorway, the mayor  is quick to reject it in an effort to protect the tranquility of the village. However, forward thinking restaurant chef and councilor John Miller  embraces the proposal, seeing it as an opportunity to increase business. The ensuing standoff not only divides the community, but the ramifications ultimately lead to devastation and inspiration, as observed through the eyes of a young restaurant pianist and would-be filmmaker . The story resonates with themes of discrimination, youth unemployment and small town politics.
