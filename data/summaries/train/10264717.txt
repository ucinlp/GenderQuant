Senegalese director Ousmane Semb√®ne's Borom Saret tells the story of a poor man trying to make a living as a cart driver in Dakar. While he expects to be paid for his services, he never makes it clear, so when he does not receive payment he is often left feeling disappointed and taken advantaged of. Among the people he meets is a man delivering his dead child to the cemetery. When the man is not allowed in because he does not have the correct papers, the cart driver abandons the body in the ground and leaves the man lamenting over his loss. In another sequence, a well dressed man asks to be taken to the wealthier French quarter of the city. They argue, but the cart master takes him anyway. The city prohibits horse-drawn carts and a policeman fines Sarret, taking his cart payment. The well-dressed man has left his driver and Sarret is now left without a means to earn a living.
