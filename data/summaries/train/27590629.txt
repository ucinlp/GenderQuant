In 1980, young George O'Dowd argues with his parents over his femininity and moves into a squat with Peter, who dresses as Marilyn Monroe and calls himself Marilyn. They make themselves known at Steve Strange's trendy Blitz Club where George gets a job in the cloakroom. George is unlucky in his relationships with men until he meets musician Kirk Brandon. Through Kirk George meets the handsome drummer Jon Moss, on whom he develops a crush. Sacked by the Blitz and spurned by Kirk, George turns to Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren to further his music career. George's spell with McLaren's group Bow Wow Wow is short when the rest of the group reveal to McLaren how much they hate George. But fan Mikey Craig is impressed and asks George to sing in a group he is forming, where George again meets Jon. They have an affair and the group become the very successful Culture Club. Four years later, however, hounded by the tabloid press amid stories of his drug addiction, an unhappy George turns to Jon for advice on his future.
