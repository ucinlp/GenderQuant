Rich enough not to venture forth alone, she brings along her friend Catalina  and the family chauffeur Cotton . Ayre first travels to an Arab country where she meets an ideal lover, a sheik who offers to deflower her but falls asleep almost immediately. Giving up on the sheik, Ayre goes on to Spain, where she meets the toreador Angel  who manages to stay awake. Unfortunately, after she has succeeded in her quest, Angel is gored while bull-fighting. The injury leaves Angel unable to perform in the bedroom, and so Ayre makes it her mission in life to see to his recovery. Along the way, she learns to fight a bull herself as a way of getting her despondent lover motivated to stop moping. Eventually, she is successful in aiding Angel to full recovery, and the film ends with their wedding.
