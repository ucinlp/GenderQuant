Summertime Blues is the last summer before the army, an early 1980s Tel-Aviv summer, during the War of Attrition with Egypt. Four friends are walking on the wild side before life starts walking over them. They have a Rock'n'Roll band and so, they're trying to add some sex and drugs and devour the whole enchilada. It will take them a hot summer to realize how young and naive they still are, how what really turns them on is first love, first heartache and everything in between. Summertime Blues is a summer movie â€“ beach, bikes, girls and music, a whole lot of music and a twist of blues.
