{{Story}} They saw each other only once. At a drunken wedding. Their eyes met. That was it. Something that they have never known before, something they cannot comprehend happened. Now they cannot live and breathe without each other. As if powerful a river stream, an almost cosmic magnetism, pulls them together with irresistible intensity. They feel as if they no longer belong to themselves, their relatives, their friends. She lives with her husband. He is a little older; she is still young and beautiful. They have a little daughter and a mad dog. Do they have love? And there lives he. He, with flaxy hair like steep grass and piercing deep blue eyes. “So what do we do now? – I don't know”. The husband knows. It’s not that he is mad or foolish. He lives his own ways. What do you do when the dog bites the daughter’s finger? Cut the finger off and kill the dog. What do you do when the wife leaves the house for good? Set the house on fire. What do you do when she leaves you for a different man? He has the answer for this one as well. And under a burning merciless sun a boat drifts into the very depths of the wise engrossing river. The two are in the boat. Dressed in niveous blood soaked clothes. Charon’s Boat to eternity.
