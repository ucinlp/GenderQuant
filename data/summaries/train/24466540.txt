A story about two people—a chef and an epidemiologist—who fall in love just as an epidemic begins to rob the world's population of their sensory perceptions. The epidemic causes humans to lose their senses. First, they start crying for no reason. After drying up their tears, they notice they have lost their ability to smell. This is followed by the loss of taste and hearing and finally eye sight. The epidemic is not given a major part in the movie. Instead, the movie focuses on the two lovers and the rest of the people dealing with the situation. For example, Michael, being a chef, has to go on cooking for the people who can't smell nor taste.
