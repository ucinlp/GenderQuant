Jonas Cord becomes one of America's richest men, inheriting an explosives company after his father's death. Cord resents his father bitterly and is psychologically scarred by the death of a twin brother. He believes there is insanity in the family's genes and does not want children of his own. Cord buys up the company stock held by Nevada Smith, who had practically raised Jonas in his real father's absence. He also pays off the gold-digging, nymphomaniacal Rina Marlowe, who had married his father strictly for money. Cord becomes an aviation pioneer and his wealth grows. He ruins a business rival named Winthrop, then seduces and marries the man's daughter, Monica, only to immediately abandon her and demand a divorce. Nevada finds work in western films. Rina also resurfaces to become a movie star for a studio owned by Bernard Norman, who refuses to sell out to Cord until he learns that the alcoholic Rina has died in a car crash. A public relations man, Dan Pierce, betrays his employer, Cord, resulting in Norman receiving more money than the studio is worth now that its main box-office draw is gone. Cord goes on an alcoholic binge and disappears. Upon his return, he decides to actively run the studio, even directing films himself, and casts a call girl, Jennie Denton, to be the studio's new star. Cord coldly cuts ties with aviation partner Buzz and longtime lawyer Mac, then mistreats Jennie so terribly, he is challenged to a fistfight by old friend Nevada Smith and is badly beaten. A contrite Cord returns to Monica, with whom he has a child. He has learned from Nevada that there was no insanity in his family after all, and that his daughter is a healthy, normal girl.
