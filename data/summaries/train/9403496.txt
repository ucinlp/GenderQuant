The film takes place in the small town of La Ci√©naga, at the Hotel Termas, a dilapidated Argentine hotel, during a medical conference. Two young teenage girls, Amalia  and her best friend Josefina , begin to explore their new sexuality and, at the same time, have Catholic religious passion. Amalia lives with her attractive divorced mother , who owns the hotel, and her uncle Freddy . During this time, in Amalia's mind, spiritual and sexual impulses are seeming to converge. One day, in the midst of a large crowd watching the performance of a musician playing the theremin, Dr. Jano , a participant in the conference and hotel guest, rubs up sexually against Amalia. She is upset but takes his inappropriate action as a sign that her Catholic faith has given her a mission: to save Dr. Jano from such inappropriate behavior. Afterward, the object of Amalia's desire becomes the married middle-aged doctor and she begins to spy on him. Amalia's story is partly about an adolescent girl's discovery of her sexual vulnerability and the sexual power she possesses.
