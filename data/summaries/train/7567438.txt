Soorma Bhopali is the owner of a Timber mart. He wants to distribute all his wealth to humanity. His trust and innocence is taken advantage of by the people. Dilwar Khan Dilwala, who happens to be the identical step brother of Soorma, keeps staking his claim on half of Soorma's inheritance. Soorma inherited a priceless necklace which he will have to give to his bride, according to his mother. To get the necklace from Soorma, a group of smugglers send a stage dancer, Sitara, to Bhopal and trap Soorma. Soorma takes the necklace and follows Sitara to Bombay, but two thieves by the name of Kaalia and Sambha relieve Soorma of his belongings, including the necklace.
