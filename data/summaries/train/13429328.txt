John Kinsdale  works in Naples, Italy as a NATO computer specialist. He returns home from work one day to find his beloved family brutally murdered. Grief-stricken, Kinsdale puts his technological skills to use to hunt down those responsible, who appear to be a band of political terrorists targeting Americans. His colleagues  are willing to help him find the culprits, but they and the U.S. military commander and an Italian police inspector  also try in vain to keep Kinsdale from taking the law into his own hands. Another family is slaughtered, but Kinsdale is able to prevent a violent attack on a third. When the terrorists take hostages in a supermarket, Kinsdale single-handedly kills several as the authorities helplessly stand by. {{-}}
