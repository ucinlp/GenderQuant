The story for The Day My Soul Became a Star is inspired by a Native American belief that when a person passes away, their soul becomes a star enabling them to always watch over those whom they left behind and allowing us to look up and eternally connect with our ancestors. The journey begins with a dog and his owner who have a very special connection. The film depicts one possibility of what may happen when we are no longer tethered to our bodies and become free to see all the beauty of the world, understand all languages and appreciate many different cultures from an enlightened point of view. The story comes full circle as the dog looks up to the night sky to find his owner’s shining star watching over him; knowing he and his owner will “be together again someday”.
