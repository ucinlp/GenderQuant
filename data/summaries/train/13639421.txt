Starting in late May 1944, during the German retreat on the Eastern Front, Captain Stransky  orders Sergeant Steiner  to blow up a railway tunnel to prevent Russian forces from using it. Steiner's platoon fails in its mission by coming up against a Russian tank. Steiner then takes a furlough to Paris just as the Allies launch their invasion of Normandy. Steiner's unit is transferred to France, occupying the village of St. Bologne. General Hoffman  orders Steiner to cross into enemy territory and confer with American Colonel Rogers  and General Webster  that the High Command of the German Army  is plotting to assassinate Hitler and would like to surrender. The plan fails and American forces launch an attack on German forces in St. Bologne where Stransky has planned an explosion to destroy both the Americans and civilian inhabitants.
