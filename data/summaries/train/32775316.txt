One day, when he is coming back to his village on a vacation with his bosom friend Deepak, a car accident changes his life dramatically. Deepak, who is driving the car, happens to run over a villager, Shankar, who subsequently succumbs to his injuries. Arjun, however, insists on taking the blame on himself and surrenders to the police. Even as he does this, he is aware that by doing so, he is not merely distancing himself from his dreams but also from his beloved Rajni . In his darkest hour, SP Kunal Singh  enters his life like sunlight and obtains his conditional freedom. What also draws Arjun and Kunal close to each other is their distaste for the activities of the village bully, Veer Mongia. Kunal inspires Arjun to fight Veer Mongia in the village election. How Kunal  manages to turn the tables on Veer Mongia and how Arjun finally escapes from the shadow of guilt, form the climax.
