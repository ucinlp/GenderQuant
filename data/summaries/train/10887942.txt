The film begins with a sleepover of children prank calling people playing the game Seventy Five while their parents are in the other room having drinks. The rules of the game are that you must keep some random person on the line for 75 seconds, and they must believe what youâ€™re saying. As the night goes on the kids go to bed, a man whom the kids recently called calls back, before jumping from a closet and killing all the parents in the house with an axe as the children hide in their bedrooms. Ten years later, Chuck  is murdered in his house by an unknown figure. Meanwhile, Brandon ([[Jonathan Chase  is throwing a party at his fathers secluded mansion. Brandon invites his ex-girlfriend, Karina , so he can try and get back together with her, but she insists that her group of friends also come, including Marcus , Roxy , Shawn , Kareem , Scott  and Jody . As the group are about to leave, Scott decides he wants to change his clothes and runs inside, emerging a few moments later from his house. As the group drive to the house, they stop off at a gas station, where it is revealed Chuck was one of the children from the original Waley murders. Meanwhile, two detectives, Detective Anne Hastings  and Detective John Criton  begin an investigation to find out where the Waley children now are. As they continue their investigation, they discover more of them have been murdered. As the group arrive and the party starts, Brandon and his friend Cal  show everyone around, revealing that the house is filled with cameras which can be monitored on screens in the monitoring room, due to the house previously being used as a reality show set. After a few hours of partying, Marcus suggests a game of Seventy Five. Various people take part, until one caller murders someone for the group to hear.
