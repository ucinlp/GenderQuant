An amiable garage mechanic, Ed Walters , meets Catherine Boyd , a beautiful Princeton University mathematics doctoral candidate, as she comes into the garage, accompanied by her stiff and fussy English fiancé, experimental psychology professor James Moreland . There is an immediate connection, but she refuses to acknowledge it. Finding a watch she left at the garage, Ed travels to her address and finds himself face to face with Albert Einstein , who is Catherine's uncle. Albert, portrayed as a fun-loving genius who along with his mischievous friends, fellow scientists Nathan Liebknecht , Kurt Gödel , and Boris Podolsky , sees Ed as someone who would be better suited for Catherine. The four of them attempt to help Ed look and sound more like a scientist , while at the same time trying to convince Catherine that life is not all about the mind but about the heart as well. This is intended to be Einstein's most enduring legacy to his niece as he realizes that he'll not be available for her for very much longer. Catherine eventually sees through the ruse, but falls for Ed anyway. The very last image in the movie is of a smiling Albert Einstein using a small telescope to spy on the two young moonstruck lovers as they take delight in each other's company.
