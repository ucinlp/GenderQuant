The year 2100. The global warming has caused massive droughts that have led to conflicts and famines. The first victims of the global warming are the Southern populations, forced to leave their lands to immigrate to the North. A massive exodus that makes chaos out of the known world order. Now, the earth is reduced to one giant no manâ€™s land. Lost and defenseless, the survivors have no choice but to return to ancestral rites. All over the world, clans form and fight for the last natural resources and fertile lands.
