Monroe Stahr  is the young production chief and the most important executive of one of the biggest studios of the Golden Age of Hollywood. An unstoppable worker in a time of turmoil in the industry due to the creation of the Writers Guild of America, his life flows between shootings, industry bosses' machinations, discussions with scriptwriters and actors, a battle with the union organizer and an infatuation for a young woman with a troubled past, who is engaged to be married with another man, and for whom he develops true love. As his difficulties grow bigger and his health decreases, his life runs to an uncertain but inevitable twilight that echoes a long gone era.
