A young boy goes to meet a ruined industrialist called the Once-ler in a treeless wasteland and hear his tale of what happened to him. His tragic story documents how he began a thriving business in producing an unnecessary but versatile fashion product called a Thneed derived from the "Truffula trees" native to the land. As his business booms, the forest and its inhabitants suffer as he wantonly clearcuts without regard to the warnings of a wise old creature called The Lorax about the dire consequences of his greed.
