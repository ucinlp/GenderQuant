Dorky Andy , flamboyant Nico , jock Jarod , and nerdy Griff  reunite in Fort Lauderdale for spring break. The plot revolves around a contest -- "Gays Gone Wild!" -- to see who can have sex with the most guys during the duration of spring break. The winner will be crowned "Miss Gay Gone Wild". While Andy seems to have no problem getting men to have sex with him, Nico hasn't been attracting men at all, which prompts a frequent fantasy sequence involving a merman . Andy is troubled, however, when he falls hard for Luis , a charmingly handsome yet innocent virgin. Jarod and Griff are also meeting a problem, as they now are a couple, and are conflicted over whether or not to enter the contest themselves. Meanwhile, a shallow trio by the name of Jasper  seem to be very anxious to win the contest by any means. In a subplot, the guys meet Perez Hilton on an airplane and Hilton pursues a young priest to the bathroom, he hits his head, turning him into a religious zealot trying to dispel the gay activities going on; he is later hit in the head again and changes back.
