Marius O'Dowd  is an Irish doctor who is often drunk. His daughter-in-law Moira  dies during a serious operation which O'Dowd is performing. Although O'Dowd is not to blame, his son Stephen  suspects that Moira died due to O'Dowd operating while under the influence of alcohol, and accuses him of criminal neglect. O'Dowd consequently has his license to practice medicine taken away. Stephen also does not tell his daughter Pat  that Marius is her grandfather, although several years later she becomes friends with Marius and works this out. Marius eventually manages to redeem himself by saving Stephen's life during an outbreak of diphtheria.
