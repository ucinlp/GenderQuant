Vilified as a homewrecker, she attracts the unyielding ire of his embittered ex-wife Carolyn , who is revealed to also be pregnant . Emilia thinks that this is purely out of spite.

Emilia has a breakdown during a fight where she reveals to Jack that the baby did not die in her crib but in fact in her arms: she believes that she killed her own baby. She then tells him that she can also no longer do this, and leaves Jack alone, crying over their daughter. Carolyn phones Emilia to come to her office, after William told her he is ashamed of her, she tells her that she has personally looked into the autopsy report on Isabel and she can confirm that Emilia did not kill her baby.
