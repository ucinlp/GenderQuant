In a distant garrison town, life proceeds at a measured past. The officers drink and debauch, while the soldiers serve. Meanwhile accidentally unleashed human emotions are suffocated by the atmosphere of cruelty and hypocrisy. Lt. Poletaev ([[Yevgeny Mironov  is an irrepressible character. Even the grim character of service in the Red Army following World War II isn't enough to dampen his spirits. Instead, he keeps things lively by accompanying the base's chorus on his accordion, and by attempting to get women to join the chorus. He succeeds in both his quests. Not only that, but one of the woman singers  and he have a nice little romantic spark going. It's too bad that she's the live-in lover of his boss, Col. Vinogradov . "I made a film about love. About a Lieutenant, who fell in love with a Colonel's young and beautiful wife.

Only shot in the head can cleave this knot.", says director Pyotr Todorovsky.
