Overhearing his parents Stephanie and David Tutela having a heated argument, Justin retreats to his bedroom. A few minutes later, Justin peeks downstairs, only to see his mother Stephanie locked in a warm, romantic embrace with none other than Santa Claus . He takes a photo, shows it to his friend, and then sends it to Mrs. Claus. Fueled by his best friend's worries over his recently-separated parents, Justin jumps to the conclusion that his mother is having an affair with Santa. So, Justin decides to behave as badly as possible in an attempt to prevent Santa from coming to his house on Christmas Eve night for him to at least make off with the boy's mother. The resulting hi-jinks include Justin setting traps and throwing snowballs at a street Santa. Justin's mom receives a letter from the post office. Inside was the photo which didn't actually get sent. In the end, he finds out that Santa was actually his dad and apologizes to the street Santa.
