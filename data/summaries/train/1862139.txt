In the film, Eddie  returns to his home town on the south coast of New South Wales. Having left for the city without explanation a few years previously, he tries to pick up the pieces of his life and fit back in to the lives of those he left, including his ex-girlfriend Tully  and brother Pete . The title of the film comes from Eddie's nickname and from his attempts to make a living poaching mullet. The film succeeds in a very human portrayal of the difficulties in living on the fringe of a close-knit community. The drama of the developing relationships is supported by very dry comedy  and detailed but understated design.
