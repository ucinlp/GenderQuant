The National Poultry Show is being held, and Daffy Duck looks at the matinee showing the prizes for the judging. The first prize for best rooster is $5000 , and the best duck is $5 . Daffy, having traveled all the way from Dubuque for the contest, is outraged that ducks rate such a low prize and decides to disguise himself as a rooster  to get $5000. Meanwhile, Henery is being taught all about roosters by his father, George K.  Chickenhawk (a reference to G.K. Chesterton. Henery decides to head to the poultry show and catch himself a rooster. Daffy's plan backfires when Henery decides to take him home. Daffy says he's a special breed of rooster, and thinking that Henery's father, described as "the greatest judge of chicken flesh in the world," is the judge to give him the $5000, he tags along. Daffy then finds out he is in a chickenhawk's house, and tries to escape, but fails. Henery's father then starts to prepare Daffy as a meal. Daffy tries to prove he is really a duck, even trying to take his disguise off . When he tries to escape, Henery's father grabs his "head" , and the glove lands on his head, then he proceeds to chase Daffy, who is finally able to escape when Henery accidentally hits his father with a mallet. Before the contest begins, Daffy puts on another glove. Then, at the contest, Daffy loses to Henery's father, disguised as a Rhode Island red. Daffy then tries for the best duck prize, but loses that as well - to Henery, wearing a disguise consisting of a clothespin and two flippers.
