Two NASCAR hopefuls, driver Larry Rayder  and his mechanic Deke Sommers , successfully execute a supermarket heist to finance their jump into big-time auto racing. They extort $150,000 in cash from a supermarket manager  by holding his wife and daughter hostage. In making their escape, they are confronted by Larry's one-night stand, Mary Coombs ([[Susan George . She coerces them to take her along for the ride in their souped-up 1966 Chevrolet Impala. The sheriff, Captain Franklin , obsessively pursues the trio in a dragnet, only to find his patrol cars unable to catch Larry, Mary and Deke after they ditch the Impala for a 1969 Dodge Charger R/T 440. Larry's vehicle soon enters an expansive walnut grove, wherein the trees provide significant cover from aerial tracking, and the many intersecting roads  making road blocks ineffective. The trio evades several Dodge Polara patrol cars, a specially-prepared high-performance police interceptor, and even Captain Franklin himself in a Bell JetRanger helicopter. Nearing the border and believing they've finally beaten the police, Larry and company meet their doom when they randomly collide with a freight train led by an Alco S1 locomotive.
