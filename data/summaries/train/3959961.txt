On September 27, 1941, Reinhard Heydrich, one of the most feared top officials of the Nazi Party, an architect of the Holocaust and Hitler's possible successor, is appointed "Reichsprotektor" of Bohemia and Moravia. As a result of his brutality and oppression he is also called "The Butcher of Prague" or "The Blond Beast". A squad of agents is selected, trained and then parachuted into Czechoslovakia. The team operated in Prague and planned the attack for about six months. The mission, Operation Anthropoid, is successfully executed in the capital on May 27, 1942 by means of an ambush, but almost fails at a crucial moment when one of their Sten guns jams and they are obliged to use a grenade instead. Heydrich eventually succumbs to his wounds, but during the frenzied aftermath, the group is betrayed by one of its members and they are cornered in a church crypt in Prague. In the gun-battle that follows, all but two of the agents are killed. The remaining ones commit suicide. The German high command takes savage reprisals, including the massacre of 340 men, women and children from the village of Lidice and the razing of the village.
