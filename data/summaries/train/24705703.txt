In a village in Italy, a radio presenter, Carlo Mastelli, loses his hearing, and passes the microphone to Marina, the young teacher, who suggests launching an appeal whereby all listeners send postcards from their country to Tonino, a young student in danger. Artists and celebrities, mostly from Italy and France, take part in the appeal, and a number respond, which at the same time boosts the show's ratings, and brings great happiness to Carlo.
