Timmy Lea and his brother-in-law Sidney Noggett are working as entertainment officers at Funfrall, a typical British holiday camp. The staff are lazy and inefficient, preferring to laze by the pool rather than organise activities for the holiday campers. A new owner, Mr. Whitemonk, an ex-prison officer, takes over the camp and is determined to install discipline into the staff. He is on the verge of dismissing Timmy and Sidney; however, Sidney's suggestion of organising a beauty contest changes his mind. Producer Michael Klinger wasn't happy with the script, noting a number of problems that he felt detracted from the quality that set the series apart from its imitators.http://michaelklingerpapers.uwe.ac.uk/docs1/holiday%20camp2.pdf
