Jim , a gay, overweight telemarketer working for a weight loss program is facing self-esteem issues, whereas Ron , a church minister who preaches about conversion but himself is addicted to watching gay porn, and Javed , a Pakistani lives in the U.S. with a gay porn actor but is faced by the double dilemma of being condemned by his Muslim family and is in imminent danger of being deported from the States. Meanwhile Kelly , a young lesbian weathers a breakup with her lover and considers an earlier affair and Tracy , an Asian lesbian, goes back in the closet when her mother renders a visit.
