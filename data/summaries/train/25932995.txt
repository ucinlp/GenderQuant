A plane crashes on an island, and the pilot comes across an alien before a giant spider kills both him and his passenger. One year later, Mercer, the sister of the pilot, accompanies Valentine  to the same island to locate her brother. On the way to a native village to examine several natives who are dying of spider bites, ticks burrow into Reyes . Upon reaching the village, they discover that the village has moved on. Reyes begins to cough up the ticks and Bear  is forced to shoot him to end his suffering. That night, Mercer wanders off and is attacked by a mutated "spider," but saved by a native, who ends up getting bitten and dying the next morning. The group moves on, and are attacked by a giant spider, which kills Henry  and Samuel Leon . A smaller spider attacks bear, and another native is killed. Valentine, Mercer and Susana , Samuel's assistant, hold up in a military bunker. While Mercer keeps watching, the spider attack and forces the survivors into a closet. Susana panics when she sees the spider is gone and is killed. Mercer and Valentine escape through a bomb tunnel into the forest, where Valentine slips into unconsciousness from a bite he sustained. In the morning, Valentine awakes to discover that Bear and Toe Boy , the only surviving native, have survived. The four head into the cave, where they find the spider in a cocoon. Mercer attempts to cut the cocoon down so bear can shoot it, but it wakes up before she can cut it down and Bear is killed. The spider sets chase after Mercer and she ends up wrapped in its silk, which she uses to pull the spider from the ceiling and it falls onto a stalagmite, killing it. As Mercer, Valentine and Toy Boy leave, another spider watches them from an overhead cliff.
