After being accused of crimes he did not commit, a lonely circus clown known onstage as Gurdy  exacts his revenge on those who unjustly condemned him. The act sparks something inside of him which he cannot stop and now, years later, his inner-demons have truly surfaced. Part urban legend, part tabloid sensationalism... he is now an unstoppable murderous juggernaut, fueled only by hate. And worse, when two tabloid reporters  attempt to hunt him down, they find themselves trapped in his warehouse, hunted by him and his conniving daughter , who already has a deceptive plan up her sleeve. It's a gory, horrifying fight for their lives with no telling who will emerge alive.
