It stars Joe Shishido as a hitman who, along with his sidekick played by Jerry Fujio, is hired by the yakuza to eliminate a rival gang's boss. The two are captured after the job, escape and are waylaid once again resulting in a climatic battle. The film was among Shishido's first starring roles, cementing him as a hardboiled action hero, and remains a personal favourite of the 170 films he made at Nikkatsu.<ref name  Schilling | first  No Borders, No Limits: Nikkatsu Action Cinema | publisher  2007 | isbn  http://www.fabpress.com/vsearch.php?CO 79, 96 }}
