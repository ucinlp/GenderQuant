Jeremiah "Jerry" Lane and Pierre Potkin are a couple of carnival workers running an airplane ride. The duo leave their job when they are hired by smuggler Dave Hanlon to fly a real plane in order to retrieve a lifesaver. They believe that the lifesaver only consists of harmless photos, but soon find inside the lifesaver stolen jewels and cocaine. Jerry and Pierre eventually land in the backyard of the Arlingtons' estate. Initially, the Arlingtons believe that the duo are police officers, and readily allow them to stay in their home. As it turns out, the Arlingtons are good friends with Hanlon. When Hanlon is informed that Jerry and Pierre are at the Arlingtons', he convinces the family that the two men are actually lunatics from an asylum. Hanlon and some of his cronies  show up at the mansion in order to bump off Jerry and Pierre, and get the smuggled jewels. However, the jewels have been hidden by the Arlingtons' kleptomaniac dog. A frantic and confusing search around the manor soon occurs, with dozens of cops added into the mix.
