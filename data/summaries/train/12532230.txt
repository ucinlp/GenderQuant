The Pink Panther, seeking nightly shelter from a storm, comes upon a Western frontier ghost town called Dead Dog, and the one hotel in the town is haunted. While trying to stay the night at the Dead Dog Hotel, the panther signs a guest book but the ink splatters his face. He wipes into a chair-covering sheet, which is indeed a nasty ghost because two menacing eyes appear and. When Pink opens a room, he stumbles upon the chair and throws it downstairs because he thinks that the weird creature is an ordinary chair. The ghost returns to the room and heads for the bathroom where Pink takes a shower and just as he is about to attack him, Pink grabs the specter for a towel and throws him to the tub. When Pink Panther gets ready for bed, a skeleton crawls into the bed unnoticed and the two blow the candles simultaneously. Suddenly, a dreadful scream and fighting knocks along with bone shatterings are heard. Pink understands that he place is haunted. After a lengthy battle against the ghost and skeleton, he is able to defeat them temporarily by hitting both with a stick. The ghost dons a six-gun belt and pursues the panther into a wine cellar, where the panther pickles the ghost in a wine keg. The drunken ghost is then inflated like a balloon by the Pink Panther and burst, becoming a group of little specters that join the skeleton in pursuing the Pink Panther in an old grandfather clock, which breaks into pieces. The resulting noise prompts the town sheriff to arrest the Pink Panther and his supernatural foes, until sunrise causes ghosts, skeleton, sheriff, and whole town to vanish.
