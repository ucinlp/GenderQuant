Fourth form boy Tolik Ryizhkov  is a naughty child and fibber. Once he received a box of magic matches while hiding behind the iron door of a transformer booth. Every match, when broken, can act like a magic wand but just once. A boy with his two friends and a dog find themselves on an island of an evil wizard  of their age, who found the equal box of matches and used them to create his own little egocentric world. The young wizard put Tolik's friends in prison and is trying to make Tolik as evil as himself. But Tolik stays faithful to his friendship and rescues his friends without the help of any magic.
