Sorceress Lina Inverse and her traveling companion/arch-rival Naga the Serpent arrive at a town where the art of golem-manufacture is highly prized and become involved in the rivalry between a father and son with very different ideas on how golems should be made. When two rival lords seek the aid of the men in efforts to build golem armies to enhance their power and prestige, the two sorceresses find themselves the central attractions in a festive duel of massive golems powered by their magic. Interestingly, the two main antagonists bear remarkable similarity in their personalities to two characters in Slayers Next, who are also fighting each other for control of the city. The movie begins with Lina Inverse and Naga the Serpent eating. Before they can finish their meal a golem, which is shaped like a bull, stampedes toward them. Before the golem can trample upon the two sorceresses, someone else gets in the bull's way — an innocent civilian. The two sorceresses recite a spell and send the golem flying into the sky. The civilian's name is Laia Einberg; she takes the two sorceresses to her workplace. Laia introduces Lina and Naga to her father and brother, who are golem makers. Laia's brother Huey becomes infatuated with Naga's appearance, while Laia's father Garia takes a liking to Lina. Huey and Garia use the sorceresses as models for their new golems. In Laia's town, people create golems for the golem competition, in which golems battle each other. Lina and Naga are very competitive, and they end up battling it out again — only through their golems. As usual, the movie ends up with Lina and Naga wrecking the town. http://www.inverse.org/e/anime/movie/great.shtml
