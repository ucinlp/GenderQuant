 Razak Kottekkad ([[Sreenivasan  is a migrant social worker in Saudi Arabia who makes an effort to both identify "unknown Indians" whose bodies arrive at the mortuary and to secure their return back home. Meanwhile, we are shown the story of Aswathi , who is a lower mid-class Malayali woman from Pattambi, Kerala. She gets married to a small-time goon, Radhakrishnan  who confesses her about his pre-marriage life and assures a complete change. Unfortunately after a short period of happy life, he gets killed. Due to the financial constraints of her family and the untimely death of her husband, Ashwathi is forced to be the bread earner of the house and opts to go to the gulf. Usman , who is the car driver of an Arab family, belongs to Aswathi's village and he arranges the visa for Aswathi and brings her to Saudi Arabia. She lands in Saudi Arabia and many surprises await her, starting at the airport itself. She is forced to wear a burqa at all times, as part of the dress code of the country. She is subsequently exposed to a rigid culture and a slavery-like vocation and is taken up under a sponsor to work for him as a maid. Aswathi had to face numerous troubles - sexual abuse and battery in the sponsor's house. Ashwathi is accompanied by Usman, who actually brought her to all the miseries. However, he indulges in a sexual affair with the Indonesian maid there and gets caught and is kicked out of the sponsor's house. Aswathi helps the other maid to escape the premises and in turn is tortured as punishment. The story follows Razak, who tries to trace Aswathi who had mysteriously disappeared during an attempt to escape torture. On the parallel, we see Aswathi running into some good and bad people, eventually culminating in a deportation. After entering into much more troubles, she reaches Razak, who was actually in a search for her. He inquires her about the complete story. He eventually helps Aswathi leave for home back in Kerala.
