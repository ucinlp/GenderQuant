Told in a non-linear, stream of consciousness style, the film depicts the deceitful relationship between a master and his two servants. The master's actions and behavior are very mysterious and secretive, which causes his manservant to be suspicious of his whereabouts. The Master is seen doing such things as writing a letter in the secrecy of his study room, gathering eggs from the side of a cliff, and it is even implied he had an affair with the female servant. One day, the shocked manservant discovers the Master in a barn feeding the eggs he gathered to a huge boar, much to the Master's shame. Sometime later, the Master is shown setting the pig off into the wild, perhaps a form of reconciliation with the male servant . With his mental health deteriorating, the Master sheds his clothing and jumps over the edge of the cliff, presumably to his death. Sometime after these events, the two servants are seen tending to the Master's now vacant bedroom, and appear to be going their separate ways. However, the manservant secretly follows the woman and watches aghast as she begins walking towards the same cliff the Master committed suicide on. What happens next is unclear, and the film ends with the following epilogue: :"This all happened within {{Nowrap}} of the city of Kiev in the town of Bucha. :I was the only witness of these events.&nbsp;â€“ Andrey Svislotskiy".
