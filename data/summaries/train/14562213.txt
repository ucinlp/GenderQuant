Two British Nationals are killed by a ferocious tiger in Orbit Park, This incident follows several other incidents, and many deaths result, prompting a National Geographic correspondent, Krish Thapar ([[John Abraham , and his wife, Riya Thapar , to take a trip to this park and ascertain what really happened. A group of youngsters, consisting of Dev Malhotra , Ishika , Sajid , and Vishal , on a thrill and hunting trip also arrive there in the hopes of sighting and shooting some big prey. Both Thapar and Malhotra groups meet with each other, and seek the guidance of a local called Kaali  after he saves them from a tiger attack. Slowly it emerges that the people being killed are not being killed by tigers but a person. Dev looks like the main suspect since he is usually not around when people are being killed. Kaali tells them all about a recent story of how overhunting was destroying the jungle. One local guide got very upset by this and started leading tourists astray and getting them killed by tigers. When this started affecting the tourist trade, other villagers and local guides beat that guide and threw him to the tigers. The local villagers now believe that his ghost is killing everyone who breaks the jungle's rules. That night while spending the night at an isolated inn, Riya is murdered in what appears to be an accident. Then Dev sees that there is no reflection of Kaali in the well or video in Riya's handycam confirming that Kali is the vengeful ghost. They trick Kali and escape the jungle narrowly escaping death due to Kali's rage. Krish later writes an article about the forest, Kali and loss of his wife, Riya. He states that there is no way to stop Kali as even after reading his articles of warning, people still wander in the forest.
