Four stories, four dramatic destinies about real people. The first, a rich businessman who solve his infertility problems but little matter to his wife. Then a mother, poor and with two children, who can not rely on anyone but herself in a chaotic city. A middle age man, who learns not to be able to build social relationships after a life spent in working. And an older woman, whose life was entirely spent in search of a meaning. Four people affected by the same unjust fate, that strikes everyone without discrimination, living stories than speak on family, inner expiation and love.
