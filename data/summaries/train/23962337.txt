Pierre and Thérèse, two stuffy well-to-do volunteers at a telephone helpline for lonely and depressed people, are stuck with the Christmas Eve shift in the Paris office, much to their displeasure. The building's lift is malfunctioning, and they receive visits from unwanted callers: Katia, a depressed transvestite who wants to hit on Pierre, and Josette, a heavily pregnant woman on the run from her fiancé Félix. Félix is working as a Santa Claus during the season and turns up on her trail in costume and brandishing a gun. Félix and Josette, a caricature trailer trash couple, end up struggling over the gun and accidentally shooting dead the lift repairman, whom they then butcher and feed to zoo animals.
