The film begins at Gesualdo's castle, where a worker gives a tour. Several people are encountered at the ruined castle, including a man who plays music into the cracks in the walls in order to deal with the demons which haunt the place, and a woman who claims to be the ghost of Donna Maria d'Avalos, Gesualdo's wife whom he murdered. Two cooks discuss and reconstruct an extravagant wedding feast which Gesualdo had ordered. Herzog also visits some workers from a local mental health clinic, who claim that they once treated the woman who claimed to be a ghost, and that they in fact have two patients currently who believe themselves to be Carlo Gesualdo. Herzog also interviews workers at the Palazzo San Severo in Naples, where Gesualdo committed the murders. A gate worker is interviewed, as well as the heir of d'Avalos, who shows Herzog the very bed in which the murders took place. Herzog then visits a nearby chapel which displays the preserved bodies of Maria d'Avalos and her lover. These scenes are intercut with performances of Gesualdo's madrigals, as well as some historical and musical commentary by Gesualdo scholars.
