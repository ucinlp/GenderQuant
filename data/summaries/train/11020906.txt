This original story marries three different elements into one plot. The movie is basically a film noir, where a self-destructive, down-and-out investigator takes on a case that may be more than he can handle. Incorporating standard elements like a beautiful woman, excessive drinking and subtle voiceover, the piece is set up like a standard detective film. Later a science fiction angle, which is part conspiracy and part nouveau alchemy, is introduced. This component, to some degree, extends the common understanding of quantum physics. Within this framework the unbelievable is now possible and the story is set up for special effects and general creepiness. One final ingredient is comedy. Mostly situational, the laughs come from the somewhat uncommon characters thrown together in this extraordinary scenario. Rather than punchlines; reactions, comparisons and slapstick are used to ease the tension and create a more fun atmosphere. Not to be forgotten, this is first and foremost a horror movie. Where the film consists of a variety of different genre elements, Aversion is simply a suspenseful film of demonic possession.
