Confederate soldier Capt. Colt Saunders comes home to Texas from the war. Victorious supporters of the Union have taken control of his town, including a corrupt commissioner named Cable. When he sees a Yankee insult a Southern belle named Lorna Hunter, the gallant Colt comes to her aid. He isn't aware of her past as a St. Louis dance-hall girl or her villainous true nature. Colt is knocked cold and Lorna steals $900 from him. Her friend, saloon owner Ruby, lets her know that Colt is a wealthy rancher, so Lorna hatches a scheme. She returns his missing $900 and impresses him with her "honesty." Colt falls in love and marries her. His ranch, the Bar S, has fallen on hard times. Loyal ranch foreman Innocencio, who looked out for the spread while Colt was off to war, says that Yankees have been rustling their horses with no intervention by the law. Colt's brother, nicknamed Cinch, shows up. Cinch is not trustworthy, but Colt has felt obligated to him since a childhood accident. Cinch is allowed to help run the ranch. But as soon as Cable claims that $16,000 in back taxes must be paid, Cinch makes off not only with the rest of Colt's horses but with Lorna as well. Lorna is pregnant. Colt tracks them down and offers to give them more money if she agrees to give birth first and leave the child with him. In a gunfight to determine who gains ultimate control of the ranch, Cinch and Cable are both killed. Lorna has a change of heart and persuades Colt to let her stay.
