A man moves his family into a suburbia that at first seems fantastic, but soon turns into a nightmare. "Set in a high-price Malibu community, this made-for-TV drama wallows in a multitude of extramarital affairs, corporate intrigue and elegant back-stabbing, with murder the logical extension to all the hanky-panky. Characters crucial to the plotline are a cop posing as an auto mechanic, and a sexy nanny who intends to break up her best friend's marriage. The ending is abrupt and unsatisfying, a sure sign that the film was actually the pilot for an unsold series. Written and produced by Dynasty veterans Richard Shapiro and Esther Shapiro, The Colony was originally consigned to a "dog day" timeslot on July 4, 1996, by its parent network ABC. - Hal Erickson, Rovi" http://www.moviefone.com/movie/the-colony/1368948/synopsis
