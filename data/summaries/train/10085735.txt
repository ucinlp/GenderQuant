The film tells the story of the sophisticated Director General of the National Broadcasting Group  who promotes the ambitious Head of Complaints to Programmer Director  in an attempt to stem the number of complaints he is receiving owing to the station's overly intellectual programming. In 1930's British slang, the acronym "NBG" stood for "no bloody good". The character played by Hay is clearly intended to be a satirical parody of Lord Reith, and the NBG the BBC.
