 The Police Commissioner is very much impressed by the Inspector,Gautam, so The Police Commissioner assigns him to a notorious town controlled by criminals, where earlier policemen have not been able to continue there for long time. Gautam accepts this challenge and joins the town police station. Dharamdutt is the rich and arrogant "ruler" of that town. Now Dharamdutt wants this new tough cop to be eliminated, so assigns his hit man Govinda to eliminate Gautam.
