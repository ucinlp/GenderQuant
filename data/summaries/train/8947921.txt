Tommy Turner  is an English teacher at football-crazed Midwestern University in this comedy-drama. Although he is uninvolved with the politics of the day, Turner suddenly finds himself the center of a free-speech debate on campus. An editorial in a student magazine reveals that he plans to read Bartolomeo Vanzetti's sentencing statement to his class as an example of English composition. The school's conservative trustees threaten to fire him if he doesn't withdraw the reading from his lecture. The subject of free speech and Turner's dilemma of conscience anchor the film's drama. A lighter subplot concerns a return visit by Joe Ferguson , a football hero and former love interest of Turner's wife  at the very moment when their marriage is being tested by the events on campus.
