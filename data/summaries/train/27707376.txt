Schuks Tshabalala  and Shorty  are producing a survival guide to South Africa for tourists visiting the country for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. They take a group of tourists from Germany, Ireland, Greece, China, France, India and The Netherlands and show them what life is like in South Africa. However, the South Africa they see is one created entirely by Tshabalala and Shorty. {{cite web}}
