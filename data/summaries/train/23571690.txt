In 1930 Marseille two small-time crooks, Capella and Siffredi join forces when they meet brawling over a woman. Starting with fixed horse races and fights, they end up doing jobs for the local gangster bosses. When they decide to go into the business for themselves, their easy-going approach to crime starts to change. The first half of the film resembles more or less a comedy, while in the second one firearms are used. In the end Capella is killed and before his death pronounces the phrase: "La chance n'existe pas !"  The film's story continues in the 1974 sequel Borsalino & Co.
