In Drake Industries Research Lab in Kauai, Hawaii, Supergator breaks free from the lab and kills two scientists, then escapes into water. Dinocroc also breaks free by breaking the wall and crushing another scientist. It also eats two scientists and goes into the trees. Jason Drake  calls an elite army group to kill the creatures, but they are killed by the animal. Then Drake calls in Fish & Game hunter Bob Logan  who is also known as "The Cajun" to kill the creatures. While spying on Drake's lab, Paul Beaumont  meets a cop, Cassidy Swanson . It's up to Paul, Cassidy, and "The Cajun" to kill them before it's too late. So they get them to battle at a factory and the Dinocroc kills the Supergator. Paul then throws a bomb and hides in a tub, protecting him from explosives, and the bomb blows up Dinocroc. After they walk away, roars of a baby are heard.
