The movie is set into motion when a large cache of arms is discovered in the land belonging to the local businessman Hussein Sahib . On investigation, Inspector Varma ([[Mukesh  finds that Hussein Sahib has no idea about this, but the land was used by someone called Anali Bhaskaran. The Inspector, along with his colleagues Sudhakaran  go to arrest Bhaskaran, but they are given a good fight. As the police are being beaten, the screen alternates between a police jeep appearing on the scene and Anali Bhaskaran trying to knife people. Suddenly a hand appears in the scene and beats Bhaskaran. He is still the same no-nonsense, arrogant person who follows his heterodox ways of investigation. Anali Bhaskaran reveals under interrogation that Hussein Sahib's son Salim is involved in this. Hussein Sahib says that his son left the house sometime back and he has no idea where he is. Then at this point it starts raining characters as if it is the start of monsoon season. In a span of few minutes we get three villains, MLA Rani , a DGP, Balram's boss ([[Devan , DYSP George ([[Siddique , Policewoman Dakshayani ([[Kalpana , a Chief Minister, a minister called Mustafa, Srini ([[Sreenivasan , the editor of a yellow journal, and a policeman called Ummar . Balram concludes that Tharadas was behind all this and the scene switches to Dubai. After beating his associate, Tharadas meets the minister Mustafa and does some business. He also wants a favor from the minister. He wants a ring to be passed to his girlfriend Supriya  who is an actress. Once the people and linkages are established, the game is set in motion in an even faster pace. Balram concludes that the only way to trap Tharadas is to arrest Supriya. As expected Tharadas lands in Kerala and takes on Balram and it drives rest of the story.
