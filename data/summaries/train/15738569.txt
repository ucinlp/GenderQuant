Obsessive collector J.P. Whittier, determined to obtain specimens of a newly discovered breed of bald eagle, hires rock climber Mike Walker to pose as a photographer and win reclusive conservationist Jim Malden's confidence in order to gain access to eggs from their lofty nest. Before long, Walker is converted to Malden's cause, and with the help of storekeeper Stella Clayton and her son Adam, the two men thwart Whittier's plot.
