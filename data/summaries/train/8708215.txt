The movie is about a young teahouse girl from the Lor people that is kidnapped and taken by a band of thieves when she was little. The leader of the thieves, Gholi Khan, is beginning to look at her with interest with her coming of age. At the teahouse, she meets a young man called Jafar. They fall in love, and plan to escape together. Gholi Khan catches on to their plans and beats up Jafar. Jafar and Golnar, the Lor girl, escape to Bombay to find security from the lawlessness of Iran. They later return in the movie to find a different kind of lawlessness than before. This movie is said to have a political undertone in the plot that suggests the differences under the Qajar dynasty's rule, and later Reza Shah's.
