A daring world record scuba dive to the sunken {{USS}} is witnessed by a man who nearly perished on that same ship over sixty years ago. The destroyer was found to be at a depth of 633 feet  -- deeper than the world record technical dive of 581 feet . Traveling to dangerous depths, this film takes the time to remember fallen heroes, honor comrades and acknowledge those who made great sacrifices. The film explores the state of tragedy, the incomprehension we face when confronted with great, unspeakable loss. This documentary features Rob Lalumiere's record-breaking 193-meter dive to place a memorial plaque on the shipwreck.
