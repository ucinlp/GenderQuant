The Romans have invaded Britain. An army led by Mark Antony , slogging through wet and miserable weather, attacks a village  and capture some people as slaves. They include a maker of square wheels Hengist Pod  and the fearless warrior Horsa , among others. They are taken to Rome, bought by the trader Spencius  and auctioned off. No-one wants Hengist and he's marked down as lion-fodder. When an attempt is made to kill Julius Caesar  at a Roman temple, Horsa fights and kills Caesar's enemies, but Hengist gets all the credit, and is made Caesar's bodyguard. Meanwhile, Mark Antony, Caesar's best friend, is sent to Egypt to negotiate an alliance, but becomes besotted with the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra . The only way to achieve his heart's desire is to kill Caesar . The plan to kill Caesar and Hengist ends up being unsuccessful. Hengist, Horsa and all of their fellow British countrymen escape, capture a galley and make it back to Britain.
