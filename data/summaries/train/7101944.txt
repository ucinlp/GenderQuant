Charlie Colburn  is a video game tester with a troubled past. One day he receives a new console to test in the mail. This video game system, the Gamebox 1.0, is like no other system he's seen before, by tapping into the cerebral cortex of the brain, it literally immerses the player in a virtual reality world. The game draws on his memories so the heroine is modeled after his dead girlfriend  and the villain is the dirty cop  who murdered her. He has to play through three different games to win: Crime Spree, Zombie Land and Alien Planet. The only catch is, if Charlie doesn't win this game it will cost him his life. The actual Gamebox console prop was never given away.
