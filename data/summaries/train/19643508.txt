 At the start of the film, we see a black-and-white television show, which appears to be The Jack Benny Program, although it’s never called this by name. The host  welcomes his special guest , and introduces the sketch for the evening .  Jet Benny , a self-proclaimed “intergalactic soldier of fortune,” is traveling through space in his ship — the Maxwell, piloted by the android Rochester  — when the vessel loses power and crashes down on an unfamiliar planet. After Jet regains consciousness, Rochester and the Maxwell are nowhere to be found; Jet spends the next few years living in the woods like a hermit. One day, Jet sees a woman  being whipped and beaten by a thug and his henchmen, and he uses his raygun to scare them off. The woman turns out to be Princess Miranda; her family and people have been tyrannized by the forces of Lord Zane for the last few years, with the aid of android Rochester whose memory had been damaged by the crash. After freeing Rochester and restoring his memory, the reluctant Jet is persuaded by Miranda into breaking into Zane's castle and freeing her brother, Prince Carmen . After escaping from the castle, the heroes take the Maxwell  to help Miranda’s father, the King ; he and his people are in a walled city, which is being besieged by Zane’s forces. The heroes win the battle, and the members of the royal family are reunited. Jet is getting ready to leave the planet when Miranda catches up to him and kisses him; as a result, Jet, who had been eager to get away from the planet, is now reluctant to leave.  On the television show, the host thanks the guest and cast members for their work, and starts talking about next week’s show.
