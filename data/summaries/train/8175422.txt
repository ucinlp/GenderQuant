The plot revolves around 16-year-old Ally Hayden , the daughter of a world-famous paleontologist and museum curator . She loves dinosaurs and longs to be able to accompany him to one of the nearby paleontological digs, but her father thinks this is too dangerous and she has to settle for giving museum tours instead. A mysterious accident at the lab revolving an oblong fossil rock happens while Ally's father is away at a dig site with his assistant , and Ally is magically transported back in time. Among the various time periods she visits are the Cretaceous, when the Tyrannosaurus and Pteranodon existed. Ally is also transported to the early 20th Century where she meets renowned historical figures in the world of paleontology. These include dinosaur painter Charles R. Knight  and paleontologist Barnum Brown , arguably one of the most famous paleontogists in early fossil-hunting history. The shining moment of her trip to the past, however, is when Ally discovers a T.Rex nest and then defends the nest from an Ornithomimus, earning the mother T.Rex's respect to the point where Ally actually strokes the T.Rex on its snout before the meteor is shown hitting the earth, blasting Ally back into the present day. There, she is reunited with her father. At the very end, as Ally and her dad leave the museum, the fossil rock begins to shake and, with only the museum cat watching, the rock breaks apart, revealing a still living, baby Tyrannosaurus.
