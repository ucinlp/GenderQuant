A plane crashes in California and a 5-year-old boy survives. Little else is known except the child is an orphan. Susan Chase believes the boy could be hers. Before she was wed to lawyer Bill Chase, she was involved with a Marine during the war, and became suicidal later, putting their child up for adoption. Bill has never been told Susan's secret. Newspaper reporter Phyllis Horn investigates the crash. She, too, has a secret, having given birth after a divorce from husband Bob Duffy, who has since remarried. A third woman, Ann Lawrence, turns up at the crash site. Ann was once a chorus girl, involved with wealthy Gordon Crosley, who spurned her after she became pregnant. Ann shot him and served five years in prison for manslaughter, giving up the baby. The boy appears to be hers, but she believes Susan is better qualified to give the child a good home.
