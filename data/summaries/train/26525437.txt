An old lady, who lives alone in the countryside, is looking forward to death so that she can meet her dead husband. When the Reaper arrives and she is about to reach the afterlife, she is pulled away from the Reaper by a smug doctor. The Reaper and the doctor fight fiercely, and eventually medicine wins. The Reaper leaves, but the lady is not willing to postpone the encounter with her husband, electrocuting herself with the EKG, much to the dismay of the Reaper.
