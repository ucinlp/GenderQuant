The farcical plot of the Warner Bros. release focuses on the unscrupulous Jimmy Corrigan , who runs an agency that searches for heirs of those who have died without leaving a will and often provides phony claimants in order to collect his fee. When his former girlfriend Joan Martin , who left him to due his lack of ethics, accepts a position at the allegedly legitimate firm owned by Charles Wallingham , Corrigan investigates Wallingham's background and discovers his rival is even more duplicitous than he is. He exposes him for the phony he is and promises to go straight if Joan will come back to him.
