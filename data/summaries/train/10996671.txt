Geoffrey learns that German intelligence didn't bring him to Germany for the family reunion when he meets Colonel Hirsch  who insists that he must be aboard for the LZ36 maiden test flight; instead, he becomes involved after the flight tests in a military operation in which Geoffrey will play a key role. He learns the Magna Carta will be stolen with the ship as the means of the operation, and soon becomes torn apart between loyalty to Britain and feelings to Erika.
