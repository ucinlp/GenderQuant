{{Plot}} Wellington is not cheered by his victory. As he surveys the desolate battlefield—which has already attracted looters—he laments, in voice over, that "next to a battle lost, the saddest thing is a battle won". Meanwhile, Napoleon, surrounded by Ney, de la Bedoyère and his marshals, is seen leaving the battlefield in his coach, knowing that this time his days as Emperor really have ended.
