Sadie, the most beautiful yellow lab in the whole wide world, lives an idyllic, pampered life in the suburbs. One day, she comes into heat and has no idea what to do with her new found feelings and urges. When she learns that her loving owners are about to have her spayed, she runs away to the big city where her sexual adventures begin. Among the many characters she meets along the way, she gets seduced by Long Dong Fong , a Shar-pei who rebuffs the male Asian stereotype, Bosco , the big black bad ass Doberman from the other side of the tracks, and Arnold the wiener dog who escorts her to his dark, forbidding dungeon. There’s a sexy girl on girl scene with Fluffy , a Rhodesian ridgeback and the climactic scene with Buster , the labradoodle who fulfills Sadie’s every desire.
