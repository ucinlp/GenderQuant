The Emperor's Minister of State Cheng, an authoritarian ruler, arranges for Hu Lung, one of his old students to distract General Chow while he assassinates the leader of the Ming rebels. Chow hunts for Hu Lung, but must avoid the authorities since he is a suspect in the murder. He eventually finds Chow, but is thwarted by Hu Lung's master, Phillip Ko, and Minister Cheng's hired enforcer, Shen Yu. Shen Yu is hunting for Chow in order to arrest him. Although Shen Yu wants to arrest Chow, he does not kill him, preferring that he goes to court first. This goes against Minister Cheng's orders to kill him. Hu Lung and Chow escape in the ensuing confrontation between Shen Yu and Phillip Ko. Hu Long confesses to his master that he was ordered to kill the rebel leader, and Phillip Co confronts Minister Cheng. Chow learns iron armour and later iron finger. from a young child and his sister to defeat the Invincible Armor technique, but his training is cut short when Shen Yu arrives to arrest him again. He gives Chow three days to clear his name. Minister Chang's plot is eventually exposed, and he is confronted by Chow, Shen Yu, and others.
