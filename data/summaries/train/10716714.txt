Widowed Classics Professor Thomas Bradley  is about to lose his research grant studying ancient love spells. He knows he is close to a major academic breakthrough and desperately needs more time to complete his research. Thomas is given one last chance to finish his work, and goes to the Greek island of Spetses, where he has been invited to stay at the home of a supportive Oxford don Professor Coulter. Thomas brings along his 12 year-old daughter, Serena . The house is in tolerable condition, and Serena finds a book about mermaids that has an ancient Greek inscription on the cover. Serena is supportive of her father and readily asks him about ancient mythology, but feels that he dedicates too much of himself to his work. The pair meet a fisherman named Captain Mavros  and his son Dimitri ; Dimitri develops a crush on Serena. Neried, who can only gain legs at night, travels on land to meet Thomas. When they initially cannot get along, Serena asks that Neried only help her father translate some old relics for his work. Neried does, and when she and Thomas speak the ancient love spell in unison, they fall in love with each other. Thomas realizes that the writing on the book Serena had discovered earlier is the key to understanding all the ancient text, enabling him to continue his work.
