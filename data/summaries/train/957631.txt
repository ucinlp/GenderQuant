Herr Valkirya von Marienblau  governs Tanga, a little island in the Caribbean Sea, the world's biggest tangaine-exporter. Tanga has an area of 49 kmÂ², 18 TV channels, one bookstore  and just one edition of The New York Times. The New York Times is bought every day by Marienblau's nephew, and the dictator does not make a decision without reading it. A communist group wants to take it, and so on, the power.
