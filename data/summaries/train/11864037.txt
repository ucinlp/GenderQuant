Stallion Road is a sweeping romantic melodrama set in the 1940s California pitting a veterinarian  and a romance novelist  in a bid for the affections of a beautiful rancher . Reagan and Smith assume roles that were apparently once earmarked for Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall after their 1946 hit The Big Sleep. A delightfully witty script brings the best out of the stars and Scott shines as the cynical, world weary, but extremely charming novelist. Reagan exerts his usual tough, laconic screen persona which gels nicely with that of the rugged yet endearing rancher played by Smith. The love triangle between Reagan, Smith and Scott is played out with sophistication, wit, humour and heartfelt. Adding to the strengths of the film is a wonderful set of supporting actors. Stallion Road is a melodrama that adheres to the formulas that made this type of film so popular and powerful in the golden age of Hollywood.
