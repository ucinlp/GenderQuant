This Steven Seagal thriller sees Wong Dai , an influential Chinese drug kingpin, sitting at a long table in an old building in Paris, France, going through the motions of a gigantic merger between himself and several other major Chinese drug dealers. Sai Lo  controls shipments in the French heroin market in Paris, using laundromats all over Paris as a front. Tang "The Bird" Zhili  controls the entire New York drug conglomerate from the Chinatown section of New York, and runs Mahjong gambling rackets. Yin Quinshi  of Sofia, Bulgaria, controls an Eastern European drug cartel. Li Bo  controls drug exports in Shanghai, China, and has a penchant for French restaurants. Fang "The Barber" Lee  controls a drug cartel in Paris, France, and he is known to hire unique assassins. And Mr. Chang  controls drug money in London, England. Yale University archaeology professor Robert Burns , who has just recently won the Winthrop Award for excellence in archaeology, stumbles onto the fact that his expedition to China, near the China/Kazakhstan border, is being used by Wong as a cover for a drug smuggling operation. Realizing the danger of sticking around, Burns and his assistant, Luo Yi , make a run for it, but in the resulting gunfight, Yi is killed. When Burns reaches the border, he finds that Wong's smugglers have set him up for smuggling the drugs. Burns lands in a Chinese prison, framed for drug running. Burns is questioned by Chinese narcotics cop Tommie Ling  and DEA agent Ed Gray , who want to release him and use him as bait to nail the drug smugglers. Burns, referred to by the Chinese drug barons as the "gweilo Professor", is quickly released and sent to the USA, where he promises Yi's father Luo Dazhong ([[Vincent Wong  that he will get revenge for Yi's murder, but Wong is not done with Burns yet. Wong sends hitmen to Burns's house in New Haven, Connecticut to plant a bomb, which explodes and kills Burns's wife Maya . With the two people closest to him dead at the hands of Wong and his minions, and with Tommie and Gray shadowing his every move, Burns is out for revenge. As it turns out, Burns was not always a Professor. Burns was once a thief of Chinese artefacts, who served time in prison and earned his archaeology degree while in prison. He changed his name and married Maya after he was released. With his determination to exterminate those who killed Maya, Burns tells Tommie and Gray to stay out of his way, as he cuts a bloody path through Chinatown and across Europe on his way to a confrontation with Wong.
