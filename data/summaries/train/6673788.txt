Bose  is a very patriotic man who fights for the rights of the local market workers against Aatma, the nearby underworld don. Seeing his dedication for helping the working poor, the chief minister  asks him to enter politics. As a politician, he takes charge of a special branch of commandos and destroys Aatma's illegal operations. In retaliation Aatma has Bose's sister falsely implicated in a prostitution case, after which she commits suicide on the court steps. Bose resigns from his position and takes revenge on Aatma. Finally, he returns to his old life at the market.
