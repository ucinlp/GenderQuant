A popular singer named Poodles is coming to town, and everybody is excited. Pooch too is excited but has romantic feelings for the performer as well. Upon seeing his love interest come by in a stage coach, Pooch, on his bicycle, comes up from behind to greet her. At the show which is held at a night club, Poodles sings the jazz song Minnie the Moocher. Still madly in love with her, Pooch tries to approach the singer even on stage. This continued until he was pulled and expelled from the club. Minutes later, Poodles' desperate father comes by to take her for some reason. The singer refuses to go but the father carries her away in the stage coach. Pooch, who is outside, hears her cries for help, and rides to her rescue. On his bike, Pooch chases the stage coach into a tunnel where a scuffle occurs. When they finally come out, the father ends up pulling the coach like a horse. Inside the carriage, Pooch is happy to be with his love interest at last. He and Poodles kiss each other.
