Bob Randall , a war correspondent with a fictional London newspaper, the Gazette, is evacuated with British troops from the beaches of Dunkirk. He writes a hard-hitting story of his experiences, but it is killed by the censor . As London burns in the Blitz, and the newspaper struggles to stay in business, he writes several more eye-witness stories, and then learns of People For Peace, a pacifist organisation. He suspects the members of being Nazi tools and investigates the group. Together with a fellow journalist, Carole Bennett , he finds that his suspicions are correct and that it has already been penetrated by security officers. But when one of the members changes his views and approaches Bennett with a tell-all story, she is kidnapped by the leaders of the group. In a raid by police and security officers, she is freed, but Randall is wounded in a shoot-out. They have their story, but the security officer in charge makes it clear that the incident must remain unpublished â€“ it never happened.
