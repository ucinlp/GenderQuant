{{refimprove}} Nick Persons , a 37-year-old bachelor, takes a car drive on New Year's Eve to Vancouver from Portland, Oregon to transfer two bratty children, Lindsey and Kevin Kingston , to their divorced mother, Suzanne Kingston , on whom Nick has a crush. The road trip seems to be a disaster from the outset, as the three face numerous mishaps. One example includes the children signaling to truck driver Al Buck  that they have been kidnapped by Nick. They are run off the road by him. After Lindsey and Kevin discover their father's betrayal, they warm up to Nick, as he does with them, when he tells them that he, too, was abandoned by his father. Nick and the kids try to hitch a ride from Al Buck, but he leaves Nick behind and drives off, leading to a chase that ends when Nick fights Al, along with several men dressed as snowmen. During the fight, Kevin suddenly gets an asthma attack and Nick rushes to him with the inhaler and is able to revive him. The three eventually arrive at Vancouver. With the consent of the children, Nick and Suzanne are officially dating by the end of the movie.
