The Pink Panther is leisurely walking on the street when he sees a 25Â¢ coin. He picks it up and goes to buy a hotdog, when he changes his mind and goes to buy a hamburger. Confused between the two, he decides to toss the coin and see. The coin falls and rolls away. After many attempts, including climbing 40 floors of a building, jumping a subway turnstile picking up the coin in a bank and fighting with a beggar, the coin lands on wet cement and starts becoming bigger and bigger as it rolls downhill. The Panther then quickly orders a hotdog, and the cemented coin crashes into the vendor's outlet.
