Dear J is about an evangelist, James Jamisin , who must cope with the unexpected death of his agnostic girlfriend: Paige . To sort things out, James admits himself into Logous Psychiatric Institute, where he replays a make-believe Trial in his mind over and over again. The Trial is presided over by a no-nonsense imaginary Judge  and is animated by an array of off-the-wall characters. Some of the witnesses called to the stand are inspired by real-life individuals, like the literary scholar and apologist C.S. Lewis . Throughout the movie, his psychologist, Dr. Frolick  tries to get him to open the letter Paige wrote to him just before her deathâ€”a letter he has been carrying around and refuses to read. Trouble brews when the head of the institute, Dr. Donovin , plans on foiling all attempts to bring James to a resolution.
