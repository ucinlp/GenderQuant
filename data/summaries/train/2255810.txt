The plot is very close to the original play and 1928 movie. Racketeer and mobster Nick Scanlon  has managed to buy several of the local government and law-enforcement officials of a large midwestern American city. However, he can't seem to touch the incorruptible police captain Tom McQuigg , who refuses all attempts at bribery. The cityâ€™s prosecuting attorney, Welch , and a police detective, Turk , are crooked and make McQuigg's job as an honest officer nearly impossible. McQuigg persuades a sexy nightclub singer  to testify against Scanlon which makes her marked for death from the mob. McQuigg not only wants to nail Scanlon, but also stop all the mob corruption in the city -- without getting himself or his witness killed.
