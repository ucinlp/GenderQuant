The film depicts a man, the photographer David, and woman, his Russian girlfriend Katja, who venture into the desert town of Twentynine Palms to search for nature motives for a photo shooting. Katja hardly speaks English and David no Russian so that they have to communicate in French which both speak only a little. As the verbal communication is limited due to the language problems their non-verbal communication is much more intensive. They often get into fights but reconcile by having sex. The sex scenes are clearly shown and filmed naturalistically. One day, both are again out in the desert, they are rammed by a white pickup truck. Three men violently pull them out of the car. One of them rapes David in front of Katja's eyes before they leave. Later in the hotel room David kills Katja with a knife. The film ends with showing a police man who finds David dead in the desert. The film stars Yekaterina Golubeva and David Wissak.
