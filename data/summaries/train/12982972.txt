On his deathbed, Shemp warns Moe and Larry to behave themselves or he will come back and haunt them. After Shemp's arrival to heaven, his Uncle Mortimer  contemplates whether Shemp will remain or go to Hell. Then the Devil  appears in a burst of flame to tempt Shemp with a sultry dancer, Hellen Blazes. Uncle Mortimer intervenes, promising Shemp eternity in Heaven if he returns to Earth unseen and unheard and reforms Moe and Larry. Meanwhile, one "Mr. Heller"  is giving Moe and Larry some "devillishy good ideas," such as conning a wealthy couple into financing the production of fountain pens that write under whipped cream. Shemp sabotages their demonstration but accidentally starts a fire. The scene fades back to Shemp's bedroom. It has all been a dream, but Shemp is on fire because he fell asleep smoking in bed.
