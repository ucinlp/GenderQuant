In a remote wilderness loggers and environmental activists must join together to survive against zombies resulting from a logging company's genetic experiments in an attempt to increase lumber production which will in theory lead to a 15% increase in profit. A lumberjack is injured when cutting a tree which has been spiked by environmentalists. He is infected by genetically modified tree sap, causing him to turn into a zombie.
