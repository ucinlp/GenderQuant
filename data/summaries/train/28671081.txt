Holden Donovan ([[Gregory Smith  is fed up with Principal Donna Weller , who goes to great lengths to stop the students from enjoying their right to free expression, such as expelling Monica Rose for wearing condoms on her outfit to promote safe sex on national "safe sex" day and expels Lawrence Reitzer for kissing another guy in the hallway. Meanwhile, she's running for State Superintendent of all schools, which will give her the power to practice her brand of administration beyond Booker High School. The students have an ally, Mr. Will Druker,  one of their teachers who encourages them to fight for their rights. He pays a price for his position and is fired by Principal Weller. He decides to use his dismissal to make a change of his own, by producing a documentary chronicling the experiences of students who are faced with similar issues. Holden befriends a group of teens, including love interest, Charlotte Pratt , Chuck McGinn , Katie Carmichael , Emily Chua , Lawrence Reitzer , Walanda Jenkins , Kelly Stepford , Monica Rose , and Ashley Harris . Together they organize the student body to take on Principal Weller and make a real change at Booker High.
