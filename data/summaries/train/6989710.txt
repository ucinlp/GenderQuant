He daydreams about a becoming rock star or artist or best-selling author, but fails to follow through with any of his aspirations due to his not wanting to work. He wishes to get back together with his slightly older ex-girlfriend, Susan . She has moved forward with her life, but agrees to a few for a few dates anyway. Billy's German parents, Jurgen Heinlickburger  and Gertrude Heinlickburger , are both eccentric. Jurgen has for 30 years maintained a monotonous diet of Spam sandwiches and raw carrots. Gertrude is simply and totally paranoid about everything. But they both pressure Billy continuely to leave home and get a job. This constant friction forces Billy to decide once and for all if he will change his ways.
