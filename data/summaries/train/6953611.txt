A young girl with telekinetic powers is the focus of a battle between good and evil. Katy Collins  is no ordinary 8 year-old girl. Indeed, she is unique, carrying within her the power of Sateen, an inter-spacial force of immense magnitude. Katy's primary mission on earth is to carry these genes forward, a task accomplished by convincing her mother, Barbara  to bear a similarly endowed male child with whom Katy would eventually mate.
