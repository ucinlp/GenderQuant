The difference between social classes provides the basis for this comedy. The trouble begins when a drunken sot wanders into the fancy home of a woman who is hosting a gala dinner. Mr. and Mrs. Tidmarsh , a middle-class English couple, are giving a dinner party in honour of their wealthy uncle, Gabriel Gilwattle , hoping to receive his financial aid in their struggle to keep up appearances. Mrs. Tidmarsh had invited 13 guests, as a result of regrets, and Gabriel is superstitious. To offset this, she hires Blankely's, a professional company, to send her a sophisticated 14th guest, sight unseen. Further cancellations obviate this necessity, and Margery Seaton , their governess, is invited; but the "hired guest" arrives anyhow and is announced as Lord Strathpeffer . Naturally Mrs. Tidmarsh mistakes the drunk for the hired guest and invites him to dine. Mayhem ensues. Margery recognizes the tipsy man as a former lover, and he is assumed to be an impostor. Sobering, Strathpeffer realizes he has come to the wrong party and asserts his right to his title; but Gwennie  hides her father's watch in Strathpeffer's pocket as he is renewing his romance with Margery. A police inspector arrives hunting for the missing lord, establishing his authenticity and the fact that he is not, after all, the hired guest.
