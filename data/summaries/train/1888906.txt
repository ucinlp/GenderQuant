Set in an unnamed coastal city in Italy, the movie tells a story of an American girl, Nancy  who, after a rape attempt, takes shelter in a villa where strange guests go around. There she gets into a relationship with a retired pimp, Alex . Nancy's adventures have been paralleled to those of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, although turned into erotic ones. Critics have also pointed out the movie's lack of connectiveness and the excessive absurdity of several situations.
