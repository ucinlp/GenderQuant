At a pickup baseball game, Reuven meets Danny Saunders, another Jewish teenage boy, who is the son of a strict Hasidic Rebbe. At first, the meeting is one of enmity. However, both boys go on to form an unlikely friendship. Their complicated friendship is strained by historical events such as the Holocaust and the creation of the State of Israel.
