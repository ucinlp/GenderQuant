Vijay, having grown up in the United States, has no interest in marriage. His goal is to enjoy his youth as much as possible. His father, distraught at Vijay's ways, seeks to marry him off to make him more responsible. His insistence makes Vijay agree to a marriage but with a unique condition &mdash; a kind of a test drive! The marriage will be for a single year, initially, and at the end of the year he can choose to continue it, or not, depending on his attitude towards his wife. His father picks Priya, who is his personal assistant. She agrees to the condition because of problems plaguing her family. Unmoved by her devotion to him, Vijay opts to get out of the marriage after the year is over. Soon, though, he realizes her worth and wants her to come back. But now it's her turn to say "no".
