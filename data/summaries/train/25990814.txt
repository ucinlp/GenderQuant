 Belle owns and works at her music and bookstore in France. A group of children walk into the store eager to hear Belle's stories, as she is noted to be a great storyteller. Belle agrees to tell a story, but the gang also play games and learn some simple lessons about life. Belle narrates two classic Disney cartoons, The Three Little Pigs and Peter and the Wolf, while the children help Belle clean the bookstore. She also reads The Wise Little Hen and Morris the Midget Moose, but Shawn and Harmony will not help make chili for the group. Along the way, Belle adds music and interacts with the children.  At the end of the film, an episode planned for a Beauty and the Beast television show premiered at the end titled Mrs. Pott's Party. In animation, Belle decides to throw a party for Mrs. Potts, who has been feeling depressed recently at the castle. Lumiere and Cogsworth attempt to help Belle, but they cannot decide on which flowers or cake to use, leading to rivalry. They later try to sabotage each other's attempts. Belle teaches the household objects that friendship is very important and the two patch up their differences. Mrs. Potts' party is a success and she is not depressed anymore. This animated short was released in 2003 as a part of Belle's Magical World. The episodes in that film were also from the same television show that was later scrapped.
