Caramel revolves around the intersecting lives of five Lebanese women. Layale  works in a beauty salon in Beirut along with two other women, Nisrine  and Rima . Each one has a problem: Layale is stuck in a dead-end relationship with a married man; Nisrine is no longer a virgin but is set to be married and in her conservative family where pre-marital sex is not accepted; Rima is attracted to women; Jamale , a regular customer and wannabe actress, is worried about getting old; Rose , a tailoress with a shop next to the salon, is an old woman who had devoted her life to taking care of her mentally unbalanced elder sister Lili , but has found her first love. The film doesn't refer to any of the political problems or recent warfare that has troubled Lebanon. Rather, Labaki's tale paints everyday people with everyday problems.
