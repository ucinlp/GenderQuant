Tony Rome, an ex-cop turned private investigator, lives on a powerboat in Miami. He is asked by his former partner, Ralph Turpin , to take home a young woman who had been left unconscious in a hotel room. The woman, Diana  Pines , is the daughter of rich construction magnate Rudolph Kosterman , who subsequently hires Rome to find out why his daughter is acting so irrationally. Diana, after regaining consciousness, discovers that a diamond brooch, which she had been wearing the night before, has gone missing. Diana and her stepmother  also hire Rome, in this instance, to find the lost brooch. This, however, leads Rome into a maze of trouble, all the while being hired and counter-hired by Kosterman, his daughter, and his wife.
