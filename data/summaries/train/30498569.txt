Leo, the main character, is a Holocaust survivor who suffers from total amnesia. When he immigrates to the U.S. he manages to find a job as a hotel desk clerk. When he accepts a drink in the hotel bar, he suddenly starts singing, amazing those around him—and himself—with his magnificent voice. Taking advantage of his gift, he begins singing in nightclubs. Eventually, with the help of a psychiatrist and partly as a result of a blow to the head during a mugging, his memories begin to return, and he realizes that he is the son of a great Jewish Hazzan  in Europe. As memories of his parents, who perished in the Holocaust, return to him, he abandons his nightclub career to follow his father's footsteps as a synagogue cantor.Shandler, Jeffrey [http://books.google.com/books?idPA42&lpgsinging+in+the+dark+oysher&sourceNOUEOGw1Qc&sigen&eiX&oiresult&resnum0CCYQ6AEwAzgU#vsinging%20in%20the%20dark%20oysher&f"shandler"/>
