A small group of terrorists have seized the British ambassador to the fictitious country of "Scandinavia", and are holding him hostage in his residence. Scandinavia's head of security, Col. Nils Tahlvik , wants to take an uncompromising position, but he is overruled by the governments of both Scandinavia and Britain, who insist that all of the terrorist's demands be met. A passenger airplane arriving at the airport of Scandinavia's capital city is hijacked by another small group of  terrorists, led by Ray Petrie . The airplane ends up parked on an isolated taxiway, and Petrie demands that he be put in touch with Martin Shepherd , leader of the group holding the British ambassador hostage. Petrie, who is known by Shepherd, convinces Shepherd that his group and his hostages should leave on the hijacked airplane, not on a military plane as originally planned. Tahlvik and his group of military commandos make several attempts to thwart the terrorists' plans, but nothing seems to work out for them. At the last minute, Tahlvik figures out that the "terrorists" on the airplane are actually British secret operatives intent on capturing Martin Shepherd, and that the British officials have been misleading the Scandinavian authorities and undermining Tahlvik's efforts to capture the two terrorist groups. He boards the airplane alone just before it is to take off, precipitating a shootout between the two groups that leaves Shepherd and his group dead.
