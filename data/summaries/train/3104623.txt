Nicholas Urfe is a young Englishman who has taken a teaching position on the Greek island of Phraxos following the previous instructor's suicide. For Nicholas it is a chance for different surroundings, and it is also an attempt to escape his relationship with his emotionally unstable lover, Anne. At first Nicholas' life on Phraxos is uneventful but peaceful. He soon becomes intrigued with a reclusive man named Maurice Conchis, who owns an estate on the opposite side of island and has a beautiful young woman named Lily as a companion. Immediately upon being introduced to the couple, Nicholas' life begins to unravel. He tries to find out who the mysterious Conchis really is. Is he a psychiatrist? A film producer? A Nazi sympathizer? Or is he a magician who controls the lives and destinies of those around him? Nicholas quickly begins to lose his grip on reality as he sinks further and further into Conchis' game. During visits to Conchis's estate, Nicholas has a series of experiences which gradually become more unexpected and bizarre. Many are related to  past events from Conchis's life. Ultimately, these events begin happening off the estate as well, at unexpected times and places, raising questions as to how much power and control Conchis can actually exercise over others' lives. The story climaxes with a "trial" directed by Conchis with Nicholas  participating. The final scene (which may be interpreted almost as a coda has to do with Nicholas' relationship with Anne and whether or not it continues.
