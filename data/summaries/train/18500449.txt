Édouard and Caroline are preparing for a family evening during which Édouard will be expected to play the piano. Lacking a dinner jacket Édouard goes to borrow one from his wife's cousin. In the meantime Caroline attempts to re-model her dress to bring it more up-to-date. Her husband is not pleased and the evening consists of rows, fights and threats of divorce. It is the early morning before life returns to normal.
