Arthur  visits Mary  to profess his love and propose to her. But when he notices her earrings, he begins to rape her and winds up choking her to death. His mother  is worried and asks her police detective brother-in-law Bill  to help find him. Meanwhile, Mary has been found dead, the police suspect Arthur and the radio informs the public about the apparent murder. In the course of his investigation, Bill finds several women who tell of Arthur's surprising rapes  while they are graphically shown in flashbacks. Each one has a different character: One is a violent rape scene, one victim  turns the rape into lovemaking, another  victim is so repelled that she vomits afterwards. Only the viewer gets to see the connection however, the glistening earrings each victim wears, and which set Arthur off. The story finally is explained to Bill by Dr. Meade  who a couple of months ago performed a penis transplant on Arthur which may have also transplanted the former womanizing owner's fondness of golden earrings...
