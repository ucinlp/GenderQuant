Lucky Kapoor  lives in Australia and has no interest in taking over his father's business in India. Saba Karim Khan  has a great interest in the property, but Mr. Kapoor has no interest in selling the business to Khan. So Khan has Mr. Kapoor killed, making it look like an accident. Jessica Periera , a childhood sweetheart of Lucky, has proof that Mr. Kapoor's death was not an accident--but she keeps it to herself. When Karim Khan meets with Lucky to renegotiate, he finds that Lucky is willing to sell--but he also discovers that Lucky bears a striking resemblance to Karim Khan's own dead son. Although Karim Khan will do anything to make Lucky heir to his own wealth and properties, Lucky is not willing to do so.
