The film tells two parallel stories, one about the life of a street vendor  following the death of his father; the other about a woman he meets briefly  as she heads off on a trip of uncertain duration to Paris. Lee's character, who sells watches on the streets of Taipei, sells his own watch to Chen and then finds himself overcome by a desire to set every clock he sees to Paris time. Jean-Pierre Léaud, the lead actor in François Truffaut's The 400 Blows, has a cameo appearance in this film.
