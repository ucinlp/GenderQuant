A few months ago Dan had to make a choice. Go to Geneva with his parents for a year, board at school or move into a house with his uni student bass-playing aunt, Jacq, and her friend, Naomi. He picked Jacq's place. Now he's doing his last year at school and trying not to spin out. Trying to be cool. Trying to pick up a few skills for surviving in the adult world. Problem is, he falls for Naomi, and things become much, much more confusing. As Dan fumbles through the process of forming a relationship with someone of the opposite sex, he also learns about making pesto, interpreting the fish tank scene from Romeo and Juliet, why almost all birds are one of the 48 shades of brown, and why his best course of action is just to be himself.  48 Shades took $193,230 at the box office in Australia.Film Victoria - Australian Films at the Australian Box Office.
