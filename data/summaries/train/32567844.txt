{{expand section}} In an old house next to an apartment complex in Thailand, a man is bitten to death by a snake. The special services and the media congregate but are only able to find a few snakes. Later, a group of cobras invade the building which threatens the lives of the habitants: a young landlady Panin , her aunt Pai  who has set up a snake shrine, Panin's doctor ex-boyfriend Sadayu , his younger brother Vick , snake specialist Chai , airline stewardess Jan , three rock musicians, three teenagers, plus two-timing husband Ponnapa , his wife Mon  and their young daughter Kij . Along with them is a TV reporter Paai  who is secretly sending out clips of the gory events through her mobile phone.
