The Stooges awake in the middle of the night to a crying baby left on their doorstep. A letter from the despondent mother  states that baby Jimmie  has been "abandoned". The Stooges react by taking the little guy in, feeding him, and trying their best to act fatherly. Later, Larry finds a newspaper article stating a child kidnapping, and the Stooges believe that Jimmie is the child and the kidnappers left a phony note. When the mother and two motorcycle cops come to reclaim the baby, the Stooges evacuate their home quickly, with Jimmie in tow; unbeknownst to the stooges Jimmie crawled into the back seat of their car. The police on their motorcycles track them down and the baby is returned to the parents who, the father being one of the cops, reconcile. The Stooges, meanwhile, make a conspicuous escape by skittering away hidden in large haystacks.
