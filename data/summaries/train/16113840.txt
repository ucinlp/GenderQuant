A self-sufficient stubborn independent blind woman named Alexandra McKay , who has been blind for over 20 years, finally agrees to acquire a guide dog. She is worried that people will try to get close to her out of pity, so she distances herself emotionally from everyone, but becomes attached to her seeing-eye Labrador Retriever companion, Emma. She meets Richard Chapman, who eventually becomes her boyfriend, and the new romance begins to pull Alexandra out of her shell. When the opportunity arises for a delicate operation that may restore her sight, Alexandra is alternately elated and scared. Richard convinces Alaxandra to attempt the operation.
