Goal Dreams is about personal and national identity as seen through a football team like no other. With players of multiple nationalities, speaking different languages and without a home field, the Palestine national football team and its players must overcome obstacles of a physical, emotional, cultural and geographic nature just to exist. The film chronicles the lives of four Palestinian players hailing from different parts of the world during the team's preparation for their most important World Cup 2006 qualification match.
