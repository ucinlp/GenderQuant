There is no real plot to these documentaries. Much like its three predecessors, Faces of Death IV provides over 50 gory scenes of dying, murder, accidents, police brutality, execution, cult rituals, and other macabre events. Some of these include a bungee jumping trip gone awry, a magician's fatal mishap with a Houdini trick, a mechanic who has his left leg severed by a falling Corvette, a Satanic ritual that ends in the death of several, a cocaine dealer's fatal wedding, and more. John Alan Schwartz cameos yet again as an ambulance driver. The earlier films in the series were of a more serious nature and tone, whereas this installment leans more toward camp: "Dr. Louis Flellis" sits at his desk in front of a glowing red lava lamp, with a plastic skeletal foot on the desk in front of him during introductions to most sequences. Flellis is also shown eating a plate of barbecue ribs immediately before showing slaughterhouse footage.
