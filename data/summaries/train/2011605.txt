 It is the story of an ex con, Simon  who after returning to Iceland, where his mother was born visit relatives, but actually he is looking for the loneliest place in the world to commit suicide. In a small village he met Dúa , an Icelandic young lady, who is found to be an interesting, rather strange woman by Simon. Dúa has a caged falcon that she hopes to tame, but they get into trouble as it is illegal to possess this kind of animal in captivity. In the story Simon is the embodiment of a jailed bird, one of the falcons and as she is an air sign, they join in a relationship ruled by Simon’s belief that she is his illegitimate daughter. Surrounded by tension between them, Simon serves as a protective figure to Dúa, who keeps him from committing suicide. The couple escape to Hamburg, Germany to start all over again. The protagonists’ behaviours are opposite to each other: Simon is down to earth and find himself awkward by Dúa’s eccentric beliefs in astrology, who considers Simon as a typical Scorpio and thus avoid deepening into a more serious relationship, partly because of the feeling of his paternity. Dúa’s falcon, that she nourished and protected when her uncle found it with a broken wing, has a high value to her, as she considers it as the last remnant of the beloved life in Iceland. The falcon travels with them on their escape and has a high monetary value. Later, as Dúa wasted their money, Simon tries to sell the falcon in order to cover with their expenditures, but he is cheated by some crooked Germans and the falcon is stolen.
