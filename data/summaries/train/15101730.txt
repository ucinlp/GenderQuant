The story starts with Divakaram  coming late to video-shoot a marriage, where he sees Bhuvaneswari and falls head over heels in love. He then gets a hold of Bhuvaneswari's maternal uncle VP Jagannadham  and gets information about Bhuvaneswari. He gathers that she respects only the people who are self-sufficient and straightforward. He also finds out that she is not married and is about to get transferred to Rajamundry  soon. She works as a railway booking clerk.
