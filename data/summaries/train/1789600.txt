The Technirama film tells the story of Marc Revere, an American TV singer of Italian heritage who travels to Italy in search of his jet-setting fianc√©e, Carol Ralston, played by Peggie Castle. Revere moves in with his comical and good hearted cousin Pepe Bonelli , a struggling artist who also befriends a beautiful young girl, Raffaella Marini , whom Revere had met on a train. Like Lanza, this was Allasio's next-to-last film , as she would marry Count Pierfrancesco Calvi di Bergolo, grandson of King Victor Emmanuel III, King of Italy, in November 1958 and retire from the cinema.
