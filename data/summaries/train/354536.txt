After the killing of his father , by a mysterious assassin, Count Downe  is summoned from his travels abroad by family advisor Merlin  in order to prepare him to take over the throne. Baron Frankenstein  is also on hand to help in any way he can. Problem is, Downe wants no part of this responsibility, and instead wishes to become human and mortal âˆ’ especially after meeting a girl named Amber , with whom he falls in love. He approaches old family nemesis Dr Van Helsing , who agrees to enable the Count's transformation, much to the dismay of the residents of the Underworld. Despite the best efforts of a host of monsters, as well as one traitorous figure who is dealt with by the trusted Merlin, Van Helsing performs the operation and removes Downe's fangs. He then informs the Count that he can now live out his days in the sunlight, with Amber at his side.
