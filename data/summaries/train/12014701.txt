The film opens with a scene where fiery criminal lawyer Meera is being gang-raped to put a rapist behind bars, but the judge rules against her. Though the rapist walks free, is there a power who can save him from the justice of the “Billi” &mdash; a shadowy figure dressed in a black cat-suit who has taken to the streets at night rounding up all scum and sleaze and dishing out her own brand of justice to chilling effect. There is an earnest police office  determined to nab the cat but he does not appear to be making much headway as this cat appears to have at least nine lives. In her brutal quest for justice she does not even spare the lawyer representing the rapist who was basically just doing his job. She corners him one dark, stormy night and hacks off his tongue so he can never twist a case to his benefit as he had done with the rape case. Uthba tries to marry Meera but she manages to castrate him. Twists are revealed in a typically dramatic scenes.
