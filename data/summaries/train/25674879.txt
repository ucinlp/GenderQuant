Daffy runs a diner near Guadalajara, serving mouseburgers with rubber mice as substitutes for actual mice, as he hasn't seen one in ages. However, one angry cat discovers the trick and demands a real mouseburger. So by gunpoint, Daffy go to find a mouse. At this point, Daffy encounters Speedy, who he tries to cook. The mouse discovers his intentions and escapes to the desert, with Daffy in hot pursuit. Daffy is foiled each time by Speedy running up a cactus, Daffy accidentally knocking a cactus on himself, and being scared by Speedy into a trash can . Finally, the cat demands his burger within two minutes, forcing Daffy to disguise himself as a mouse. He states, "You never know what you can do until you have a gun pointed at your head", the same line used in Golden Yeggs.
