Tony de Guzman is an anti-hero. Life, according to him, is short, brutal and is never on your side. Grab what you can, when you can. Settle scores. Be randy. Defy the rules. Cheat the system. Tough it out. Tony knows nothing but tough times living, as he does, in the bleak circus of the slums he calls home amongst denizens of the underworld: the crippled pimp, the lonely housewife, the neighborhood gay and his macho father, the prostitutes, the small-time politician, and the Yankee pedophile. This is his story and the story of the world he lives in: a hopeless, closed-in decrepit world gone to seed. Mondomanila is an unflinching and unflinchingly funny look at life in the underbelly of the urban diasporaâ€”-with songs.
