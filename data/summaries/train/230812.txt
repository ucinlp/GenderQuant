This short showcases Pluto as a soldier. Pluto is a guard dog on a military base. He's told there are saboteurs, and is assigned to guard a pill-box . First, Pluto tries to follow marching orders, contorting himself into quite a mess. Then, he engages in hijinks with two chipmunks who are using a cannon to store and crack their nuts, and a war of wits naturally ensues.
