The film focuses on four young ladies from different social backgrounds and each for their own various reasons, enlists in the fictional "Miss Manila Sunshine Beauty Pageant". The first of which is Dina , a college student who entered the contest in order to earn independence from her family. Next is spoiled, rich socialite, Suzanne , whose every whim is attended to by her maid, Maria , and who learned of the contest when fliers, dropped from a helicopter, interrupt her sunbathing at the family pool. Out of sheer vanity she decided to sign up. Thirdly, Bambi , while planning her 18th birthday party, when she and her mother argue over the budget, since her once rich family cannot afford the grand debut, Bambi is forced to settle for a much simpler party. But during their argument, Bambi falls on her birthday cake; when she sees the pageant's TV spot, her frustrations over her current situation inspire her to join. Rounding up the group is Azenith , a con-artist who plans to rig the contest by using her and her boyfriend's sexuality to influence the judges into voting for her. The ladies later became the finalists for the competition. En route to the evening gown competition, the ship they boarded catches fire, and the passengers scramble to evacuate. The four women, Maria, Joshua  and his boyfriend Ricardo , Umberto  and Alfredo  land on a desert island.
