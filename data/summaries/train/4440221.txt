It is the end of the semester and Logan's father invites them to his house. When Logan's father says that there is going to be a competition vs the boys and the girls, he gives them Tekmates. Who ever wins the competition will be on his show Gender Defenders, so the teams pick their own team leader. Chase is the leader for the boys and Zoey is the leader for the girls. Before the competition, Quinn makes an energy drink that is not ready yet and Dustin drinks it without Quinn knowing at first until he went crazy. In the middle of the competition, Chase sent a message to Michael saying that he does not want to tell Zoey that he loves her. But, by accident, he sent it to Zoey. He gets the Tekmate from her and deletes the message. When he tries to give it back to her, she is gone. When she finds out, she gets mad. The girls end up winning but Logan's father says that there were hidden cameras so they were all on the show. When they go back to PCA, Zoey asked Chase what the message was. Michael, Logan, Quinn and Lola call them to watch the show on TV. Dustin then stops going crazy. In the end, Chase writes the message on his Tekmate to Zoey, but realizes it is not with her. The last scene shows Zoey's Tekmate, which she left by a fountain, vibrating into the water and therefore impeding her from seeing it.
