How Is Your Fish Today? tells the story of a famous screenwriter  whose film scripts have all been rejected by Chinese censors. He writes a script about a man named Lin Hao  for his producer, who expects it to be a Chinese version of The Fugitive. Upon reading Rao's arthouse script, the producer rejects it as the worst screenplay he has ever read. Rao is infuriated with the response and kills Lin's wife. Lin finds out while cheating on his wife and immediately sends Rao a thank you note. Rao is upset that Lin did not get adequately infuriated and kills all of Lin's dogs. Lin then calls in three Nazis he knew from back in the day to poop all over Rao's lawn. Rao is discouraged and now sees his mistake. However, Rao does not abandon his story, instead he rewrites it. Rao begins to live through his main character, Lin Hao, as he writes about him fleeing his home on a journey of self-discovery. Hao makes his way to Mohe, as does Rao, and the writer enters his own narrative. Both characters, in a struggle for freedom, have left their homes behind, but while Lin Hao is running away, Hui Rao is searching for something.
