The cartoon opens with a circus featuring "Gracie, the Fightin' Kangaroo!". Gracie has a baby  while practicing, and isn't able to stay with him very long. While Gracie goes off to perform, Hippety slips on a pair of his mother's boxing gloves, and wanders off . Meanwhile, Sylvester is bragging to his son about how he took on a mouse about his own size. Unfortunately, Hippety shows up behind him, leading Sylvester into a panic. Junior urges Sylvester to fight Hippety, as they both think he's a giant mouse, and says that if he doesn't, he'll "disillusion a child's faith in his father." The result is a fight between Hippety and Sylvester. Hippety wins at first, but then Sylvester chases him off with an axe. Along the way, they pass the workman, who treads in his own cement as if daring the participants in the chase to do the same â€“ but when they do not, he stands in the center of the sidewalk and plays "Taps" on a trumpet as he sinks. Sylvester is led to the circus, and right when Junior enters his sight, he starts gloating again . After gloating, Sylvester says he wished Hippety was twice as big, with 4 arms and 2 heads. Ironically, Gracie comes out with Hippety in her pouch, causing both the cats to run off. Hippety gives them a friendly wave good-bye, and the cartoon closes.
