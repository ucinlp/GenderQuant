In an East Frisian farm, Bohlen was born. Since he was young, he had a weakness with young women and music. His father taught him that he always had to reach the top. Bohlen played in many bands during his adolescence and was incredibly popular with the girls. After becoming an adult, started working as a producer in a record company. His friend Andy created the Formula "Haste Geld - haste Autos - haste Frauen" as a way to success. Bohlen started working to get the money by producing a lot of singers - without success. Finally, he met the singer Thomas Anders and founded the band Modern Talking, which achieved success through all the world. But Anders' wife, Nora Balling, interfered more and more in the band's subjects, provoking the band's split. After the band's split, Bohlen met Naddel, then he fell in love with her, particularly because of her big, but false breasts. They then went to a bigger house. But later, Bohlen met Verona, and he fell in love with her too. He broke up with Nadel and he married Verona, but just because of convenience, because Verona can divorce and receive a million German marks. Bohlen fell into desperation, and he wanted to reunite Modern Talking. The success came back again. He had just three options to continue with: Wolfgang Petry, Thomas Anders or himself. He decided to go with himself, and he united again with Verona.
