Shiva  is blessed with magical snake-charming powers. When he meets Paro  from a nearby village, he falls head-over-heels in love with her. She is also attracted to him. But Paro's father, Choudhry Charanjit Singh, is not pleased with this match, and he hires men to subdue and kill Shiva, all in vain. Then Shiva attempts to rescue Paro from a shapeshifting snake, and this earns him the wrath of his mate - another shapeshifting snake, who will not rest until Shiva is dead.
