The central figure of the film is represented by a mysterious figure called "Gaja Gamini" , who inspires, arouses, and confuses the common man. "Gaja Gamini" is the inspiration behind Leonardo Da Vinci's  'Mona Lisa', Kalidas' poem "Shakuntala", and a photojournalist named Shahrukh's  photographs. The mysterious "Gaja Gamini" appears as four characters, one of them being Sangeeta, a blind girl from Banaras at the beginning of time, who inspires village women  to revolt against a male-dominated system and carve a niche for women forever. Another character is Shakuntala, who is the subject of Kalidas' poem of the same name. Shakuntala incites jealousy in the women and love in the men around her, charming humans and animals alike in the forests of Kerala. "Gaja Gamini" is also Mona Lisa during the Renaissance, the object of painter Leonardo Da Vinci's obsession. Finally, Monika, the most confusing sector of the film, is supposed to represent the woman of the New Millennium. Kamdev, the God of Love , walks the earth throughout history, attempting to win the love of "Gaja Gamini". Thrown into this mix is a large black wall, separating two different time periods, and confrontations between Science  and Art  at different points in history, showing that the world itself can change, but its original ideas will always be the same. For example, a play by Shakespeare written and performed by actors in the 15th Century will still be performed in the 21st Century, but with different actors. The confrontations between Art and Science also bring about the idea that while Science is firmly set on believing that which can only be proved, the basis for Art is that which can be proved, and an intuitive sense that can be felt. Science uses the brain, while Art uses the brain and the heart. Another interesting facet of the film is a "gathri", a small bundle which a woman carries upon her head, like a burden, with which she must walk forever.The Paradox of Progress II: Gaja GaminiGaja Gamini Yahoo!
