A decade earlier, Jonesport, Maine preacher Seth Parker and his wife offered shelter to runaway Robbie Turner, who as an infant was abandoned by his sadistic, alcoholic father Rufe. Mary Lucy Duffy, who has been banished from her home by her father for fraternizing with farm hand David Clark, is living with the Parkers as well, and her romance with David attracts the attention of the local gossips. Years earlier, David's mother Rose had run off with a stranger, and when she and her illegitimate infant son returned to Jonesport, they were shunned by the townspeople. Mary Lucy and David plan to elope to Bangor, but Seth encourages them to stay by offering to pay for a proper wedding. Rufe breaks into the Parker home to kidnap Robbie and attacks Mary Lucy when she tries to protect the boy. Seth pursues Rufe and Robbie and manages to intercept them before they board a train. Because Seth is not Robbie's legal guardian, the boy is placed in an orphanage, where he awaits a decision about his future. Meanwhile, Seth lectures the townspeople on the subject of tolerance and implores them to accept Rose and her newlywed son and his bride. Robbie returns to Jonesport, having been legally entrusted to the care of the Parkers.
