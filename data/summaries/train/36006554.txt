The film talks about two individuals and their destiny. It shows the loss of utopia and the struggle of ideologies in Cuba: Ricardo Martínez is a former rebel of Fidel Castro. Together with Che Guevara he has founded the Pirate radio Radio Rebelde that became the main revolutionary voice of Cuba. The younger Cuban generation listens to Radio y Televisión Martí that broadcasts from Miami, Florida. Miriam represents this younger generation. By comparing this to radio stations, the film is as well about media history.
