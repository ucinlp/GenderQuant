British author W.W. Jacobs, whose love of the sea and seafarers permeated everything he wrote, was responsible for the story upon which Beauty and the Barge was based. Ethel Smedley  plays the headstrong daughter of an Army officer who runs away from home. She is later adopted by Captain Barley, the bargeman Gordon Harker. A very young Jack Hawkins portrays a handsome Lieutenant Seton Boyne  who signs on as a common seaman on Harker's barge in hopes of winning Hawkins' love. Beauty and the Barge also features the unforgettable Margaret Rutherford as Mrs. Baldwin, doing pretty much what she'd been still doing in movies nearly thirty years later-shamelessly stealing every scene she's in.http://www.allmovie.com/work/beauty-and-the-barge-84617
