This film follows the lead character, Alexander Hell, played by Shaw, as he rides his Harley Davidson motorcycle out from the dark abyss to battle samurai sword carrying Vampires who are unleashing their vengeance on modern day Hollywood, California. Once on earth, Hell joins forces with an ancient Asian vampire, Sir Katana who is played by Kenneth H. Kim. This film is one of Scott Shaw's early directorial works. Nonetheless, this film shows the direction of abstract filmmaking Shaw has continued into his later feature films: *The film follows a non-linear storyline. *It contains many music video style references where the central characters leave behind the storyline and interact solely by the presentation of visual images in association with techno music. *It is divided by unexpected edits. *The film is considered a "Zen film," as part of a distinct style of filmmaking formulated by Scott Shaw in which no scripts or screenplays are used.
