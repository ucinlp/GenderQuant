Harry McKenzie works in a factory by day and comes home to comfortable marriage at night, but it lacks excitement and passion. For his 50th birthday, his wife Kate blithely tells him to just go to his favorite corner tavern and have a good time. An attractive barmaid, Audrey Minelli, captures his interest. Harry falls for her and, before long, shocks Kate by requesting a divorce. This horrifies their daughters, particularly Sunny, who is having a difficult marriage of her own, and Helen, who is about to be wed. Kate goes through a difficult period of adjustment. She eventually lands a job in a beauty salon, changes her appearance and tries to adopt a new outlook on life. But by the time Harry brings Audrey to his daughter Helen's wedding, old wounds open up that continue to keep the family members apart.
