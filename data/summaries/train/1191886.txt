An elderly janitor named Harlan Williams is caught up in an explosion at the laboratory he works at. He survives but discovers he is now aging in reverse. He ends up on the run from an operative of "The Shop". The Shop is a quasi-government agency that has appeared or is mentioned in a number of Stephen King's books as well as adaptations, most prominently in Firestarter, as well as The Tommyknockers, Carrie and the film adaptation of The Lawnmower Man.  The theme song of the show is "Golden Years" by David Bowie. Stephen King has a cameo as a bus driver. The original televised series never finished, as the eighth and final episode did not air. The show was left on a cliffhanger, which was not fully resolved when it came out on video. Instead, the producers changed what had happened in the last minutes of the seventh episode and made that the final installment.
