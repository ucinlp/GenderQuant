A haughty anthropology professor named Harry Ballard  receives a sinister videotape showing a cult called the Black Lodge ranting about some kind of demonic plot. As it turns out, Harry's brother, Richard, killed himself a few months earlier under mysterious circumstances, possibly related to this cult; in any event, the loss has been preying on Harry's mind, sending his relationship with his girlfriend  into a tailspin. Meanwhile a seemingly schizophrenic young woman named Bennie , who has a penchant for lighting sparklers in alleyways for no good reason, follows Harry around and snatches him from the jaws of doom after he falls into the cult's hands. The devilish leader, Le Valliant , apparently has big plans in store for Harry, and soon the protagonist's grip on reality slips as the cult targets him for an upcoming ritual.
