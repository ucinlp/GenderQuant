A nostalgic journey through 1950s Bombay with its quiet, peaceful and scenic background, electric trams, and a unique taxi driver, Mangal, who is called "Hero" by his friends. A driver who drives a cab by day, then drinks at night, listens to the seductive club dancer Sylvie, and then goes into a drunken stupor - and wakes up with a hangover. One day, while assisting another taxi driver, Mangal comes to the assistance of a damsel in distress Mala, who is being molested by two thugs. Mangal gallantly rescues her, and attempts to take her to her destination, but to no avail, as the person she is looking for has moved. The next day, Mangal and the young woman, Mala, again attempt to seek Ratanlal, a music director, but the entire day is spent in vain. Mala lives in Mangal's tiny apartment and both become attracted to each other. When Mala finds out about Sylvie, she leaves him. He goes in her search, but finds that she has become a famous singer with the help of her music director friend. Will Mangal ever get a chance to tell about his love for Mala? What will Sylvie's reaction be?
