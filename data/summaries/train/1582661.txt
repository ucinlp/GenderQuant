In 17th-century Paris, a dashing swordsman named D'Artagnan finds himself at odds with the powerful forces taking over France. He sets out to avenge the murder of his parents and finds his country cleaved by chaos and civil unrest. His heart softens only for Francesca , a fiery peasant girl who claims D'Artagnan's heart on sight. D'Artagnan , after witnessing his unarmed parents slain by the evil Febre , grows up wanting to be a musketeer, one of King Louis XIII's loyal protectors. Upon arriving in Paris, however, he finds that the Musketeers have been disbanded by order of Cardinal Richelieu , who is usurping the king's authority with the help of his lethal henchman, Febre. Traveling to Paris, D'Artagnan verbally spars with witless quip-spouting musketeers Aramis , Athos  and Porthos . D'Artagnan heads off guarding the queen, who is traveling incognito as a commoner on her way to meet Lord Buckingham. The evil Febre, his leash held loosely by the evil Cardinal Richilieu , wants to kill the Queen  in order to sow unrest and war, which would create opportunities to profit, a war between France and England.
