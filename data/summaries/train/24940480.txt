The film opens with Karen , a traumatised woman, having a horrific nightmare involving a subway train. The flashback narrative plot follows her trapped in a subway. A Christian doomsday cult, which has been consuming and distributing hallucinogen-laced muffins that make people see visions of demons, begins massacring non-believers through the city, believing it is their mission to "save" the souls of humanity for God, which can only be accomplished by killing people with swords and daggers. A group of surviving train passengers and subway workers try to fight off and escape the cultists, but die one by one, leaving only Karen and two other people alive when the cultists are signaled to commit a mass suicide.
