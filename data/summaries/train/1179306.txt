The story centers on world-renowned film maker John Wilson , who travels to Africa for his next film bringing with him a young writer chum named Pete Verrill . While there he becomes obsessed with hunting elephants while neglecting the preparations for the film. This leads to a conflict between the men on several levels, most notably over the idea of killing for sport such a grand animal. Even Wilson concedes that it is so wrong that it is not just a crime against nature, but a "sin." Yet he cannot overcome his desire to bring down a giant bull, a "tusker" with massive ivory tusks. Wilson's final realization that his is a petty, ignoble pursuit comes at a late point and with a tragic price, as the local expert guide Kivu  is killed protecting him from an elephant Wilson decides not to shoot. The film is a thinly disguised account of writer Peter Viertel's experiences working with John Huston  while he made the film The African Queen, which was shot on location in Africa at a time when location shoots outside of the United States for American films were very rare.
