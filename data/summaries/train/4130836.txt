Johnny Stewart  is a lifelong con-man who meets a girl, Amber Evans , and tries to impress her by cleaning up his act and doing things the honest way. He becomes a mailroom clerk at the credit card firm where she works and soon finds that he needs money to impress Amber. So, he develops a scheme to commit identity theft  with the credit card information of deceased cardholders that he has access to due to his mailroom position. He justifies his actions because he knows that he is only stealing from the company and not harming the individual cardholders. With the help of his brother and fellow conman , he charges large amounts of money to the cards with the intention of impressing Amber. The supervisor, Keith Heading   records Johnny stealing a returned credit card, and cons him into joining his credit card ring.
