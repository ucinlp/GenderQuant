 Standing at a subway station a young man, Kurono , watches as his old primary school friend, Kato , attempts to rescue a man who has fallen onto the tracks. Kurono ends up on the tracks with Kato after the man has been rescued, just as a train is speeding through the station. The pair are surprised to find themselves not dead, but rather relocated to a room with a few other people. When they turn round they see a strange black sphere, about two metres in diameter. Before they can discover what has happened, the sphere begins to display messages on its surface including one which tells them who to kill. After the messages the sphere projects two large drawers filled with metal brief cases and strange handguns. They find that they are part of a strange game where they must not only work out how to play, but also how to survive.  Kurono decides to continue playing to achieve 100 points, and he and several remaining members of the team continue to work for GANTZ.
