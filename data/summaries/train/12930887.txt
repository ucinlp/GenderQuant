Act 1. Gilberte Valandray  is the socialite wife of rich Parisian businessman Georges Valandray  from whom she has concealed a previous but unvalidated marriage in America, being aware of her husband's belief in the indissolubility of a relationship based on a first sexual experience. Only her spinster sister Arlette  knows the secret. Secure in her husband's confidence in her, Gilberte now encourages a circle of amorous admirers, as flirts but nothing more, including Faradel , a middle-aged dilettante, and Charley , a young avant-garde artist who is also pursued by Gilberte's young friend Huguette . Gilberte is then aghast to discover that her husband has invited to dinner an American, Eric Thomson , with whom he is about to sign a deal, and who is none other than her first husband. With embarrassment Gilberte appeals to the truculent Eric to preserve her secret. Act 2. Ten days later, at a soirée at the Valandrays' house, preparations are in hand for a performance of Charley's new play "Âmes primitives", set in Mexico. Eric is considering whether to renew his marital claims upon Gilberte, who seeks to deter him by demonstrating that Charley is her lover. Faradel offers the use of his bachelor flat to Charley who invites Huguette there - and Gilberte. Meanwhile Eric, who is about to take over the lease of the same flat himself, gives the address to Georges. Act 3. The following afternoon, all the characters arrive under different pretexts at Faradel's bachelor flat, to the bemusement of the concierge Madame Foin . Just as Georges thinks he has discovered his wife's secret, Arlette declares that it was she who was Eric's first wife and now they are reconciled - and Eric upholds the lie, delightedly overcoming his longstanding horror of being kissed on the lips. Meanwhile Charley has been happily seduced by Huguette, and Georges and Gilberte are restored to peace of mind.
