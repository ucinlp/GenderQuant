Leon Phelps  was a Saturday Night Live character played by Tim Meadows during the 1990s. The sketch was that of a broadcast program in which Phelps, a young, suave black man, would give dubious romantic advice and lovemaking tips.{{cite web}} The Ladies Man openly proclaimed that he would court any woman at all, including skanks, providing the woman weighs no more than 250 pounds. A night of romance would generally center around a bottle of Courvoisier. After finally going too far during a broadcast, Leon is fired, but he receives a note from one of his former flames who wants him to come back to her -- and is willing to support him in high style. This sounds just fine with Leon, except that the woman didn't sign her name, and now Leon has to backtrack through his numerous conquests of the past and figure out who wants him to work his love magic. Meanwhile, a secret group called the Victims of the Smiling Ass , consisting of the angry husbands and boyfriends who've been cuckolded by Leon, have discovered Leon as their target and are now hot on his trail, eager to get revenge. Will Leon discover who his true love is and live happily ever after with her, or will he end up as a victim of the V.S.A.'s revenge?
