Professor Beest Lee  narrates over clips of animals and their quirky behavior. Scenes include: * Kissing porcupines * A rabbit sent into space and returning with an alien wife and kids. * An orangutan that saws a hole in the ceiling of his cage to pull down a fridge full of food * A beaver literally "damming"  a river * A man who proclaims to an entertainment agent his dog can talk whereas all the dog's answers are "ruff", particularly for the answers to the top of a house , the owner's name  and the greatest baseball player . When the agent throws them out, the dog picks himself up, dusts himself off, and declares to his owner: "Maybe I should've said DiMaggio?" * A groundhog who uses advanced technology to predict the weather * A mouse that scares an elephant but is then scared by a tiny elephant  * A hen that lays cube-shaped eggs, to the chagrin of another hen  * A dog patiently waiting on the front porch for his master that hasn't been home in three years, then browbeats him when he finally returns at the cartoon's end . * The classic "trained pigeons" gag  in which the trainer's pigeons, when released from their cage, fly past the table of miniature obstacles and out the window. * A hospital room with a dog who, underneath his bandaged leg, has a cat latched on and won't let go * A chameleon that can blend into different unicolor screens but cannot bring himself to attempt a multi-color plaid screen:
