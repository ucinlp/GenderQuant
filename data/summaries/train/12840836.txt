The center of the drama is the young unmarried but pregnant Carmen Castro  who during the first few minutes of the film informs her cousin Stella . Stella scoffs and recommends abortion. The father of the child, Jerry, also recommends abortion. Her over religious landlady Juling , who is busy juggling her religious aims and her legal quarrel with the poor families illegally living in her land, however strongly suggests that she keeps the baby as killing it would be a sin against God. Carmen sees signs that would seemingly suggest an answer to her difficult decision. Her poor neighbors struggle for money to feed their children. She sees a physically malformed child vending goods outside the church. She loses her job at a financing company due to the struggling economy during that time. Carmen eventually decides to have an abortion in a deeply moving scene with close up shots of the cold steel utensils used by the doctor to undertake it. The cold steel of the abortion tools and the close up shots in turn attempt to emphasise the coldness of killing an unborn child.
