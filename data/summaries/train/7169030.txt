Kitty, Jean and Ted are all children of divorce. The two girls are left in a convent school by their mothers and Ted's upbringing is sketchy at best. When the three of them grow up, Ted falls in love with Jean. Kitty loves Vico, an impoverished prince, but she refuses to marry him because her mother, Katherine, has drilled into her the necessity of marrying for money. So Kitty sets her sights on the wealthy Ted, even though Jean is her friend. After a night of drunken revelry, Ted wakes up to find he and Kitty are married. Even though he is desperately unhappy, Jean doesn't want their parents' mistake repeated and refuses to allow him to seek a divorce so that he can marry her. A few years later, things have gotten much worse for Kitty and Ted. Although they have a baby, it does nothing for the marriage and Ted does everything he can to avoid his unwanted wife. Then Kitty finds out that, for religious reasons, Vico can never marry a divorced woman. Since she can see no other way out, she poisons herself so that Ted and Jean can be together.
