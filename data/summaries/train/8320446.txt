Bobbie Langham  and Bailey Lewis  are life partners who own and run a pub together in Dublin, Ireland, aided by Bailey's brother, David Lewis . Bobbie discovers that she has breast cancer, and is determined to deal with the crisis on her own. Meanwhile, the parents of Bobbie's 10-year old nephew Alan Langham  have been killed, and Bailey talks a reluctant Bobbie into taking him in. Bobbie and Bailey are oppositesâ€”Bobbie the cool, quiet, reserved, practical one; Bailey warm, outgoing and eccentric . As Bobbie undergoes treatment for her illness she finally agrees to accept Bailey's help. In turn, Bailey takes over the management of the pub and takes care of Bobbie, growing more responsible. In the end, Bobbie learns to express her love for Alan and accepts him into the extended "family", much to Bailey's delight. A "wedding-commitment" ceremony between Bobbie and Bailey, attended by family and friends, solidifies the women's commitment to each other.
