Dana Marschz  is a recovering alcoholic and failed actor who has become a high school drama teacher in Tucson, Arizona, "where dreams go to die". Despite considering himself an inspirational figure, he only has two enthusiastic students, Rand  and Epiphany , and a history of producing poorly-received school plays that are essentially stage adaptations of popular Hollywood films (his latest being [[Erin Brockovich . When the new term begins, a new intake of students are forced to transfer into his class as it is the only remaining arts elective available due to budget cutbacks; they are mostly unenthusiastic and unconvinced by Dana’s pretentions, and Dana comes into conflict with Octavio , one of the new students. Dana is floored when Principal Rocker  notifies him that the drama program is to be shut down at the end of the term. Seeking to inspire his students, Dana undertakes to write and produce an original play: a sequel to Hamlet featuring time travel to avoid the deaths of the characters, and new, more controversial content, including the introduction of Jesus Christ  as one of the characters, complete with a song-and-dance number titled "Rock Me Sexy Jesus." The kids gradually warm to the project, but Rand &mdash; cast as a bi-curious Laertes and overshadowed by Octavio as Hamlet &mdash; storms out of the drama group and provides a copy of the play’s script to Principal Rocker, who orders Dana to stop the controversial production. Dana is further traumatized when his wife Brie  leaves him for the uninteresting, but fertile, boarder Gary  they had taken into their home to supplement their modest income, and reveals that he himself is infertile. Despondent, Dana falls off the wagon and tries to abandon the project, but his students encourage him to continue, arranging an abandoned warehouse and rave spot, technical assistance, and security being provided by the high school's football and wrestling teams. Dana also learns that the cancellation of the play has become a civil liberties issue encouraged by fanatical ACLU activist Cricket Feldstein . As a result, the play opens to a sold-out house, including a critic from The New York Times. Rand returns to the group, apologizing for his desertion; Dana allows him to return to the role of Laertes. The play itself initially meets with a mixed reception, due to its controversial content and mangling of the original play; in keeping with a running joke throughout the movie, much of the content revolves around the characters using time travel to mend their troubled relationships with their fathers; it ends with both Hamlet and Jesus forgiving their fathers for the wrongs done to them. Although initially reluctant to engage with the play, with several protesters infiltrating the audience to stage a direct protest, the play gradually wins the audience over. The film ends with Dana and his favorite actress, Elisabeth Shue &mdash; who he is now dating &mdash; meeting Dana’s students to prepare for the show's Broadway opening, complete with original cast.
