The U.S. Navy commissions a group known as "Blue Water" to genetically engineer a half-shark, half-octopus for combat. During a demonstration off Santa Monica, the Sharktopus escapes the control of its creators and causes mayhem. Hunted by Blue Water and a television crew, the monster attacks numerous beach-goers.
