In this crime caper set in the eccentric London art world, Nick Edwards  owes £50,000 to the super-smooth, yet brutal, crime lord Foster Wright  and has four days to find the cash. Nick knows nothing about working a heist of that size, but when he stumbles across a lost sketch by the legendary Italian artist Antonio Fraccini, he believes he’s in the clear. The problem is, it’s only worth 15 grand. With the help of the eternal cynic Eve  and her extremely talented yet naïve artist brother Tony , the plan is hatched; to forge the drawing and sell it to five Mayfair galleries within an hour before anyone cottons onto the fact there’s a scam going down.
