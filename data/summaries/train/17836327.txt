Jungle medics Dr. Sturdy  and his daughter Anne  are opposed by witch doctor Futa ([[James Edwards  of the Nagasu tribe, who regards their work as a threat to his own livelihood. Futa incites the tribe to waylay Anne's fiance Dr. Ken Warwick , who is saved by Tarzan . Later Tarzan and his adopted son Tartu  enlist the doctors' services on behalf of Jane , suffering from appendicitis. Futa hypnotizes Moto , a native assistant of Sturdy, to murder Jane, but Tarzan thwarts the plot. Learning that the young Nagasu chief  is sick, Tarzan attempts to persuade them to let Sturdy treat them. Seizing his chance, Futa has the ape man taken captive and condemned to death. To restore his own credentials, the witch doctor then undertakes to cure the chief himself, hedging his bets by having his henchman Ramo  steal medicine from Sturdy. Unfortunately, Ramo purloins a poison by mistake. Freeing himself, Tarzan intervenes and prevents the administration of the poison to the chief; Futa then swallows it himself to demonstrate that there is no harm in it â€” and dies. Dr. Sturdy is consequently called in, successfully curing the chief.
