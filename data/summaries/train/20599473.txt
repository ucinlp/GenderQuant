The Pink Panther buys a car from a car shop, he takes it to his garage, puts some Pink Lacquer, then takes it out for a ride, only to have it go crazy when it races Granny Flash, Senior Citizens Drag Champion. Pink and Granny Flash race beside a cliff, Granny Flash tries to push the car off the cliff twice, but Pink's car lands in Granny Flash's car, she pushes the Emergency Ejector button, causing the car to eject out of the car and fall down from the sky. Luckily, a parachute ejects from the back of the car, causing the car to parachute down to safety. It lands back at the car shop, the Pink Panther takes his money back and leaves.
