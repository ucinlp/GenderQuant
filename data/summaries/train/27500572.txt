After her wild parties, with jitterbugs and strip poker, Helen's Grandmother, Margaret Fealy, locks her out of the house; and, she runs away to marry a man she met through correspondence. Marian gets fed up with her daughter and her friends. She laments that she never got to be young, and free, like they are; and, tells her daughter to go live with her Father, for awhile. Mary doesn't get along with his new wife; so, she decides to go visit Helen, after getting a letter, from her. The "Count" is furious with Marian, for letting her daughter traipse across the country, without knowing who she is with; and, warns her that mail-order marriage scams can be one of the worst traps there is. Together they track down an address, and he hurries to try to save Mary and Helen, Betty Atkinson. The girls have been imprisoned in a prostitution and white slavery ring, in a big old mansion. It was all a rouse; and, Helen was beaten until she gave in, and wrote to send for her friend.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/82288/Mad-Youth/full-synopsis.html Time is running out.
