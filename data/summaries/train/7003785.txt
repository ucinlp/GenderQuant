Queens car salesman Joey O'Brien  must deal with the ever-increasing pressures in his life: he has an ex-wife demanding alimony, a daughter who's missing, a married mistress  and a single mistress  who are both desperately in love with him, and a two-day deadline to either sell twelve cars or lose his job. In addition, he has an outstanding loan to a Mafia don which he must either quickly repay, or lose his life. On the day of the big dealership car sale , the car dealership is taken hostage by an AK-47-toting motorcyclist   who believes his wife  is cheating on him. Joey manages to talk the man out of doing any harm to the other hostages, as police surround the dealership. After most of the hostages are released, the police wound the assailant, not realizing his gun is not loaded. Joey promises to stick with him while he recovers. The crisis solves all of Jimmy's problems: his mistresses learn of each other and dump him, his daughter returns, his job is secure, the Mafia don  forgives his debt, and he begins to reconcile with his ex-wife.
