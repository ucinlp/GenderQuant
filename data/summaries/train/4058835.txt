Belu  and Bhola  are left to the care of their wicked aunt Kamla  when their mother dies. She forces them to beg in the streets and grabs all the money they get. A bootlegger John Chacha  teaches them to lead a life of self-respect and work for a living instead of begging. They scrimp and save to buy a shoe-polish kit and start shining shoes. Kamla finds out about what they have been doing behind her back, beats them and throws them out of the house. Meanwhile John Chacha is arrested and the kids are left to fend for themselves. When it rains and people don't get their shoes polished any more, the children are in danger of starving. But Bhola believes that he will never beg anymore but on one rainy night, a man tosses him a coin and he rejects it, but Belu takes it as she is very hungry. Bhola slaps Belu for that and she drops the coin. Lastly, the police comes and is taking children with them. Belu rushes in an unknown train, but Bhola is arrested. In the train, Belu is adopted by a rich family and she mopes for her brother. Bhola after getting out tries to search for Belu but to no avail. Through a turn of events, he ends up in an orphanage which he doesn't like and runs away. Unable to find any work and extremely hungry, Bhola starts begging again. Bhola incidentally runs into Bhelu when he is begging at railway station where Bhelu along with her new family has come to onboard train for a vacation. Humiliated, Bhola runs away while his sister runs for him. John Chacha has also come to the station to say final good bye and he sees Bhelu following Bhola and he also runs after Bhola. But he falls while chasing Bhola and starts bleeding. Bhola stops running and Bhelu and Bhola are again united. And then the rich family adopt both of the siblings and live happily ever after.
