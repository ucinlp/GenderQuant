A geographic society proposes to travel around the world. Many vehicles are made for this voyage, including a submarine, an automobile, and a railway box car filled with ice. The machines are loaded onto a train, and are sent to the Swiss Alps, where the travelers will begin their journey. They first board an automobile named "The Impossible Carriage" and journey through the mountains, only to crash and to be rushed to a hospital. After they have recovered, they board a train with their vehicles, and journey up a mountain top. Getting higher and higher every minute, with balloons attached to the train, they rise into space and are "swallowed" by the sun. The travelers land with a crash. They are happy to be alive, but the heat is too much. All but one of the travelers are loaded into an ice box, but are suddenly frozen. The remaining traveler starts a fire to melt the ice, and moves the individuals over to a submarine. The submarine is launched off the sun, and falls into an ocean. A boiler problem causes the submarine to explode, and the travelers are thrown up into the air, and fall onto land. A grand rejoicing is held for the individuals.
