Presented in flashback, the film tells the story of an anthropology class's all-too-successful expedition into the American wilderness to find the truth behind the Sasquatch legend. Along the way, the team learns about the creature's previous victims, uncover the squalid story of a hermit  who gave birth to a mutation after being raped by the monster, and finally come face to face with the beast himself. The film is famed for the scene where a motorcyclist has his penis ripped off while urinating in a bush.<ref nameBigfoot: the life and times of a legend|yearUniversity of Chicago Press|isbn279|urlRI4SlHwH7h0C&pgNight+of+the+demon+man+penis+ripped&hlif8STv2OM4KY8QOl07S6Dg&sabook_result&ct1&vedonepage&qfalse|author5 July 2011|page7}}
