Set in the coastal town of Brighton, England, Dirty Weekend follows the story of Bella, a mild-mannered secretary who works from home in a basement flat. Soon, she finds herself the victim of Tim , a voyeur who watches her through her windows and plagues her with obscene phone calls in which he threatens to assault and rape her. After the police refuse to offer any assistance, Bella visits Nimrod , an Iranian clairvoyant who tells her that she does not necessarily need to be a victim, and suggests that she take matters into her own hands. That night, Bella breaks into Timâ€™s flat while he is sleeping and batters him to death with a claw hammer. Empowered, Bella embarks on a dirty weekend in which she slaughters six more men by a variety of methods. Ultimately, she evades capture by the authorities and prepares to carry on her crusade in the large, faceless city of London.
