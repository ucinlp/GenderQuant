Sombabu Ali, the only son of well-to-do farmers, is a pampered guy and a wastrel. His laziness is the talk of the town; though, as is usual with this kind of movies, the village folk are equally eloquent about his good nature. Being a lout, Sombabu wastes his days roaming around the village with his four stooges, swindling foreigners in the guise of a tourist guide, and consuming liquor in buckets. On one such day, he chances upon Rohini , who has come to the village to do a project on the temple. He promptly falls in love with her, but dallies about proposing. Meanwhile, a team of three villains  covet the land belonging to Sombabu's parents. They hatch a plan to get Sombabu out of the way, the upshot of it being that our hero is imprisoned for stealing idols. The movie continues its meandering and mind-numbing path, and ends on an expected note.
