An oil pipeline layer named Chester  returns to his suburban Los Angeles home from the North Pole, bringing with him a small sample of a mysterious frozen substance uncovered by a bulldozer on a job site. Prior to taking the blob to a lab to be analyzed, he places the storage container with the substance in his freezer, but he and his wife accidentally let it thaw, releasing "the Blob". It starts by eating a fly, then a kitten, Chester's wife, and then Chester himself . Lisa , a friend, walks in to see Chester being devoured by the Blob. She escapes, but cannot get anyone to believe her, not even her boyfriend Bobby . Meanwhile the rapidly-growing creature quietly preys upon the town. Some of its victims include a police officer and two hippies  in a storm drain, a barber  and his client, transients , a Scout Master , a farm-full of chickens, and a bar full of people . At one point Lisa and Bobby find themselves trapped in Bobby's truck with the creature attempting to find a way inside. In the panic the truck's air conditioning is accidentally switched on and the Blob retreats, establishing its vulnerability to cold as in the original film . The now-massive blob then invades a bowling alley and a skating rink . It is finally stopped when Bobby activates the rink's ice mechanism, freezing it. While the frozen blob is being filmed by a television crew, one of the crew's bright lights is positioned on the ground, melting a small portion of it, which oozes toward the sheriff and envelopes his feet as he is speaking on camera. The movie ends with a cliffhanger, not knowing if the Blob is stopped, as it is about to engulf the local sheriff.
