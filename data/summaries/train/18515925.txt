Broadway star Al Howard’s  business is slow, and no producers are taking part in his business. It seems that he just trots off to Mexico any time he wants, causing shows to close and producers to lose money. When Howard’s sister, Molly , can no longer find Al work, she teams him up with a young, talented dancer named Dorothy  for a club date in Chicago. Now, with another success, Al wants to open his own club on Broadway, so he borrows money from a gangster  to open the show. Al has Dorothy, who he ignores, the gangster’s money and the gangster's female, Luana . All he has to do is keep them all happy, until Luana sets her cap for the beleaguered Al, and everything terrible that could happen does.
