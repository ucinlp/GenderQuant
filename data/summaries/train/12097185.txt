Unlike many of his Phoenix police detective partners, Harry Collins is a good cop and, despite his very idiosyncratic value system, a decent man. However his compulsive gambling has got him heavily in debt to a gangster bookie. Refusing to Welsh on a bet, and with only 48 hours to pay his debt, Harry is offered a deal: murder Joey, a young prisoner who may provide the police with information about the bookie, and the debt will be written off. Harry can not contemplate such action and prefers to offer Joey some potentially life-saving advice: “You never rat out anyone… It doesn't pay in the long run”. When Harry's corrupt partner Mike finds out his predicament he volunteers to kill the bookie but Harry dismisses the offer saying he will “never betray a friend”. Instead, Harry comes up with a plan to rob Louie the loan shark, who stashes a large amount of money in the safe in his strip club. To pull this off Harry needs the help of Mike and two other corrupt and brutal cops, James and Fred, busily engaged in moonlighting for Louie. A budding relationship with Leila, his understanding barmaid, promises Harry a new beginning a long way from Phoenix after he completes the hold up. All does not go according to plan. Webber turns out to be dirty too killing Fred and fatally wounding Harry while Mike and James are ambushed by the cops, James realizes that there is no way out and decides to turn himself in, Mike kills James and gets blown away by the cops. Harry manages to escape and sabotages Webber at this home. He takes the money Webber took and returns to Chicago to pay off his debt. Harry explains Chicago that he told Joey to shut his mouth but Chicago admits that he ordered someone in prison to slit Joey's throat and tells Harry to do things his way the next time. Harry then draws his gun and kills Chicago and his men. After the shooting Harry leaves the restaurant and drives off the road where he passes away.
