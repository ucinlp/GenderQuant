After years of saving a small town, its population is angered that The Lone Ranger never stays long enough to receive gratitude for his deeds. He stays, and finds that he likes hearing the phrase "Thank you, Mask Man". When asked what the community could give him in return for his services, The Lone Ranger points to an Indian, Tonto, and says that he wants him. Asked why The Lone Ranger wants Tonto, he replies that he wants to have sex with him, explaining that he is not a homosexual, but that he had "heard a lot about it and read exposÃ©s" and would like to "try now to see how bad it is. Just once." The Lone Ranger also requests a horse, suggesting that he wants to perform bestiality.{{cite book |last1Frank |title1974 |publisher0-913460-31-1 |page"Cohen-78">{{cite book}}
