The film focuses on a novelty inventor named "Johnson", a 20-something from Texas who has designed what he believes will be the next great novelty item. He makes contact with a Chinese manufacturer in Shanghai via Craigslist and decides to fly to China with his life savings to create his dream product. Upon arrival, his contact fails to show up or answer his phone. Johnson decides to negotiate the manufacturing contract himself, without knowledge of Chinese. Johnson explains, "every object has a story, and in that story is an inventor." Throughout Johnson's adventure, the history of iconic novelty inventors is revealed, including joy buzzer's Soren Sorensen Adams, pet rock's Gary Dahl, slinky's Richard T. James, and the ant farms' Milton Levine.
