The Banqiao dam  in China which has somewhat the same capacity of Mullaperiyar dam , was destroyed by torrential rains in 1975 which claimed the lives of 250,000 people. The documentary is based on the possibility of a similar disaster that can happen in a place like Kerala and its dire consequences in the aftermath. It is estimated that 85% of all the large dams, numbering about 40,000 all over the world would have passed their projected life spans by 2020. As the total numbers of dams are increasing, the numbers of hazardous dams are also increasing at an alarming rate. Torrential rains, floods, earthquakes and landslides are the ones that can break the dam, and global warming has of late increased the incidence of untimely rains and floods. Despite been warned about the disaster caused by these dams, they are neither checked nor reconstructed. The documentary is a mirror that reflects the unspoken miseries of thousands of people who are under the terror of a possible dam collapse.<ref name Documentary film based on Mullaperiyar Dam released in Kochi | publisher  2011-1-04 | url = http://news.oneindia.in/2011/01/04/documentaryfilm-based-on-mullaperiyar-dam-released-inkochi.html }}
