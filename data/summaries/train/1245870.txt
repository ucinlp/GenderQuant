Pat Riley  is an obnoxious job-hopper of indeterminable sex who is searching for a steady foundation in his/her life. Pat encounters Chris , a person of similarly indeterminable sex, and the two fall in love and get engaged. Meanwhile, Pat's neighbor, Kyle Jacobsen , develops an unhealthy obsession with unveiling Pat's sex and begins stalking him/her. Kyle sends in a tape of Pat performing karaoke to a TV show called America's Creepiest People, bringing him/her to the attention of the band Ween, who features him/her in one of their performances playing the tuba. Pat becomes distraught when he/she learns that Ween intended to only use him/her for one gig, then breaks up with Chris, and discovers that his/her laptop diary has been stolen. Later, it turns out that Kyle stole Pat's diary, and he tries coercing Pat into revealing the computer's password so he can access the files. Pat's only answer is that the word is in the dictionary. Kyle then begins typing in every single word in the dictionary. Meanwhile, Pat is harassed by a gang of thugs intent on discovering his/her sex, and Pat becomes distraught over his/her androgynous nature. He/she goes to complain to his/her friend, Kathy , host of a radio talk show and therapist, but the station fires Kathy and hires Pat due to his/her acerbic reactions to call-in listeners. Kyle ends up going through the entire dictionary until he reaches the last word, "zythum" , which is the password. After reading through the diary, he discovers no new information in regards to Pat's gender, and finally snaps. Kyle calls Pat on his/her radio show, and tells him/her to meet him at the Ripley's Believe It or Not! Museum if Pat ever wants to see his/her laptop again. Pat arrives to find Kyle dressed exactly like him/her. Kyle demands that Pat remove his/her clothes, and Pat runs off into a Ween concert. After Kyle corners him/her on a catwalk, Pat falls and his/her clothes get caught on a hook, tearing off his/her pants and lowering him/her in front of the cheering audience . Kyle is subsequently taken away by security guards. Pat then runs to see Chris just as he/she is leaving on an ocean liner, and the two get married in an epilogue.
