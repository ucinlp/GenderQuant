Disturbed by this budding romance, Nico does everything possible to sabotage Adam’s efforts to woo Nani. A love triangle develops when Nico’s favorite pet shop supervisor, Fadzly tries to get close to Nani. However unbeknownst to all, his intentions are far from honourable as his actions are motivated by his goal to capture and sell Nico to an exotic food restaurant. This hilarious flick features cutting edge character animation with the lively Nico, coupled with a strong dose of witty comedy and dialogue, creating a fun, cheeky romantic comedy that will appeal to the young and young-at-heart.http://www.gua.com.my/hiburan/ulasan/Aura_Cinta_Kura_Kura_Menyerlah.html http://www.tupai.com.my/2012/02/malam-gala-filem-cinta-kura-kura.htmlhttp://www.gua.com.my/index.php/hiburan/berita-hangat/Eksperimentasi_Seni_Nizam_Zakaria.htmlhttp://www.hmetro.com.my/articles/Metaforakura-kura/Articlehttp://www.era.fm/Sensasi/Gosip-Mosssip/February-2012/Filem-Hit--Cinta-Kura-Kura
