Police Inspector Tejpal Randhawa  is assigned to investigate the case of the dead woman whose body is recovered from a small pond. Insp. Tejpal checks if this matter can be linked with a missing persons' report filed by Ravi Patwardhan  and his father-in-law. The dead woman is identified as Sheela , Ravi's wife. According to Ravi, Sheela had left their home to go to visit her parents. When she had not arrived at their house 24 hours later, he himself had gone to their house, and on not being able to locate her, had accompanied his father-in-law to the nearest police station and filed a report as she is missing. Insp. Tejpal concludes that Sheela was waylaid on her way to her parents' house by person unknown, beaten, and her body was left in the pond. But this case puzzles him, as there was no apparent motive for unknown person to waylay her, as no money was taken, and her body does not show any signs of sexual molestation. Taking these facts into consideration, Insp. Tejpal starts to suspect Ravi. Ravi's assistant  tries to help Ravi. However, her involvement makes the matter worse. The movie then takes the audience through thrilling tale of how Ravi makes out of this matter and truth behind Sheela's murder.
