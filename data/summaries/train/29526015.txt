In French Tunisia, during the Second World War, a convoy of the French Foreign Legion is charged to recover gold bars of six billion francs from a bank in El Ksour in order to bring them into a safe place for the French government. The 4 April 1943, the contingent of the Foreign Legion enters the town of El Ksour which is partially destroyed. A German platoon, who holds the town, ambush the FFL convoy and kill most of them. Only 5 légionnaires survive the attack and take refuge in a hotel in ruins. At night, Légionnaire Borzik is killed while trying to bring weapons and ammunitions back to the rest of the team. The 4 remaining légionnaires find the corpulent and pusillanimous artilleryman Beral  sitting in the toilets, suffering from dysentery. However, with his brave assistance, Sergent Augagneur  used an abandoned French cannon to kill or drive out the Germans. Gold feverish Sergent Augagneur wants to share the gold between the four légionnaires and start to fight with Adjudant Mahuzard  who wants to accomplish the mission. Trying to steal the gold bars by heading South with a tank, Sergent Augagneur runs in an entire French army, marching North, and successfully pretends he was looking for them to give the gold bars back. Sergent Augagneur is finally awarded with the Légion d'Honneur for this action.
