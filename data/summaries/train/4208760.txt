The story follows a leading scientist in the field of police robotics, Dr. J. Barrett C. Coldyron , whose corrupt boss, Division Commander Earl Buglar , orders an experimental police-robot prototype - dubbed R.O.T.O.R.  - to be completed within sixty days at the behest of the shady senator Donald D. Douglas, who intends to take public credit for the project and use it to catapult himself into the White House. Coldyron warns Buglar that the prototype is several years away from completion but is forced to resign and is replaced by his incompetent assistants, Dr. Houghtaling  and his robot Willard. In Coldyron's absence, R.O.T.O.R. is inadvertently activated and put on duty, where it proceeds to execute a motorist  for speeding and terrorize his young fianc√©, Sonya , who the robot implicated as an accomplice in her boyfriend's violation. Upon learning his creation has escaped, Cpt. Coldyron enlists the help of his beautiful colleague from Houston, Dr. Corrine Steele  who designed the unit's combat chassis. Together, Steele and Coldyron track down the rampaging robot and attempt to stop it from killing again before it is too late.
