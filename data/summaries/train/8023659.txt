Spencer and Katherine Davenport must fly to Pennsylvania to spend the holidays with their father. But, when a massive blizzard grounds all planes and cancels all the flights, the children are sent to the U.M.  room, where they meet motor-mouthed Charlie, sensitive Donna, snotty Grace, and mysterious Beef. The children later sneak out and cause trouble around the airport. When they return to the U.M. room, head of passenger relations, Oliver Porter sends all remaining children to a lodge down the road. But, the children cannot remain caged and sneak out once more. Knowing his younger sister might be disappointed, Spencer sends Beef to get a Christmas tree. Later, on their way to the lodge, Porter and his men pursue the children, but fail. After visiting Katherine, the unaccompanied minors are brought back to the airport. Porter puts them in solitary confinement and turns on security cameras in the room. The children escape through air ducts and decorate the airport in Christmas decorations. On Christmas morning, Santa  gives the stranded passengers gifts. The film ends as the blizzard later stops and the Davenports have a reunion when their father arrives in a Humvee.
