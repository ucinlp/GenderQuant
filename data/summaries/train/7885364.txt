The Touch tells the story of a Chinese family of martial artists and acrobats who have been performing for many generations. The family are, in secret, guardians of a holy treasure accessible only by a spectacular jump which, to everyone else, is impossible to perform. One of the family members  and his girlfriend are kidnapped by a ruthless treasure hunter  to procure the priceless relic for him. Yeoh's character Pak Yin, with the help of Eric , her master thief ex-boyfriend, pursues them into an ancient desert where legends say the treasure is buried in order to uncover and protect the treasure that her ancestors had sworn to keep safe. The action culminates in a climactic sequence set in the booby-trapped subterranean Buddhist temple.
