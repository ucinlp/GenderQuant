Freelance assassin Hawkins  has plans to blow up Sir Gregory Upshott, a Cabinet minister  when the latter is discovered to be having an affair, about to be consummated at the Green Man Hotel. However his plans are accidentally uncovered and foiled by vacuum cleaner salesman Blake  who forges an unlikely alliance with Ann , engaged to be married to a rather stuffy BBC announcer, Willoughby-Cruft . The latter relationship breaks down when Willoughby-Cruft finds his fianc√©e under their bed with Blake and later, in her lingerie, accidentally entangled on the floor with him. As such, there are some romantic  interludes and Hawkins briefly has the task of trying to deal with his secretary, a friendly policeman, and prepare his bomb at the same time.
