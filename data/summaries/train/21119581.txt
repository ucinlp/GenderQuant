Inuk covers a journey from Greenland's south to its north as an homage to the origins of the Inuit people. It is the coming-of-age story of 16-year-old Inuk , who was raised in the south in Greenland's capital Nuuk, and who is torn between the violence of his alcoholic parents and his dreams of creating an Inuit rock band. He is sent to a foster home in the north, where his foster guardian and teacher, Aviaaja  sends him to the bear hunter Ikuma  so that he may learn wisdom. But Ikuma had begun to doubt himself after his own world began to decline due to the effects of global warming. This begins Inuk's difficult initiation into manhood through a journey by dogsled where the seal hunt replaces videogames. On his journey he meets and is attracted to the rebellious Naja . He finally reconciles his life, but in doing so re-awakens the old injury which had affected the life of Ikuma.
