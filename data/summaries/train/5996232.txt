Vijaykamal  is a son of a rich Thakur Suraj Singh but has lost his mind. He sees his lover Sapna marry his neighbour Bihari  and then commit suicide on the night of the Diwali party hosted by Bihari. This incident puts Vijay in shock. Thakur believes that if he be married, he would turn well. He hence approaches a tawaif Chand (played by [[Mumtaz  to pretend to be Vijay's wife and then help him be normal. But Chand is given cold treatment by Vijay's mother and his elder brother Kishore. Vijay treats Chand badly by also once sexually assaulting her. But later Chand becomes very friendly with Vijay and that starts improving his condition. Bihari who wishes to have Chand for himself also tries to persuade Vijay's young sister Radha. He promises Radha to make her actress in Bollywood and asks her to run away with money and gold. But Chand does not let Bihari's plan work. Vijay's younger brother Mohan  also falls in love with noble Chand but then suddenly leaves the home when he find that she is pregnant and is carrying Vijay's child. In a fight between Vijay and Bihari, Bihari falls off the terrace and this shocks Vijay making him normal again. But then Vijay is unable to recall Chand. She is then humiliated by the family and is thrown out of house. Then Mohan comes and accuses everyone for treating her like a toy and only using her when needed. He rescues her and tells the truth of how she did not let Bihari's plan work and save Radha. It is also revealed that Chand was actually born in a noble family and was only raised as a tawaif as she was found alone after a train accident. The family thus accepts Chand and all sets well.
