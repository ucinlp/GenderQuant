The film title references to the astrological phenomenon Saturn Return that occurs at the ages of 27-30, 58-60, and finally from 86-88, coinciding with the time it takes the planet Saturn to make one orbit around the sun. Lucy, a privileged North American expat in contemporary Berlin, living a life of post punk hedonism, roams the streets with her best friend, Derek. Together they use the city like a playground, a stage, and a never ending party. Into their lives enters Galia, a young Israeli woman who is presumably carrying the promise of a better, cleaner way of living. A tribute to punk underground films turns into a melodrama, mirroring Lucy and Galia’s modulating states of mind. Their look into each other’s life and culture becomes an investigation of empty facades.
