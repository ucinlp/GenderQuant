Based on the vision of Hesiod, in the classic Teogon√≠a, the film begins in the city of Citrea when Cronos, the younger son of Uranus, cuts off the genitals of his father and it throws them into the sea. All the Gods will hope that, of the union of the genitals of Uranus and the foam of waters, Aphrodite is born. On the following day the Zephyrs find a young adolescent naked and sleeping in the borders of the sea. With no doubt, they determine that it is Aphrodite. They take the boy to Citrea where his status is judged. There he becomes a conflicting personage of ambiguous sexuality.
