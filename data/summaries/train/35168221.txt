The film begins at the ominous "Home of the Bleeding Heart" Catholic orphanage, where teenage delinquent "Piper" ([[Georg Olden  arrives by police escort. There he meets the cruel overseers; the stern head-mistress of the orphanage, Sister Serena , and the cattle-prod wielding head-master, Mr. Kurtz . After disobeying the home's loathsome authority figures, Piper is sent into solitary confinement where he befriends a group of adolescent trouble-makers; "Girl Joey" , the tough-talking "tomboy" of the group; "Mouse" , the smallest, youngest and "cutest" of the group; "Whitey" , the platinum blonde, self-appointed "leader" of the group; and "Blackie" , the "intellectual" and only black orphan at the home. As prospective "parents" come to the Home of the Bleeding Heart to assess the children for adoption, the orphans, desperate not to be separated from the "family" they have in each other, make every attempt not to be selected. However, the family of young misfits is shattered when the Fitzpatricks , a self-absorbed upper-class couple, find Mouse irresistible and decide to adopt him, promptly whisking him away to their suburban home in Santa Barbara. Devastated by Mouse's departure, the group of young rebels devise a plan to "rescue" him, outwitting the maniacal staff and escaping the oppressive orphanage. In their odyssey to free Mouse, the four street-smart teenagers lie, cheat and steal their way to Santa Barbara, wreaking havoc on suburbia every step of the way.
