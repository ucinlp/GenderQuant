The cartoon finds a row of signs saying it's rabbit season . Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck again are arguing over which of them is “in season” , while a befuddled Elmer Fudd tries to figure out which animal is telling the truth. Between using sneaky plays-on-words, and dressing himself in women's clothing , Bugs manages to escape unscathed, while Daffy repeatedly has his beak blown off, upside-down, and sideways by Elmer.
