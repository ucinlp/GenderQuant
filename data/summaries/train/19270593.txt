Based on Alan Marshall's three-part autobiography I Can Jump Puddles , This is the Grass  and In Mine Own Heart , the film tells of Marshall's childhood growing up in rural Victoria during the turn of the century. Contracting polio soon after attending school, the story retells the obstacles he faced as a child in trying to overcome his disability. As an adult, he later encounters prejudice from his debilitating disease while looking for work in Melbourne.
