After serving in the Army, the stooges decide to head off to college and major in criminology. Graduating with the lowest possible honors, the boys join the police force and they receive an assignment, which is to search for a bandit called the Eel who is going to rob the Biltless Hotel. They go to the hotel, but fail to catch the criminal or retrieve the money he stole. As a result, they are booted off the force and the three end up as ditch diggers.
