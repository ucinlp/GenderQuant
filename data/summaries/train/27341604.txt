The Young Girl and the Monsoon centers around a fraught relationship between father and daughter. Hank a 39-year-old photo-journalist  has agreed to look after his 13-year-old daughter Constance  for several weeks, while his ex-wife goes on a holiday with her new husband. Hank has compartmentalized his life in such a way that his daughter doesn't know anything about his 26-year-old girlfriend, Erin . Suddenly Erin wants to marry Hank and have his children, but he can't cope and drops her. Just as Hank has a chance of winning a prestigious journalistic award, he finds his private life a little too much to handle. His daughter cannot understand how he can take war photographs and not do anything about what he photographs. She is going through the emotional swings of a growing adolescent and the scenes between father and daughter, Kinney and Muth, are seen as the most impressive aspect of the film.New York Times review and FilmCritic.com review.
