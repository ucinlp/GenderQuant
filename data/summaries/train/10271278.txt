Tom and Jerry are engaged in some Western-flavored cat-and-mouse games  when Tom spots a pretty cowgirl cat. Overcome with lust, Tom dresses up in his best cowboy duds and tries to impress the cowgirl, but Jerry sabotages his efforts. Tom takes out tobacco and rolls it up on a piece of paper, then uses Jerry's tongue to stick it closed, Tom smokes it and breathes out the smoke to spell "Howdy" as The cowgirl is flustered and giggly. At one point he sings a song for her on a guitar but has a record player secretly playing the song for him, Jerry then takes the chance to mess with the speed of the recorder to make Tom sing fast and slow. Tom chases after Jerry for humiliating him and tries to lasso the mouse. Jerry manages to evade capture, and throws the lasso around the left horn of a nearby bull. When Tom is confronted by the angry bull, he tries to flee, but when he finds himself cornered, he resigns himself to his fate. With Tom out of commission, Jerry, now wearing his own cowboy duds, he waves his hat over to the cowgirl Toodles, then excitedly runs up to her face, grabs her by the cheeks and presses his lips onto the cowgirl's red lips, giving her a big kiss, and rides off into the sunset on Tom's back.
