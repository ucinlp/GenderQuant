The Hunger Games: Catching Fire begins as Katniss Everdeen  has returned home safe after winning the 74th Annual Hunger Games along with fellow tribute Peeta Mellark . Winning means that they must turn around and leave their family and close friends, embarking on a Victor's Tour of the districts. Along the way Katniss senses that a rebellion is simmering, but the Capitol is still very much in control as President Snow  prepares the 75th Annual Hunger Games  â€“ a competition that could change Panem forever.{{cite web}}
