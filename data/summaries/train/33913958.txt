Sang-hyun and Dong-hyun were born as conjoined twins with two heads sharing one body. Dong-hyun has the full control of their shared body, except his brother's head which is attached to the back of his. The two can never look at each other directly, as their heads always face the opposite direction. Dong-hyun looks "normal" as long as he wears his hoodie, which fully covers his brother's face. The two live nearly 30 years in a remote house with their father, who tells them not to go outside the property. However, things change when their father brings Seung-ah, a bubbly, good-hearted young artist, to the house to help Dong-hyun publish a children's book â€• which he always wanted to write. Throughout the film, peaches appear frequently.{{cite web}} Before the twins were born, their young parents enjoy a date near a peach tree. Near the same tree is where the young twins see their mother for the last time, who gradually loses her sanity and health after giving birth to them. The tree and its fruits witness the history of the twins, even before they are born; it sees the twins' beginning, their loss, and their isolated dreams and experiences.<ref nameLee|firstKoo Hye-sun presents conjoined twins tale on screen|url20121025000893|publisher25 October 2012}}
