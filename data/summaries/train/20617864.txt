Gangster Doo-shik has graduated school and is now attending college, though he is allowing his underling Sang-du to take classes on his behalf. For the final semester, all education majors are sent out to work in schools for teacher training. This is one job that Doo-shik must complete himself, and he is sent out to teach in the trouble-laden high school himself.
