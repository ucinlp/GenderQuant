It is the story of two naughty kids who are orphaned in an accident and are forced to live with their new guardian, the strict disciplinarian and army man - their grandfather. They have never seen him before due to differences between their parents and the grandpa. They get to have a first hand experience of the reason for these differences. While the plot is sad and very sympathy evoking, the movie itself is very light hearted to a large extent, and is a continuous laugh riot. The children's performances are especially noteworthy. How the grandpa and the children eventually warm up to each other, and the various troubles that the cook and other family members go through trying to raise the children make for a very interesting and fun viewing.
