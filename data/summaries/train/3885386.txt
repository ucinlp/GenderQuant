Stuart and George join the "Lake Scouts" which Stuart has trouble in. But Reeko makes a deal with The Beast, resulting in Snowbell getting captured by him and Stuart goes off on an adventure to save him. Eventually, Stuart and his friends trick the Beast into falling into a trap covered with sticks and leaves. The Beast is taken away to a Zoo and Reeko tells Stuart that he  was wrong to betray him.
