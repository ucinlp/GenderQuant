Captain Joe Ryan is salvaging for treasure off the seas of Pacific Ocean, when an undersea volcano erupts and causes a big wave. The ship was hit and Captain Ryan and his crews were forced to go into Nara Island for repairs. But when they arrive, many fishes and other marine animals' dead body was found, and they're like after being eaten by something. So, maybe the eruption had awakened something more awful. In the night, a roar was heard and all the villagers and the crews awake. They found a giant, blackish reptilian creature rising from the ocean, and devastates the village with fireballs. One of Ryan's companions, Sammy "Sam" Slade, try to attack the monster with a shotgun, but he gets eaten by the monster. The crews run to their ship, and successfully escapes. When they arrive to their homeland, Ireland, they show the photo Ryan taken of the creature to Professor Hendricks Albert, and he saids it was Gorgo, an ancient dinosaur species who is capable of breathing fireballs. This was the last of the kind, and they try to warn governor Sean, but in the dawn Gorgo surfaces from the coasts and wreaks havoc in Ireland. The giant monster almost devastates the whole city because tanks and gunfires are no avail, but returns to the sea. Now, Governor Sean believes everything and dispatches more military to subdue the monster. Harvey McCartin, a reporter interviews Captain Joe Ryan, and said the creature can destroy the world, because he had seen it himself. Finally, Gorgo surfaces in the night, and this is their final battle with the monster. A fierce battle ensues, but a final plan was devised. They set a bomb, and plants it into a military fighter jet. The pilot then shoots it to Gorgo, and the monster was flung. The dinosaur is thrown into the sea, but his head comes out from the water, and shoots a fireball that destroys the fighter jet. After that, Gorgo returns to the sea, retreating to take a rest, hibernating underwater, after the fierce battle......
