Jagannathan,  fondly known as Jaggubhai is an Indian Police Officer with sharp methods. His way of dealing the criminals strikes terror in the underground world. Tough is just an ordinary word to describe this upright, straight forward police officer. Jaggubhai is sent to Australia on an important mission to deal with anti social elements there. In Australia, Jaggubai meets Ilavarasi  and they both fall in love with each other. Jaggubai fails in his mission for which he came to Australia and the brief romance with Ilavarasi also ends abruptly. Jaggubai returns to India as a dejected officer, failing in his official duty and in personal life. But fate had something in store for him. Twenty years later, or as he says it twenty one years later, he gets a call from Australia stating that Ilavarasi is dead and has left him a will. He reaches Australia and is shocked to know that the brief encounter with Ilavarasi had resulted in a daughter Monisha , now a teenager. Jaggubai realises that has left behind his daughter and her wish that Jaggubhai should protect her. Monisha thinks that he is mother’s friend and tries to act cranky. Threat comes in the form of some anti social elements who want to eliminate Monisha. These thugs were the same ones who had tricked Jaggubai 21 years earlier and who, as Jaggubhai learns, had killed Ilavarasi. Now, it is Jaggubai’s duty to save his only daughter and settle old scores with the thugs. He now meets his former colleague Kaaliyappan or MIB . With his help, he kills the thugs and their leader. Monisha accepts Jaggubai as her father.
