The film details the life of Yiga Gyalnang , a Tibetan Opera singer after she is abducted and held as a prisoner at the Drapchi Prison in Lhasa, Tibet. The prison has been considered a symbol of control and fear and serves as the backdrop for the film. Although the film is set against the backdrop of the prison, the title of the film serves more as a metaphor for the illegal detention and unlawful persecution of Tibetans inside occupied Tibet. After being imprisoned, Yiga experiences both mental and physical abuse. With lack of food and water, she eventually escapes from the prison of roughly 2 years of captivity. She then makes her way west where she settles in India and eventually Europe, singing the songs that she was originally imprisoned for.<ref name | firstDrapchi: A Tibetan Opera Singerâ€™s Journey| publisher3 August 2012 | url 2 October 2012}}
