In the opening scene, Granny and Tweety are happily piloting a rented tugboat in a harbor, singing a kiddie-song duet about the carefree joys of their activity. It is the only scene in which Granny appears, as the rest of the cartoon is devoted to Sylvester's latest attempts to catch and eat Tweety, which begins when, after failing to grab a fish by hiding in a fisherman's basket,  he sees the boat carrying the canary chug past. Sylvester's attempts, all unsuccessful, include the following: * Using a rowboat to get to the tug. Tweety drops anchor in the boat's hull, sinking Sylvester . * Using an inflatable raft, which is deflated by a dart thrown be Tweety . * Two attempts at jumping off the bridge. The first jump is mistimed, as Sylvester lands in the smokestack, leaving him with his rear end on fire. A follow-up attempt from another bridge to parachute onto the boat's deck  results in a jammed pack, which only opens after Sylvester sinks to the bottom of the canal . * Using a snorkel to swim to the boat. A seagull finds Sylvester's pipe the perfect resting place ; gasping for air, the cat rushes back to shore, where he finds the seagull laid an egg in his mouth. The frightened gull flees as Sylvester angrily throws the egg at it; he misses and the egg hits him in the face. * Driving a motorboat, but Sylvester drives instead into the rapids and over a waterfall. All the time, the motor fails to start, and when it does, Sylvester pounds it to submission. * A lasso , which instead grabs the antenna of a speedboat. Sylvester decides to show off several waterskiing tricks ... until the inattentive puddy smashes into a pole. As he floats upside-down, a fish gurgles Tweety's signature line: "I tawt I taw a puddy tat."
