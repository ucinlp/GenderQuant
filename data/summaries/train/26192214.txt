The film centers on the eccentric Mooney family. Pa Mooney claims to be 199 years old, daughter Monica  is a sadist, son Malcolm is a halfwit and the whole family are werewolves! Youngest daughter Diana  returns home from medical school with a new husband, which Pa Mooney heartily disapproves of, but she is the last hope that they can overcome the ancient curse. Will she succeed?
