Sandy and Jonathan are roommates at Amherst College whose lives are explored and seem to offer a contrast to one another. Spanning a 25-year period, from their college years in the mid-1940s to middle aged adulthood in the early 1970s, the film explores their relationships with various women, Susan, Bobbie, Jennifer, Cindy, and Louise.
