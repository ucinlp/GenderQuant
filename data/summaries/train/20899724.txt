The film starts with Henry Griffin  learning from his oncologist that his cancer has spread and that he only has one year, two at most, left to live. This discovery starts him on a journey of self-reflection which includes starting a novel and taking a psychology class at New York University. In this class, he meets Sarah Phoenix . Although Phoenix sends Griffin the occasional mixed signals, the two team up for a whirlwind of adventurous and almost childlike activities: sneaking into movie theaters, drinking coffee until sunrise, hopping railroad cars, and more. The two fall for one another, and their relationship deepens when Phoenix reveals that she is also suffering from a terminal disease. Together, they strive to make the most of their last days alive.
