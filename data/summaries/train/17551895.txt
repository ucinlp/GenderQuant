In a dystopian near-future, the largest business in the history of mankind, Jeffers Corporation, controls the United States. The corporation and its leader, Mr. Jeffers, claim success is achieved thanks to a strict philosophy of mindless productivity. Jeffers teaches that productivity equals happiness, and the business logo  is the standard greeting in society. George Washington Winsterhammerman, a descendant of George Washington, is a Level-3 "TUNT" employee at the Jeffers Corporation, and is suffering from overeating and impotence as a result of his distant wife and eremitic son making him unhappy. George then begins to "suffer from dreams" wherein he is the first president of America, and he worries that he will suddenly explode like thousands of other people. Despite the government's attempts to combat explosions, people including George's co-worker, Todd, continue to die by exploding. After George's friend and superior, Charisma, is fired, George discovers she now works in a café, and meets with her in an attempt to avoid unhappiness. After briefly talking, Charisma confides that she has dreams too, and that they involve George and her running away together, only for her to abandon him apologetically. After his wife and son leave due to their own unhappiness, George then meets the real Mr. Jeffers, who wants to know why George drew a sunset to encapsulate his vision of the future. Mr. Jeffers reveals that the secret to inner-peace is to "kill the thing you love". This prompts George to return to Charisma, only to find she has been brainwashed to prevent thoughts that may lead to exploding. After taking her on a yacht with the intent of killing her, George makes a final attempt to rekindle the intimacy they shared at the café. She initially cannot remember him, but later she recalls him and begins to cry. They embrace. After spending the night with Charisma, George observes a boatful of men dressed as American Revolutionary soldiers, whom he then salutes.
