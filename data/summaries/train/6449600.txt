Kenny is a mockumentary that follows the fictional Kenny through his daily life. His work and his personal relationships are explored as Kenny goes about his day to day activities and speaks directly to the camera and his audience. Kenny provides a most basic service to the community: portable toilets. The audience sees Kenny interviewing potential clients and involved in major public events. It is important to Kenny to know the kind of food and drink to be served at these events as this will determine the level of service he provides. Never ashamed of his job, Kenny regards himself as a professional. Even at the most prestigious events for which he caters, Kenny realises that the most glamorous will need his portable toilets. He sees life in all of its complexities through the need of his services. When Kenny travels to Nashville to attend a toilet convention, he is thrilled to travel outside his native Melbourne. His ingenuousness and commitment to his profession opens business opportunities in Japan and the potential for a new relationship. Kenny declines the opportunity to become an executive and is ambivalent about the new relationship, until she shows herself to be sincerely interested in Kenny, for himself.
