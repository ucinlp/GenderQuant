Mississippi boy Ray Frye  accidentally killed a perverted woman from L.A. during making love. Now her vengeful husband, an addict cop no less , is waiting to strike when Frye gets out of prison. But Frye goes out of the Frye pen and into the fire when, on parole, he boards with the scheming little family of a chintzy car-wash entrepreneur. There's also a poison-dart serial killer on the loose who may or may not be relevant.
