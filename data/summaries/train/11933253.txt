Shot in the mockumentary style, Stalking Santa follows Lloyd Darrow  a self-proclaimed "Santologist," who has made it his life's mission - and obsession - to scientifically prove the existence of Santa Claus. It's an obsession that takes him from the hieroglyphics of Egypt to a Midwestern shopping mall at Christmastime, as his friends and family wonder whether he's lost his mind. Throughout this journey Darrow must also deal with his wife Barb , who supports him both emotionally and financially, the dysfunctional devotion from his intern Clarence , and a growing resentment from his 12-year-old son Keith . William Shatner is the film's unseen narrator and interviewer.
