During the leftist uprising in the 1960s in Venezuela, a young guerrilla-girl, living in secrecy, gives birth to her first daughter during Mother's Day. Due to that, her photos appear on the newspaper, since that moment they'd have to run away. Hidden places, false disguises and names are the daily life of THE GIRL, the narrator of the story. Alongside with her cousin , they re-live the adventures of their guerrilla parents, building up a labrynth with superheroes and strategies, in which nobody knows where the reality  begins. However, this children's game does not hide the deaths, tortures, denunciations and treasons within the guerrillas. The kids want to convert themseleves into The Invisible Man, in order to escape from the danger. However, they know that their parents might never comeback and therefore, they'll only receive Postcards from Leningrad.
