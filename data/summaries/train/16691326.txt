She finds accommodations with a restaurant maitre d', Fernando Girasole , and soon finds herself enjoying her new life. Meanwhile, her husband has sent a bumbling plumber, Costantino , as a private detective to find her. After meeting and falling in love with Grazia, Rosalba's neighbor across the hall, Costantino calls Rosalba's husband and quits, claiming that he is unable to find her. However, her husband's mistress appears and convinces Rosalba to return to her home in Pescara. Fernando follows her and persuades her to return to Venice with him.
