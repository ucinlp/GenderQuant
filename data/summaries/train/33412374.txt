After a successful business deal in Sacramento, Sam Butler returns to his Las Vegas home, and discovers his pregnant wife, Ruth, in bed with a sheriff's deputy. Whipped into a homicidal rage, Sam grabs the deputy's discarded gun and shoots him and Ruth to death. After cutting off Ruth's head  Sam leaves the house with it and picks up a prostitute named Tina. Taking Tina to the back of a motel, Sam ties her up and stabs her in the jaw, then rips one of her legs off with some rope attached to the back of his car. After murdering Tina, Sam enters a bar and shoots the bartender in the head, then follows a car advertising the Beautiful Lady Oil Wrestlers to an apartment, using a shovel to crush the head of a gardener who approaches him outside. Inside the apartment, the oil wrestlers are holding a baby shower for one of their members, Barbara, who is the first to be killed when Sam breaks in, having her unborn child cut out after Sam unsuccessfully attempts to rape her. Sam proceeds to murder the other five captive women  with various weapons, such as a knife, drill, hammer, gun and his bare hands, topping the massacre off by beheading a Jehovah's Witness who stops by after all the residents have been butchered. Eventually, a police officer arrives, and finds Sam in the gore drenched washroom, taking a bath in blood and dismembered limbs. When the officer orders him to put his hands up, Sam raises two severed arms, then shoots him. As the credits begin to roll, Sam glares at the camera, and the song "Las Vegas Blood Bath" starts to play.
