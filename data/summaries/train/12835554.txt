Aditya is seemingly living every Indian man's dream. He's married to a stunning, traditional wife, Ashwini and has a bright young boy. But he is having a relationship with his secretary, Geeta Menon who has a wild personality. He manages to balance both the ladies perfectly with clever lies. He promises Geeta he will marry her, after divorcing his wife Ashwini. On one of their romantic excursions, Aditya takes Geeta to his friend's bunglow at Mudisland. All seems fine until Geeta shocks Aditya with news that she is pregnant. Worried, he insists that they cannot have a child together and suggests an abortion. This attitude enrages Geeta and they engage in a fight in which he pushes her and she accidentally hits her head against a hard object, the force of which kills her instantly. He disposes of her body and returns home, behaving as if everything is normal. His former wild lover returns as a ghost who will stop at nothing till she gets her revenge. She appears often to frighten Aditya. Ashwini notices her husband's fear of a ghost whom she cannot see. To relieve his guilt, Aditya admits his affair with Geeta- and her death- to Ashwini. His wife's reaction is to leave but she is then admitted to hospital due to a major accident. Geeta returns to the frame and gives her forgiveness to Aditya. Ashwini recovers but Geeta's revengeful soul has transferred into her body.
