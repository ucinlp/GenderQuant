In the quiet suburbs of an English town, seventeen-year-old Jo Halliday lives a fairly boring life working as a hairdresser and living at home, with her nagging mother, pompous father, and fitness obsessed Aunt. Her father, an accountant, continually wishes that his dreamy, untidy daughter could be more like his secretary Miss Jones. One morning the local newspaper reveals that she has authored a book - The Naked Revolt - which is an instant bestseller. It tells the story of a young girl who discovers the truth about her family and neighbours, and flees to London to become a prostitute. Unfortunately the town's residents believe the book to be a true reflection of the family. Her father finds himself under suspicion at work, as his colleagues believe he has been stealing money, and her mother is regarded as a harlot who has been conducting a twenty year affair with a retired army officer who gives her driving lessons. Her local Doctor is painted as a philanderer who is sexually involved with a number of his patients while ignoring the desperate advances of his drunken assistant, Jo's Aunt. In fact none of these things are true, her father is scrupulously honest and in love with her mother. The local Doctor is a shy man, and the former army officer is simply a driving instructor. Jo has left town for London with a young playwright who is interested in turning her book into a play. After discovering they are kindred spirits, the two become engaged. When they return home Jo is confronted by her angry family and neighbours. The Doctor is threatening to sue, and her father and mother have even begun questioning each others fidelity.
