U.S. Air Force test pilot Major Bill Allison  flies an experimental aircraft to sub-orbital spaceflight successfully but loses radio contact. He lands at his airbase that now is abandoned and seems old and unused. Mystified by his surroundings, he sees a futuristic city on the horizon where he is rendered unconscious and captured by the inhabitants. Allison discovers that he has entered a wormhole through time and has landed in the year 2024 that contains survivors from a cosmic plague that hit the Earth starting in 1971. The inhabitants of the dystopia who are dying out live in an underground city called The Citadel. They are led by the Supreme  and his mute and telepathic granddaughter Princess Trirene . Against them are the literal outsiders, the bald violent mutants who seek to kill everyone they can. Also present are similar accidental time travelers labeled "scapes"; the Russian Captain Markova  who came from 1973 and General Kruse  and Professor Bourman  who have come from 1994 to escape the plague of the time.
