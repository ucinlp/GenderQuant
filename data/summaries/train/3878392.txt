The film depicts the escape of a downed Royal Air Force air gunner through German-occupied territory. Although the film is short , and generally only of interest to Hitchcock completists, it is interesting for its use of multiple viewpoints of the same events, a technique not unlike that used by Akira Kurosawa in Rashomon  and Fernando Meirelles in Cidade de Deus .
