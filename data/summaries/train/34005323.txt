In a family of IAS officer mother  and advocate father  there are two sons â€“ Arun and Vishnu who look similar. The hasty nature of the IAS officer mother separates the family and Arun goes with mother and Vishnu stays with his father. The confusion and hasty nature of mother is high in son Arun as he grows up in life. He wants to become an IPS officer but he starts Security Agency. He falls in love with Katherine  but suspects her. The suspicion what Arun's mother had is imbibed in son. That leads to various complications and his admission to mental asylum. He is treated by the doctors for his psychogenic amnesia. In the case of this disease the patient believes that he is alright but he is suffering from hallucination and thus confused state of mind is a big question mark for the doctors. In the case of Arun, his brother Vishnu  takes up the case and he had to pretend a lot of things to bring his brother in order. At the end Arun is made to believe so many things and he comes out from the big shock he received to his brains. Arun is taken to custody as he has killed his wife and her brother in a fit of anger when his mother dies from a fall. At this point Arun receives a blow to his head. That is the main cause for all the developments in the film.
