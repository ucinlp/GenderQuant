The wheelchair bound Doctor surrounds himself with an entourage that including Judy's aunt, and erstwhile brothel madam, Olga , dwarf Frederick  and numerous zombie bikers thugs. Dr Storm also has a Rolls Royce fitted with a giant blade that decapitates escapees and interfering parties. Abraham  arrives at the Horror Hospital "looking for his chick" and is promptly whacked around the head by the motorcycle zombies.
