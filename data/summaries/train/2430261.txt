The film is based on the fate of the brigantine Albatross, which sank on 2 May 1961, allegedly because of a white squall. The film relates the ill-fated school sailing trip led by Dr. Christopher B. Sheldon , whom the boys call "Skipper". He is tough and teaches them discipline. He forms a close connection with all-American Chuck Gieg , troubled rich kid Frank Beaumont , shy Gil Martin  and bad-boy Dean Preston . When a white squall threatens their ship, the boys must use what Skipper has taught them to survive the horrific ordeal.
