Ellery Cushing  has trouble at home, and at work. When he's fired from the newspaper where he’s worked for fifteen years, his friend Phil  quits too, outraged. Together, they work from their “office”, on a park bench, until Phil can get Ellery a try-out, on a radio spot, as “Uncle Dudley”. The character is a big hit, with his folksy witticisms. Meanwhile, at home, Ma, Mrs. Cushing , has her hands full with their daughter, Ruth , who has spurned Phil’s attentions for an aging Lothario, Jerry . While their oldest son, Robert , after turning down a job, has got mixed up with some “Red” rabble-rousers, in the park. Only their youngest son, Tommy , manages to stay out of trouble, doing his homework. Tommy thinks their Dad is alright, even better than “that guy on the radio”, who they don’t know is their father. It’s only after “Uncle Dudley” gets a concussion, after being hit with a brick, quelling a riot of “Reds”, in the park that his family begin to value his worth, and, Phil’s, if they all live to appreciate it.
