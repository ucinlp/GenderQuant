Rahul , Priyanka , Qateel , Bagani  and Vishaka  are medical college students with carefree attitudes. Rahul and Priyanka's failed relationship is shown in flashbacks. The group goes to a village in rural Maharashtra that is struck by farmer suicide. There they work as medical interns in the village hospital. The group plans a vacation to Goa until they are awoken to the plight of the poverty-ridden villagers by the village doctor, Mukya . In addition to their torment, a cruel zamindar  and his son  trouble the villagers with excessive interest rates. As a solution, a reformed criminal  offers monetary aid to the oppressed in form of microcredit loans. This comes as an able ally to students who vow to help the villagers. However, naxalites and corrupt politicians complicate their efforts. How these socially-awakened students rise above these problems forms the rest of the story.
