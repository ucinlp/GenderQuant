Buzz Blackwell, Fred Johnson and Axel Swenson are construction workers who are building a bridge. They are good friends and Buzz and Axel even help Fred raising his daughter Patricia. When Fred tragically dies in a fatal accident, Patricia is forced to live with her relatives in New York City whom she has never met. Buzz and Axel decide to depart with her. They soon arrive at her uncle and aunt Jarvis and Brenda, who are horrible persons. Jarvis is a snobby rich man, while Brenda is supercilious. Jarvis has received a letter from Buzz, warning him for their arrival and wants no part in raising Patricia. As they show up, Jarvis pretends to be someone else and sends them to the other "J. Johnson". This is Joe, Patricia's great uncle and husband of Marian. They are poor ex-vaudevillans but welcome them with open arms. Buzz wants to give Joe Fred's money he left him for Patricia, but finds out a drunken Axel used that money to buy a Swedish restaurant. This restaurant, which is doomed to fail, is now the only money bringer for the Johnsons. Buzz is determined to help them out and turns the restaurant in a night club, but is bothered with Jarvis, he has returned to claim "his" money back.
