An aging, respected commander Paul Blanchard, played by Charlton Heston, is on his final submarine tour before promotion to command of a submarine squadron . Surfaced and returning to port, the submarine USS Neptune, is struck by a freighter in heavy fog, and sinks to a depth of 1,450 feet  on a canyon ledge above the ocean floor. A United States Navy rescue force, commanded by Captain Bennett , arrives on the scene, but Neptune is subsequently rolled by a landslide to a greater angle that does not allow the Navy's Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle  rescue submarine to complete its work. A small experimental submersible, Snark, is brought in to assist with the rescue. Snark is very capable, but run by a nonconformist U.S. Navy officer misfit, Captain Gates . The tiny submersible is the only hope for a rescue. Ronny Cox plays Neptune{{'}}s executive officer, scheduled to take over command from Charlton Heston{{'}}s character; Ned Beatty plays Snark's second crewman; and Christopher Reeve appears in his first film role in a bit part that a sharp-eyed viewer might notice. In the opening credits, footage of the real-life submarine {{USS}}, filmed specifically for Gray Lady Down, depicts the fictional USS Neptune. Gray Lady Down also re-used submarine special-effect footage and the large-scale submarine model originally used to portray the fictional submarine USS Tigerfish in the 1968 movie Ice Station Zebra to depict USS Neptune.
