Sam Leonard is the new kid at Bridgeport High School. On his first day, he is humiliated by the school jock Kyle Plunkett, becomes friends with Annie Dray, and falls in love with Kyle's girlfriend Vicki Sanders. When he goes to the guidance counselor for guidance, the counselor gives him the advice to lie to get the other kids to like him. Sam tells lies like "I drive a Porsche", "My dad's a rock star", "My dog ate my homework", "I never miss a shot"  and that Vicki Sanders and his English teacher Mrs. Moran are lusting after him. That night, after an argument with his parents, he accidentally breaks the mirror behind his door. The next morning, Sam finds his dog actually eating his homework, he has a Porsche, he never misses a shot, and Mrs. Moran and Vicki Sanders are after him. Now he must find a way to fix what he's created.
