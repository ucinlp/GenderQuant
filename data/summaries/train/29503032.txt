A range war is building in Wyoming. Caught on opposite sides are Sam Brassfield, who builds fences to protect his grass land, and Clay Mathews, a cattle baron determined to keep an open range. Both men argue their case before the cattlemen's association to President Chester A. Arthur, who happens to be in Cheyenne for a visit. A hired gun of Mathews picks a fight with Brassfield's top man, Johnny Quatro, in a saloon, then vows revenge after Brassfield intervenes. Brassfield proposes marriage to Sharleen Travers, who runs a neighboring ranch with her brother Harry. At first the spineless Harry sides with Mathews, but after a scolding from his sister, he apologizes to Brassfield. A while thereafter, the hired gun Bodine shoots and wounds the unarmed Harry, then kills Sharleen in cold blood. Another rancher mistakenly blames Brassfield for a raid that Matthews ordered. He changes sides after overhearing Brassfield speak on his behalf to the President. In a final showdown, Brassfield urges Mathews to keep the dispute between themselves, then outdraws Mathews in a gunfight. Bodine also pulls a gun, but Quatro shoots him down.
