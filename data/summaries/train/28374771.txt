Georges Méliès walks onto a stage and brings out his assistant Jeanne d'Alcy. He spreads a newspaper out on the floor and places a chair on top of it. He then has Jeanne sit in the chair and spreads a blanket over her. When he removes the blanket, she has disappeared. He then waves his arms in the air and conjures up a skeleton. He places the blanket over the skeleton and removes it to reveal Jeanne, alive and well.
