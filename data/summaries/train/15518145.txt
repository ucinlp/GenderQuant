Through the day, misfortune seems to meet him at every turn. When he meets up with his dad Frank , things get worse. Tony's lie seems to have put a curse on what should otherwise have been a simple day of fishing for everyone.

She remembers the honorable man she married, and armed with large amounts of grace, remains supportive.
