Created and performed entirely by Vincenzo Perrella and Dan Osborn, with music written and performed by Adrian Kingwell, it is made in the style of an expository film. It ostensibly represents Perth as ‘the greatest city in the world’, while an enthusiastic voice over is contradicted with images of an empty city. It also suggests a fantastical element to the city by referring to ‘Old Bertie’, a mythical Kracken that lurks in the Swan River.
