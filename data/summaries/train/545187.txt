An earthquake strikes the city of Los Angeles. Mike Roark , head of the city's Office of Emergency Management, insists on coming to work to help out with the crisis, even though he has taken vacation with his daughter Kelly . His associate Emmit Reese  notes the quake caused no major damage on the city, but seven utility workers are later burned to death in a storm drain at MacArthur Park. Despite the city's Department of Public Works insistence that the incident had nothing to do with the tremor and was just an accident, Roark tries to halt the subway lines which run parallel to where the mishap took place as a precaution. Metro Chairman Stan Olber  though refuses, feeling there is no threat to the trains. Against regulations, Roark and a colleague Gator Harris  venture down the storm sewer in the park to investigate. They are nearly burned to death when hot gases suddenly flood the tunnel. Geologist Dr. Amy Barnes  believes a volcano may be forming near the city with magma flowing underground, but cannot come up with enough evidence for Roark to take action.
