A spoiled child television star steals Sach and Duke's car. After retrieving the vehicle, the duo "teach the kid a lesson". Television executives, who are disgruntled by the child, are impressed by the duo who are then hired to watch after the boy. The child's uncle/manager is not happy with Sach and Duke's influence over the child so he gets the two fired and then kidnaps the boy for ransom, to cover up his stealing the boys earnings. Sach and Duke then rescue him.
