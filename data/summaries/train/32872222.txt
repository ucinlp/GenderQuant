After the park guests leave, Donald and the bears all wave goodbye, except for Humphrey, who's asleep on a hammock. He and all the bears reside in their cave for their winter hibernation, but Humphrey is kicked out for being disruptive. He decides to sleep in Donald's house by pretending to sleepwalk and sleep in Donald's bed. Wise to his actions, Donald sets fire to Humphrey's rear end with a lantern and tries nailing him out, but Humphrey returns through the window when his nose gets stuck on it. Humphrey tries hiding in the shower, but retreats after being exposed to hot water. He then hides in the kitchen oven, but again gets caught by Donald who kicks him out for the last time. After having some toys thrown at him, Humphrey disguises himself as a baby to return to the cave, which is a success, but to the other bears' disappointment, who cannot sleep because of Humphrey's snoring.
