The film follows the dreams of 48-year-old Simohamed who works as a parking guard and his 17-year-old son Ayoub, who acts in Hollywood films such as Charlie Wilson's War and with Hollywood actors like Brad Pitt. When Ayoub's dreams of going to Hollywood are dashed, he turns to music and forms a hip hop group with his father. Like fish out of water, the duo set out to meet their heroes, enter studios and radio stations for the first time in an adventure through the music industry of Casablanca.
