After a successful Sydney bank robbery, the man in charge  plans a further and larger robbery, hoping that he can trust his less-than-competent gang. Two young BMX experts, P.J.  and Goose , and their friend Judy , all apparently on school holidays, discover and steal a box of police-band walkie talkies that the bank robbers were hoping to use to monitor on police traffic. With the police unable to track the stolen radios, and the kids unaware that the robbers are now tracking them, the kids are caught by the thieves, but escape. They are finally arrested but escape police custody to launch their own plan. The film boils down to a cartoonish chase across opportunistic sites around Sydney, including a memorable escape down the Manly Waterworks water slides, complete with BMX bikes. The film was also known as Short Wave for American bootleg distribution.<ref namehttp://www.abc.net.au/news/arts/articulate/200602/s1576298.htm | publisherMovie Minutiae: BMX Bandits  | firstKemble | date12 April 2010 }}
