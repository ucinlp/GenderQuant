In a plot reminiscent of 1947's The Invisible Mouse, Quacker is a singing duck whom George bought for Joan. After nearly being swallowed alive by Tom when George and Joan are out at dinner, Quacker escapes to Jerry's mouse hole, where the two become friends. When Tom catches Quacker, Jerry trips Tom up with some extension cord, causing Tom to lose his grip on Quacker, sending him straight into a tub of vanishing cream. An invisible Quacker is able to come to Jerry's rescue, where he shows him the secret of the vanishing cream. Thus invisible, the two gleefully torment and bamboozle poor Tom by teaching him a lesson as they eat his watermelon, vanish and seemingly cut half of his tail off with a pair of scissors, and leave him with a short tail, and force him to eat aspirin, and kick him out of the house, until he overhears their secret and renders himself invisible, and finally when Jerry and the duck think Tom is gone, he hits them both with a coal shovel, enough to give Jerry and Quacker their defeat and comeuppance.
