A career military attorney, Lt. Col. Adams, is brought in to defend Lt. Winston  for murdering a British soldier in India. The commander informs Adams that the Army would like the case to quietly go away and to put up as little defense as possible so that the court can move for a quick conviction. While investigating the crime, Adams discovers that Winston is completely insane. Along with the US Army, the British are also anxious to see Winston hang and have no real interest in seeing justice done. So, as the title suggests, Adams finds himself in the middle of two military units and must decide if he should just let the case be whitewashed so that the Army can save face and the officer can save his reputation or put up a real and compassionate defense.
