In the 1950s, Lyne Danner, whose father was in the military, goes to high school in Missouri with Tyler Hart. They both enjoy rock and roll and, together with Mookie and Dotson, form a band called The HartAches. The conservative parents are upset by this. Although Tyler already has a girlfriend, he and Lyne are attracted to each other. The band travels to Memphis and eventually gets a recording contract and prepare to go on tour. Record executives Moses and Elaine Gunn want Lyne out of the band, and insist that Tyler record songs by established artists. The band objects to making money that African-Americans deserve, but Tyler goes off on his own. Tyler succeeds in his career but loses his friends, while Lyne's career takes off later. Lyne's friend Marsha performs in a Supremes-style group and becomes a freedom marcher in Alabama.
