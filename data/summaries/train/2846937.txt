This film takes place in an apocalyptic land of the future known as The Wheelzone. In this place there are no cars and people travel on skates and skateboards. The plot of this film traces the exploits of Hawk Goodman , who is on a quest to rescue several young ladies from the grasp of the evil overlord Pharaoh . Because this film was composed of footage taken from the other two features associated with this project, The Legend of the Roller Blade Seven follows a very similar storyline to The Roller Blade Seven, with a few elements added from Return of the Roller Blade Seven. Most notably, a very extensive fight scene where a large number of combatants battle with samurai swords and martial arts.
