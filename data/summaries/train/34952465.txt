Nanguila Tomorrow follows the steps of a young Malian man, illustrating the detrimental effects of rural exodus. The film also questions the government’s decisions immediately after obtaining independence in its attempt to put a stop to the wave of people immigrating to the cities and to develop the country based on agriculture. A portrait of Mali in the sixties by means of the nightlife in Bamako, the capital’s monuments, women bent under the weight of too many tasks, Nanguila Tomorrow is regarded as the first Malian film.{{citation needed}}
