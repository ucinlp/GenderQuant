In Bougival Junction, New Mexico in 1880 the Francophone town is led by Marie Sarrazin. A new family arrives, calling themselves the Millers, but in fact they are the daughters of the hanged outlaw Frenchie King and his eldest daughter Louise seeks to keep her father's name alive by donning men's clothing and continuing his criminal ways. Louise and Maria fight but when they are both jailed they team up to take revenge on the town's men.Crawley, Bébé, p. 231
