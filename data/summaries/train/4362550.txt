When call girl Claudia Draper kills client Allen Green in self-defense, her mother Rose and stepfather Arthur attempt to have her declared mentally incompetent by Dr. Herbert Morrison in order to avoid a public scandal. Realizing if her parents succeed she will be remanded to a psychiatric facility for an indefinite period of time, strong-willed Claudia is determined to prove she is sane enough to stand trial. The attorney her parents hire to defend her quits after Claudia assaults him, and the court appoints public defender Aaron Levinsky to handle her case. She resists him as well until she comes to the realization he is on her side. Aaron begins to probe her background to determine how the seemingly pampered child of supposedly model upper-middle-class parents could find herself in this situation, and with each piece of her past he uncovers he receives additional disturbing insight into what brought Claudia to this crossroads in her life. He discovers that she was sexually abused frequently by her father as a young girl.
