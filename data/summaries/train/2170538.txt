The story follows a tug of war between two underworld gangs trying to outsmart each other. Chinna’s  gang—the smaller of the two—, struggles to overtake Periyavar’s  gang, until a man named Sekar  gives Chinna’s gang new life. Sekar is a man of steel, physically and mentally, who had idolised Chinna in his childhood; he is similar to the character Bhima from the ancient Hindu epic Mahabharata. Sekar challenges Periyavar’s group and puts Chinna on top. The gangs are then targeted by the new police commissioner . Sekar later leaves the fight to settle down with his girlfriend Shalini , but although Chinna wants Sekar to lead his own life, his gang members want him back. In the film's final climax, Chinna's gang members kill Shalini; Sekar retaliates by killing Chinna, and the police then kill Sekar.
