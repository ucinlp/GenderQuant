The Estonian teenager Joosep  is being bullied by his entire high school class. The class continually beats Joosep, and harasses him in other ways as well, such as fully undressing him and then pushing him in the girls' changing room. Fellow classmate Kaspar tries to protect him and breaks from the group, which results in the violence being directed to him as well. Also, in a homophobic atmosphere Joseph and Kaspar are ridiculed for supposedly having gay feelings for each other. Nevertheless, when the school administration and Joosep's parents try to find out who is to blame for the treatment Joosep has been receiving, the class unanimously but falsely accuses Kaspar of mistreating him. After Joosep's parents find out that their son is being beaten while attending school, the father tries to encourage his son to fight back, and demonstrates a fighting technique by giving the boy an additional beating. Joosep's mother informs the school administration. At last the class as a whole is rightly blamed. Out of revenge for this, the class assembles on a beach, calling both Kaspar and Joosep there by writing emails to them showing each other as fake sender. Once there, they force Kaspar to fellate Joosep, at knife point, and photograph the sexual act without showing the knife. The boys decide to avenge themselves. Joosep steals two pistols, a bolt-action rifle and ammunition from his militaristic father's gun safe, and the two proceed to school, where they massacre the students responsible for their torment. To their regret they also accidentally kill a girl from another class. Finally Joosep and Kaspar, facing one another, each aim a gun at their own head, decide to commit suicide together after counting to three. Joosep pulls the trigger and dies, but the film ends with Kaspar still standing there with his gun aiming at his head.
