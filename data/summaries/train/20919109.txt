When World War One breaks out in the Middle East, Turkish and German troops kill the father of Frenchwoman Juliet Rouget. She goes into hiding dressed as a boy and starts spying on the Germans. Three members of the Australian Lighthorse, Red, Larry and Jim, are enjoying themselves on leave in Cairo when called to fight the Turks. They take part in several battles including the march to Ogratina and the Battle of Romani. Red meets Juliette when she is disguised as a boy but later realises she is a woman. They fall in love. The Battle of Gaza takes place; Jim and Larry are mortally wounded and Red is captured. During his captivity, Red discovers some invaluable information about the Germans. Juliette rescues him and they spend the night together in a hut. Jim manages to rejoin his unit in time to participate in the charge of the Light Horse at the Battle of Beersheba. The Germans and Turks are defeated and a wounded Jim is reunited with Juliette.
