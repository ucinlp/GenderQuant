Jamal quickly becomes a star on the court, and his overall attitude changes drastically as well. He learns to play with a team rather than just himself. While becoming successful with the Banshees, Jamal also finds himself in a problematic relationship with his teammate Michelle , whom he has romantic feelings for but cannot act on because Michelle knows him only as her confidante, Juwanna.
