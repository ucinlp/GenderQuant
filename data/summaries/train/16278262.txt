Vijaya meets Vedachalam and confronts him. He accepts the charges and introduces her to his wife and son as his friend's daughter. Vijaya also agrees to pretend to be his friend's daughter.

Having lost the proof of her birth, the now-recovered L Vijayalaksmi meets her boyfriend, Sundaram  and seeks his help. Since his father is against love marriages, Sundaram puts her up temporarily in a hotel. Dr. Tirupathy  is Vedachalam's family physician and he sees a “Missing” ad placed by Vijaya's uncle and tries to find out who she is. Meanwhile, Ravi meets his real sister in the hotel with Sundaram. Being Sundaram's friend, he tries to help the couple without revealing his relationship with L Vijayalakshmi. At his suggestion, Sundaram takes L Vijayalakshmi home claiming that he ran over her and that she has lost her memory as a result of the accident. Sundaram calls in Ravi who pretends to be a doctor and they convince Sundaram's father ([[V. K. Ramaswamy  that if he does not help treat L Vijayalakshmi, Sundaram will be jailed for the accident. So she stays in the house, and they give her a new name, Rathi. Since Ravi has to return to Ooty, Sundaram, his father and Rathi move there as well. There Ravi tells Sundaram's father that she is Vedachalam's daughter. He also advices him to get his son married to Rathi on the quiet since her father is much wealthier than him and may not agree to the marriage. Rathi wants Ravi to attend the wedding but he says that he is having a registered marriage with Vijaya on that day. Being anxious to get his son married to the wealthy Rathi as soon as possible, Sundaram's father promises to conduct both weddings together at his expense. Meanwhile, there is a little bust up as Dr. Thirupathy's wife  informs Vijaya's uncle about her whereabouts and he kidnaps her on the wedding day. However, Dr Thirupathy, Ravi and Sundaram rescue her and return to the wedding venue.

Ravi then steps forward and explains that she is not the daughter but Rathi is. Sundari forgives Vedachalam, accepts Rathi and both marriages take place.
