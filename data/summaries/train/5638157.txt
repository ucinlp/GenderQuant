Norris and Gossett play Max Donigan and Leo Porter, two soldiers of fortune, whose adventures seem to almost never result in any notable gain, are befriended by an inscrutable woman of mystery Patricia . Patricia's map leads them on a quest for treasure in Central America. The name of the movie comes from the powerful guardian of the treasure. This movie is famous for a fight scene in which Norris singlehandedly defeats almost every male customer in a Mexican bar and destroys the bar in the process. Another aspect of Norris' character is his inability to properly use a firearm; in one scene, he kills a savage by pure luck after misfiring, the result was the bullet bouncing off the walls before hitting its target.
