Deon is a football player who suffers a deadly disease. However, despite receiving love and praise for his entire life due to his athletic ability, he is still a good person who loves his family and is willing to share the glory on the football field. His mother Bee is incredibly proud, his younger brother Sean is understandably jealous, and Bee’s boyfriend/Deon’s surrogate father Eric sees the football star as a winning lottery ticket. Even though Deon is fighting cancer he still tries to finish what he started.
