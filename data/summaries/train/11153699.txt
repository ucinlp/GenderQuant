{{Expand section}} I Really Hate My Job is the story of the lives of five waitresses stuck in a second-rate London restaurant with delusions of grandeur. Customers come and go, unaware of the real concerns of these women; a rat or two in the kitchen, bitter arguments about life and art, as well as a coup d’état in the kitchen... all overshadowed by the anticipation of a booking by a famous Hollywood film star.
