Florence Fallon  is outraged when her minister father is fired after many years of selfless service to make way for a younger man. She tells the congregation what she thinks of their ingratitude. Her bitter, impassioned speech impresses Bob Hornsby , who convinces her to become a phony preacher for the donations they can squeeze out of gullible believers. She builds up a devoted national following. Then, she meets a blind John Carson , falls in love, and the whole rotten sham comes tumbling down.
