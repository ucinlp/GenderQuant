After seven years, lawyer Nick Arden  has his wife Ellen , missing since her ship was lost, declared legally dead so he can marry Bianca . It turns out however that Ellen was merely shipwrecked on a deserted island, and has been rescued. When she returns home, she learns that Nick has just left on his honeymoon with his second wife. When Ellen tracks him down before his honeymoon night, he is at a loss as to how to break the news to Bianca. He keeps putting off the unpleasant business. Meanwhile, Bianca becomes frustrated by Nick's odd behavior  and calls in a psychiatrist, Dr. Kohlmar ([[Pedro de Cordoba . Further complications ensue when an insurance adjuster  mentions to Nick a rumor that Ellen was not alone on the island, but had the company of a Stephen Burkett  and that they called each other "Adam" and "Eve". When Nick confronts Ellen, she recruits a mousy shoe salesman  to pretend to be Stephen, but Nick has already tracked the real, appallingly virile and handsome Stephen down. Nick tries to explain the situation to Bianca and Dr. Kohlmar, but they do not believe him ... until he is arrested on a charge of bigamy. In court, Judge Bryson , the same judge who had Ellen declared legally dead and also married Nick and Bianca, annuls the second marriage. By this time, Ellen is no longer sure of Nick's feelings for her. Stephen asks her to marry him and return with him to the island, but she still loves Nick. In the end, Nick and Ellen are reconciled.
