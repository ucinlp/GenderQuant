Aziz  was born in France, the child of unknown parents. Gathered up by gypsies from the area north of Marseille, he has grown up as a Moroccan national. Jean-Pierre , is a civil servant in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He is being cheated on by his wife who is having an affair with his boss and he no longer feels attached to his Parisian life. It is given to Jean-Pierre to 're-integrate' Aziz, a stolen baby, raised by gypsies, neither Arab nor gypsy, into his 'native' country of Morocco. Aziz is an interesting client for him. But Aziz is just a young man without sure roots who has never set foot in Morocco, though he affects to belong to the tribe of the Grey Men of Irghiz who live in a forbidden city high in the Atlas Mountains. And the two rootless men make the acquaintance of the sparkling Valerie  who will act as their guide.
