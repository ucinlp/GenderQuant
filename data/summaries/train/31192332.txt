The film charts the build up to the 2010 races, and then documents each of the races and their results. These take place along public roads through the Isle of Man, covering 37.73 miles of terrain, and packed with thousands of spectators who have come from all over the world. Using 3D technology, Closer to the Edge captures the drama and speed of the 2010 races to show what motivates these adrenaline addicts, who live and breathe road racing. Guy Martin's appearance is notable as the maverick with a unique take on life. John McGuinness appears, a racing legend and the most successful living rider, winning the TT fifteen times. Conor Cummins is one of the Isle of Man’s most prominent stars, truly living the dream. Ian Hutchinson is a relative newcomer whose career has invited interest. In 2009 “Hutchy” won two TT's in one day and another important road race, the North West 200, in Northern Ireland as well as competing every week at the top of the British Superstock Championship. The film reveals how for more than 100 years riders have flocked to the Isle of Man in search of thrills, glory and triumph. The narration tells how the TT has always called for a commitment far beyond any other racing event, and since the race began over 200 people have made the ultimate sacrifice in their quest for victory. The second half of the film introduces Bridget Dobbs, mother of two and widow of Paul Dobbs  who died in the 2010 races. Bridget understands and accepts that her husband, like many others, died doing the thing he loved the most in life. Despite the near fatal injuries, the film shows how those that survive all want to go back and do it again.
