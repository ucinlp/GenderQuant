In the small Florida town of Pakoe, the body of teenager Shannon Davis is discovered with its head sawed off. As more victims turn up, the police organize neighborhood patrols in an effort to prevent further deaths. Meanwhile, tree surgeon Charlie Puckett returns home after surviving a freak accident involving a chainsaw that has left him facially disfigured and somewhat brain damaged. Charlie hides his disfigured face with a potato sack complete with goggles. He soon becomes a prime suspect in the murders due to his unsteady mental state and arsenal of tree-trimming implements.
