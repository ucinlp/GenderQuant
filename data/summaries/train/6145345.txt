The deceased lycanthrope Waldemar Daninsky is revived to life when two doctors remove the silver bullets from his heart while performing an autopsy on him. Waldemar transforms into a werewolf, kills the doctors and escapes from the morgue. Some time later, two students, Elvira and her friend Genevieve, go searching for the tomb of medieval murderess  Countess Wandessa. They find a possible site in the castle of Count Waldemar Daninsky, who invites them to stay for as long as they like. When he shows them the tomb of the countess, Elvira accidentally revives her. Daninsky turns into the Wolf Man, is forced to battle and destroy the vampire queen at the end of the film, and is himself destroyed by a woman who loves him enough to end his torment. Daninsky's lycanthropy is not given a specific origin in this film; the events of the film are assumed to have followed from the ending of Fury of the Wolf Man , which involved a yeti's bite as the cause of Daninsky's curse.
