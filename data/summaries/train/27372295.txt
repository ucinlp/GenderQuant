A man enters a restaurant. The waiter makes him soup. When he brings his dessert, the waiter's dog runs into the restaurant and eats everything that is on the table. While the cook prepares a pie, the waiter forces the dog not to rush to the table. But the dog has all the same started to eat the pie after it has been served to the man.
