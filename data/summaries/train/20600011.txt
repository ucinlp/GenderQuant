The White Man and his dog enters the little island in the middle of the ocean; then all of a sudden, the dog's tail points at the top of the tree and the White Man looks up and sees that big muscle person on top of the coconut tree, so the White Man uses his rifle and shoot the muscle person out of the tree, then coconuts hit his head. Then, the Pink Panther comes and he hears the gunshots that was in the background, and made himself look like a tree, but the White Man didn't see him except the dog. The dog barks at him and Pink uses a water gun to spray the dog, so the dog went to get the White Man to show him what he saw. In the ending, the White Man tries to cover the explosives but it goes off and the island sinks to the bottom of the ocean. When the White Man and the dog are sitting on a log in the middle of the ocean, the Pink Panther comes out of the water then breathes deep back underwater with his umbrella.
