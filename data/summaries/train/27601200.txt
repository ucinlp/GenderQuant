After the flotilla attempts to bring humanitarian assistance to Gaza refuses to turn back, it is attacked by the Israeli military. In a dramatic battle scene, activists resist and are mowed down by the Israeli soldiers. A Turkish commando team led by Polat Alemdar  travels to West Bank in Palestine, where they launch a campaign against Israeli military personnel in an attempt to track down and eliminate an Israeli general, leader Mo≈üe Ben Eliyezer , who is the responsible for the flotilla raid.
