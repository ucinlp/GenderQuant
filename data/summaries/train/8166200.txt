The Stooges run a tailor shop that is about to be repossessed by the Skin and Flint Finance Corporation. When the Boys hear about a big reward for fugitive bank robber 'Terry "Slippery Fingers" Hargan' , they think that catching him might end their financial woes. Hargan conveniently ducks into their shop as the officer enters and leaves a suit with a safe combination in its pocket. After his girlfriend  fails to retrieve the combination, Hargan returns with his henchmen, and a wild mêlée follows. The Stooges miss out on the reward but wind up with the crook's bankroll to pay off their debts.
