Star Lacrosse player Conor Sullivan  is not excited about moving to an unknown town and being the new kid at high school. He has a new love interest Brooklyn , but he struggles to find a meaning to his life. Conor's Marine father is redeployed into Iraq where he dies in combat leaving Conor in shock and denial as he starts acting out in self-destructive ways. This greatly worries his mother Claire . There is also a violent on-field clash with a long-time nemesis  and a vandalism incident that lands him in a jail cell and finally gets him kicked off the team. To regain his obvious passion for the sport, he goes for arduous training in a wilderness Lacrosse camp. The camp is under the tutelage of his dead father's old combat buddy, Sgt. Major Duke Wayne , who opens Conor's eyes to the true meaning of maturity, sportsmanship and manhood.
