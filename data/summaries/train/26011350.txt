In Nagasaki, Tora-san and an acquaintance help an old woman who has fallen and injured herself. She invites them to her home where the three share a night of eating and drinking. The old woman's health deteriorates and she dies. At her funeral, Tora-san falls in love with the old woman's daughter, but winds up acting as a go-between for her and a young law student.<ref name  http://www.kinejun.jp/cinema/id/24250|title2010-01-31|languageKinema Junpo}}<ref name Stuart |last Stuart Galbraith IV|urlTora-san 35: Tora-san's The Go Between  |date2010-01-31|publisher=DVD Talk}}
