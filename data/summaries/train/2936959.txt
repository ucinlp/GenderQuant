Fairfax , is a ruthless, South African criminal mastermind, prone to quoting Shakespeare, who is intent on collecting a series of four interlocking electronic devices that can somehow "shift the balance of power in the world." He manages, through deception and violence, to acquire three of the devices. On one occasion, unbeknownst to her, busty protagonist and helicopter pilot Carrie Wisk  has shuttled two of Fairfax’ goons to the site of one of their raids. Fairfax then sets his sights on the fourth device, which is tucked away in the Zitex building, an 86-floor skyscraper in downtown Los Angeles. Wisk is again called to pick up a pair of VIPs, who this time turn out to be Fairfax himself and his assistant Jacques . She takes them to the Zitex building, where, in a movie cliche double-cross, Fairfax mortally wounds Cranston , the possessor of the final device. Cranston escapes and meets up with Wisk on the roof, where he entrusts her with the device, admonishing her to keep it away from Fairfax at all costs. The well-endowed Wisk hops on a window washers’ rig and crashes through a window, then stashes the device in a trash bin. Comparisons are drawn between the large-breasted and good Wisk, and Fairfax's flat-chested and evil henchwoman, who Wisk invariably defeats. Meanwhile, Wisk’s LAPD officer husband , who’s been investigating the strange goings-on around town, heads for Zitex, fearing for his wife’s safety. Wisk’s husband leads Fairfax’ men on a chase around the building before being rescued by his better half. Fairfax finds the device, kills Jacques and heads for the roof, where Wisk engages him in a kickboxing showdown which ends with Fairfax’ 86-story fall to the street below.
