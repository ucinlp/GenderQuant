Bugs Bunny is vacationing in the Ozarks and stumbles into the territory of two hillbilly brothers Curt and Punkin'head Martin. After having several of their hunting attempts foiled, Curt and Punkin'head Martin are determined to get revenge on Bugs for their humiliation. Bugs easily outsmarts them and eventually leads them into a violent square dance involving repeated slapstick comedy gags. The square dance song starts as a straight forward version of "Skip to My Lou" while the jukebox band starts and plays and Bugs dances in a dress. Then Bugs deliberately unplugs the jukebox and takes over the fiddling and square dance calling, still to the melody and rhythm of the song before saying "And that is all." before the cartoon ends.
