A new husband shares a house with his wife and mother-in-law and a second man . The first scene shows favoritism at the breakfast table to the second man, but whilst he reads his paper the table is rotated to ensure a good cup of coffee for the husband. At work the husband chats up his secretary Mae Busch and is discovered by the second male who calls his mother-in-law. A car bought for the secretary is given to the wife as a gift to stall her, but the secretary demands it back. Action moves to a private booth in a restaurant/dance hall where a similar evasion act ensues. A car chase ensues followed by the "Tri-Stone Kops" an evolution from the earlier Keystone Kops.
