Pablo aka "El Bola"  http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Jos%C3%A9_Ballesta is a twelve year old boy who suffers abuse by his father . His violent family situation prevents him from having friends at school until a new kid, Alfredo , arrives at school. The warm, caring atmosphere in Alfredo's family provides a stark contrast to Pablo's oppressive situation under his father. Soon, Pablo finds a different reality in his new friend's family who teaches him to confront with courage his worst fears.
