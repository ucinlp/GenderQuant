At a hunting lodge retreat, banker Hubert Kingery  announces to five fellow officers that one of them has forged documents and embezzled $500,000. Before the evening is over, Kingery is shot dead and the police officially rule it a suicide. Kingery's daughter Gwen  doesn't agree and asks for help from her aunt's nurse, Sarah Keate , who suggests her detective boyfriend, Lance O'Leary , for the case. O'Leary has all of the suspects return to the lodge and begins his investigation. Stuck in the snowbound shelter, the suspects and victims begin to pile up.
