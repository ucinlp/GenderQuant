Vamshi  is a hair stylist who falls in love with Nandini , sister of Bhoopathi Rayudu , a good hearted factionist. Vamshi and Nandini decides to get married only with the consent of their elders. So Vamshi comes to Juturu, a village in Rayalaseema to convince Bhoopati Rayudu of his love with the latters sister. Initially Bhoopati doesn't like Vamshi and everyone laughs at Vamshi when he says that he is a hair stylist in city.

Even after Vamshi convinces Bhoopati, he is worried on how to convince his parents. Uday is son of a Justice , a person who believes that one should not go beyond the law and hate corrupted ones. How the pair and Bhoopati convinces the Justice is really amazing to watch.
