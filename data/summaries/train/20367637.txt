Colombia is in chaos, as a five man team of US Navy SEALS embark on a secret mission to ensure that peace talks between the country's government and insurgent guerillas don't erupt into violence, an unforeseen complication threatens all out war. Out of nowhere, the meeting falls under attack and the leaders from both sides are killed. The SEALS have been framed for the crime, leaving them to fight for their lives from behind enemy lines against the Colombian Special Forces. Abandoned by their government and left for dead, the weary soldiers race to uncover the evidence that will prove their innocence while ensuring that the violence is contained. Should the fighting spill over the border, the entire region or both sides could be plunged into a nightmarish inferno of war and death.
