Deputy John Johnson   is a rookie in the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department and the first black deputy  at the station to which he is assigned. Racial tensions run high in the department as some of J.J.'s fellow officers resent his presence. His only real friend is the other new deputy , the first female officer to work there , who also suffers similar discrimination in the otherwise all-white-male work environment. When J.J. becomes increasingly aware of police corruption during the murder trial of Teddy Woods , who he helped to arrest, he faces difficult decisions and puts himself into grave personal danger in the service of justice.
