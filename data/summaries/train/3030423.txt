The film starts with Dupont's daughter on an aeroplane with a stewardess  bending over her. As she leaves we see Bud saying something to her which we do not hear. He puts her in the back of a Rolls-Royce and drives off. They stop at a junction and Leer gets in. The girl realises she has been kidnapped. Bud  starts to have second thoughts, and tries to protect the girl when Leer  starts getting out of control. Bud also has to deal with the lack of courage with the head of the operation and Vi  who uses drugs and cannot be trusted. Then things start to unravel. Leer kills all his partners in crime on their return with the ransom, the car going on fire. But Bud, perhaps anticipating this betrayal gets out early. Hiding on the beach he is able to exact revenge and shoots Leer as he signals to a ship waiting to take him from the country. All is revealed to be a dream during the girl's flight, sparked off by Vi the air hostess. But then she meets Bud in the airport just as in the dream...
