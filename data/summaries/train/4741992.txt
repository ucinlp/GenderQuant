Based on actual events of the early twentieth century, the story concerns a grueling 700-mile cross-country horse race in 1906 and the way it affects the lives of its various participants. The colorful contestants include two former Rough Riders  who can't let friendship come between them if they intend to win, a lady of little virtue  with an ulterior motive, a punk kid , an old cowhand in poor health , an English gentleman  who's competing just for the sheer sport of it all, and a Mexican with a toothache  who literally needs to bite the bullet. All must race against a thoroughbred of championship pedigree owned by a wealthy man  who has no intention of seeing his entry lose. The film touches on the themes of sportsmanship, animal cruelty, the yellow press, racism, the end of the West and the bonds of marriage and friendship. As the race progresses, the conditions test not only the endurance of horses and riders but also their philosophies of life and the meaning of victory and defeat.
