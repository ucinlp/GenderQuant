God Is My Co-Pilot was based on the best-selling autobiography by fighter pilot Col. Robert Lee Scott Jr. , who fought in the Pacific during World War II. At 34, Scott was considered too old to fly in combat, but he volunteered for a secret bombing raid from the Philippines against the Japanese capital of Tokyo. When the mission is cancelled after he arrives in India, Scott flies transport aircraft over The Hump into China. Scott persuades Claire Chennault , the leader of the Flying Tigers to let him fly with the airmen such as "Tex" Hill  who have been fighting the Japanese as a mercenary air force. Scott gets his chance to fight, ultimately engaging in combat with the deadly fictional Japanese pilot known as "Tokyo Joe" .
