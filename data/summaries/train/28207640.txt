Betty Boop stars in her own version of Little Red Riding Hood. Betty prepares before going to visit her grandmother's house, despite being warned of wolves wandering the woods by the trees. Betty Boop continues through the woods. A hungry wolf spots Betty and follows her with a knife and fork. Bimbo sees the wolf who is about to attack Betty and kills him before he can do any harm to Betty. Bimbo then turns up before Betty at her grandmother's house. Bimbo waits for Betty disguised as the wolf and her grandmother. Betty then turns up inside her grandmother's house and sings "Where'd You Get Those Eyes?" and is then lifted up in the air before Bimbo reveals himself to her.
