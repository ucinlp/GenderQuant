Fifteen years ago, Edwin  went to clown camp to fulfill his lifelong dream of bringing laughter to the world, however nobody laughed. Humiliated on graduation night, Edwin viciously murdered the entire camp before vanishing into legend. But, despite the warnings of the town drunk, Bonzo  has reopened the ranch and a new class of clowns have unwittingly signed up. When their die-hard instructor Sgt. Funnybone  is found dead in a puddle of cream pie and blood, the curriculum changes from comedy to survival. Edwin slashes, stabs, strangles, and disembowels the clowns while laughing insanely at his own bad jokes.
