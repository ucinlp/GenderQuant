Sasha, a fighter of IDF's Golani Brigade, receives a notice that he is accepted for officers training. He goes out to celebrate this notice with his friend Glory. The two soldiers are new immigrants of Russian origin, with no relatives in Israel. Some time later, two men are arrested, charged and convicted of selling weapons to Hamas, which were used to carry an attack in Hadera, which killed five civilians. The two fighters, who are perceived as traitors do not want to lose their honor as fighters in IDF, and request a retrial. But the military system is not interested with these desires, and decides to release them from the army and transfer them to a civil prison, to continue serving their sentences. This causes them to take over a cell block, take as hostages three of the prison's personal and requests a retrial. During these events, they confide in one of the prison's personal, a woman soldier named Ilanit, that Sasha did not sell any weapons, but had forgotten his personal weapon at whore that he visited when they celebrate. To help him, Glory stole a weapon from the unit's arsenal and handed it to Sasha, so the fact that he has lost his own weapon will not be known.
