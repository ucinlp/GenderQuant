While working as a porter at Union Station in Los Angeles, the Pink Panther is forced at gunpoint by the Little White Man to assist him ina burglary at the Acme Manufacturing Company. While the man tries to break into the safe, the panther notices a large magnet above a rolling production line, and uses it to get the thief's purse. When the man notices it, he orders the panther to give the purse back, but the panther uses the magnet to catch and drop the man onto the production line. Later, while cutting a hole in the safe with a welder, the panther sets the pipe to the gas bottle on fire, which results in a huge explosion.
