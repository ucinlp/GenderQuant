Following the death of her mother, Tess Silverman travels to Drover's Run, the farm where she spent the first few years of her life. Drover's is a rural cattle property in South Australia, to reconnect with her only remaining family, her father Jack and her sister Claire, whom she has not seen in 20 years, since her mother left Jack and moved to the city, and taking Tess with her. Tess arrives in a complex situation and finds herself meeting an adoring father but a hostile sister whom she no longer knows and who resents her sudden arrival and even quicker ability to win over Jack, something she herself has never been able to accomplish. Tess is content with making her visit a short one and continue on to Venice to move on with her life but the sudden death of their father forces Tess and Claire to overcome their differences and the many obstacles before them to realise their father's dream of running Drover's Run together.{{cite web}}
