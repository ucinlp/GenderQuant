Lars ' is a 25-year-old guy who is going nowhere in life. He is a life guard in a swimming hall in the eastern parts of Oslo . Lars just wants to do good, but his abilities aren't always up to the challenges. He is well-meaning but his temper is easily and violently triggered — a problem which Lars has had for all of his life. Together with his best buddy Jørgen ' he has a troubled adolescence in his past history. Jørgen is transitioning to adult living cohabiting with his partner and children, whilst Lars is still living the bachelor's life with soccer and beer being core ingredients. One day Lars has an uncomfortable incident in the swimming hall. He recognizes an acquaintance from his past, Hans ', a middle aged man with a reputation of "fiddling" with the teenage boys in the neighbourhood. Lars alerts Anja ' who is the manager of the hall and also Jørgen's live-in partner, that Hans is a menace and needs to be barred from using the facilities. Anja instead figures that Lars needs to get his act together and stop making uncorroborated accusations. Next Lars acquaints Tim ', a boy who has been with Hans. Lars then erupts, losing his rationality overcome by rage.
