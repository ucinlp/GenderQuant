Ansel  is a wanna-be artist, full-time dishwasher who isn't nearly as good a painter as he thinks he is. When he quits his menial, but stable job washing dishes to pursue his art career, girlfriend Tallulah  is furious. They break up and Ansel spends his days creating horrible art  and trying to earn government grants. Meanwhile, Talluah is being driven crazy by her upstairs neighbour who constantly plays "Layla" Eric Clapton at a loud volume. Banadek  is Ansel's former co-worker and dishwasher. He spends the course of the film talking about the process of dishwashing. To him it is a religious experience. The film consists of the two main characters discussing their breakup in monologue, mixed with scenes of the two going through typical post-break up rituals, like giving back each other's possessions. Eventually, they come to a realization about themselves, and their roles in each other lives.
