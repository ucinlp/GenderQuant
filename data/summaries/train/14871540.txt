A star-studded cast check in for Christmas at the fictional Riviera Hotel in Eastbourne. The leading role is taken by Shearsmith, who plays Ashley Dodds, the assistant manager of the Riviera, who can barely hide his excitement at finally being given the opportunity to take charge of the hotel over the festive period. Consequently, he's determined to make it the establishment's best Christmas ever, but he doesn't count on the guests - a hotchpotch of individuals with an array of problems. These include man-eating divorcee Avril , who is looking for love; long-suffering Rita  and her cantankerous husband Maurice ; the Reverend Miles Roger , a serial philanderer whose latest escapade is being investigated by the Daily Mirror and his alcoholic wife ; and father and son Dennis  and Tim Dunn , who have their own reasons for not wanting to be at home during this emotional time. All of these individuals, together with a series of mishaps at the hotel, ensure that Ashley's time in charge is a stressful one.
