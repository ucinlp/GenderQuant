Joan Webster  is a young middle-class Englishwoman with an ambitious, independent spirit. She knows where she's going, or she thinks she does. She travels from her home in London via Manchester to the Hebrides to marry Sir Robert Bellinger, a very wealthy, much older industrialist, on the Isle of Kiloran. When bad weather postpones the final leg of her journey—a boat trip to Kiloran—she is forced to wait it out on the Isle of Mull, among a community of people whose values are quite different from hers. There she meets Torquil MacNeil , a naval officer trying to go home to Kiloran for some shore leave. They spend the night in the nearby home of Torquil's friend, Catriona Potts ([[Pamela Brown . The next day, on their way to catch a bus into town, they come upon the ruins of Moy Castle. Joan wants to take a look inside, but Torquil refuses to go in. When she reminds him that the terrible curse only applies to the Laird of Kiloran, Torquil introduces himself: he is the laird, and Bellinger has only leased his island. As the bad weather turns into a full-scale gale, Torquil takes advantage of the delay to woo Joan, who becomes increasingly torn between her ambition and her growing attraction to him. Desperate to salvage her carefully laid plans, Joan tries to persuade Ruairidh Mhór  to take her across to the island immediately, but the experienced sailor knows conditions are far too dangerous. Joan manages to bribe young Kenny  into attempting it by offering him enough money to buy a half share in Ruairidh's boat and marry Ruairidh's daughter Bridie . Torquil learns of the scheme and tries to talk Joan out of it, but when she proves adamant, they quarrel, then he invites himself aboard. The boat's engine gets flooded and they are caught in the Corryvreckan whirlpool, but Torquil is able to restart the motor just in time and they return safely to Mull. At last, the weather clears. Joan asks Torquil for a parting kiss before they go their separate ways. Torquil enters Moy Castle. Centuries earlier, Torquil's ancestor had stormed the castle to capture his unfaithful wife and her lover. He had them bound together and cast into a water-filled dungeon with only a small stone to stand upon. When their strength gave out, they dragged each other into the water, but not before she placed a curse on all the Lairds of Kiloran. Any MacNeil laird who dared to step over the threshold would be chained to a woman to the end of his days. From the battlements, Torquil sees Joan marching resolutely toward him behind three pipers, and meets her for an embrace.
