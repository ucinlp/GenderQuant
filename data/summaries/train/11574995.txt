The film opens in 1683 Massachusetts where three women in the town of Devonsville are kidnapped by the townsfolk and systematically tortured and executed. After the final woman's execution, her apparition appears in the sky and a thunderstorm begins. Then, 300 years later, Dr. Warley  investigates the witch's purported curse on Devonsville. Three liberated, assertive women move into town, which angers the bigoted, male-dominated town fathers. One of the women is a reincarnation of the witch, who proceeds to exact revenge on the town males. Meanwhile, Dr. Warley fights a supernatural illness resulting from his lineage to the town's founding fathers who were responsible for the execution.
