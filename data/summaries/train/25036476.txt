In a quiet meadow, Charlie, a unicorn, is resting peacefully, before he is awakened by two other unicorns. One unicorn is pink and the other blue, and both speak in high-pitched, breathy voices. As Charlie awakes from his slumber, the other two unicorns inform him that they have found a map to the mythical "Candy Mountain," and that he must come with them on their journey. Charlie initially refuses, and goes back to sleep. The blue unicorn begins to bounce on Charlie, insistent that he should come, and both begin to pester him with details of the mountain, causing him to begrudgingly give in to their demands. The trio begin their journey in a forest, where the two lead Charlie to a Liopleurodon; the two unicorns converse with the Liopleuridon, who supposedly guides them on their quest with a simple roar. The trio then crosses a bridge, much to the delight of the pink and blue unicorns. When Charlie finally gets to Candy Mountain, the letter Y of CANDY sings a song, to the tune of the Clarinet Polka, imploring Charlie to go into the cave. When the letters explode, Charlie reluctantly goes into the cave. The other unicorns say goodbye as Charlie is locked inside and knocked out. When he awakes in his original spot, he realizes that they have taken one of his kidneys, followed by the end and credits.
