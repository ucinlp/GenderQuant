A young woman named Clea Lake becomes a pawn of the sorceress Morgan le Fay. The primary defender of our world against threats of a magical nature, the Sorcerer Supreme, is presently a man named Thomas Lindmer. He and his pupil and friend, Wong, contact a psychiatrist named Stephen Strange, who is the heir to his father's potential to become Lindmer's disciple and the next Sorcerer Supreme. Strange bears his father's magical ring as a sign of this, and he has already sensed something wrong, but does not recognize the importance of these feelings of apprehension. Lindmer must convince Strange of the reality of the mystical world wherein the battle between good and evil is played out on a magical level, all unbeknownst to the mundane world, to save Clea and thwart Morgan's plans.
