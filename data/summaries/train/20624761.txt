The Thai have defeated the Khmer empire in the mid-18th century and taken the lovely Princess Tarawatee prisoner. Seeing her beauty, the Thai ruler weds her, but then later sees her in the arms of another man. He sentences them both to death – one through beheading and the other to be burnt to death. While waiting for her execution, the Princess hears from a fellow inmate that in a small village not too far away lives a young woman called Daow who is her exact physical double. As flames start to burn around her, the Princess sends her spirit to inhabit the body of Daow – but just as her spirit zips off to find her double, Daow is killed by a voodoo-like curse – and the spirit ends up inhabiting a deceased body – but it soon springs to life, surprising everyone around it. The body is now partly Daow but also partly vengeful ghost – and at night a painful hunger comes upon it and it desperately needs to feed on blood and entrails – and so the head slips away from the body for a little refreshment. This soon causes consternation among the villagers.
