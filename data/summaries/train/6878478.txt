Riddled with guilt over the loss of his rock star older brother, 16 year old David Forrester  becomes obsessed with death, leading his misguided parents to send him to Driftwood, an "Attitude Adjustment Camp for Troubled Youths" run by the sadistic Captain Doug Kennedy  and his brutal young henchman, Yates . Once there, David becomes haunted by the spirit of Jonathan , a former inmate who met a mysterious end; a mystery whose resolution could very well be David's only way out.Movieweb: DVD announcement and review of "Driftwood"
