The residents of a large town are inexplicably turning into rhinoceroses. Stanley , a mild-mannered office clerk, watches the bizarre transformations from a bemused distance. But soon the strange occurrences invade his personal space, as his neighbor and best friend John  and his girlfriend Daisy  become part of the human-into-rhinoceros metamorphosis that is taking place. Eventually, Stanley realizes that he may be the only human left amidst the new rhinoceros majority.<ref name9500E0DB103DE13ABC4A51DFB766838F669EDE “Film: Absurdity of Ionesco's 'Rhinoceros' Is Reduced in Transition to Screen,” New York Times, January 22, 1974]
