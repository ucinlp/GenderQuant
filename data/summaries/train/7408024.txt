The series finale is a self-parody in which the characters gather to celebrate the conclusion of the story, only to be interrupted by The Author, a "cameo" of Yu Azuki. The Author reminds them that they still have to play the big baseball game between Kin'gyoku and Ōgyoku. The action immediately warps to the baseball field and a surreal match ensues, featuring ninja baseball techniques, Nazi and Native American baseball players and a battle between the mechas of the Kin'gyoku Vice Principal and Maejima  This fight is cut short by Saizō in the guise of the Buddhist statue, who spirits the mecha away and commands the school rivalry ended before departing in a flying saucer.
