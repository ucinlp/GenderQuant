While taking a stroll through a local park, the Pink Panther comes across a small bird looking for a ride south for the winter. It soon becomes apparent that the little fellow cannot fly and, what is worse, is scared of heights. The witty panther then goes about devising several ways to get the bird in the air. First, he attaches a propeller to the bird's beak. When that fails , the Pink Panther then tries to lower the bird from atop an apartment building, with a parachute attached. This fails when the little bird floats in the direction of a hungry alley cat tries to make the bird his lunch. Other options, like tying a balloon to the bird, are also tried. Finally, when all else fails, the Panther books the bird an airline ticket, allowing the bird to truly "fly" south for the winter.
