Bor, once the largest copper mine,Official website of RTB Copper Mining and Smelting Complex Bor but now just the biggest hole in Europe. Small union protest over the mine privatization is taking place. The plot revolves around Toda and Stefan, two best friends, skaters, who spend their first summer after finishing high school. Stefan's going to Belgrade to the University in fall. Toda says he wouldn't apply to the University even if he had the money. They spend time shooting "Jackass-like" videos they call Crap and hanging out with their friends and Dunja, their friend who came back from France for her holidays. Toda and Stefan get into a quiet battle for her attention and in that strange relationship of dying friendship and rivalry they try to get ahead of each other. Toda gets injured during one of the stunts and goes to a hospital where he learns that he has to apply to the employment bureau in order to get health insurance since he’s not a student any more. There he gets a counselor and has to attend meetings on which he will learn new methods of job application. That’s how Toda is forced into the bureaucratic world of adults. Spending more time at the counselor’s than with his friends makes him annoyed and his quarrels with Stefan slowly become more violent. But when the small union protest evolves into a huge riot their destructiveness will tie them together once again.
