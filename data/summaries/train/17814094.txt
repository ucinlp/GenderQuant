The story begins when Afghanistan was invaded from the north by the former Soviet Union in 1979 and large number of Afghan refugees began crossing over into Pakistan. One such caravan brings Saima to this land of political unrest. Deeba Begum plays Shaan's mother, and Saima is his fiancée. In the war ravages, Deeba and Saima are lost to Shaan, and come to Pakistan. They camp in a small town, which is on the Pak-Afghan border, the tribal chief of which used to frequent their town once, and his son, Moammar Rana falls in love with Saima. Meanwhile, the war is halted and Shaan, the true fiancé, comes to this shantytown looking for his mother and his fiancé. You can well imagine what transpires after that. The Afghan war pales in front of the weaponry and ferocity that is witnessed between Mommy Rana and Shaan, after that.
