Chantel Mitchell  is an African-American, 17-year-old high school junior who lives in Brooklyn, New York. Chantel is very smart and articulate, although her sharp tongue, abundant ego, and occasional naivete undermine her efforts. Her ultimate dream is to leave her poor neighborhood, go to college, and eventually become a doctor. Throughout the movie, Chantel breaks the fourth wall and states that she wants to be seen as more than just another teenage black girl on the subway. Hence, the "I.R.T." in the film's title stands for "Interborough Rapid Transit Company", and specifically references the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway system. However, there is only one scene in the film where Chantel is actually in the subway. She lives with her struggling working-class parents and her two younger brothers. With her mother working during the day and her father working the night shift and hence sleeping all day, Chantel is given the responsibility of taking care of her brothers in addition to going to school full-time and working a part-time job at a local grocery store. However, she earns mostly A's and B's in school, and is fully determined to receive an education beyond her primary one. Much to the chagrin of her teachers, she wants to graduate early in order to get into college as soon as possible. Her dream is tested with her constant clashes with her school's administration, and her recent romantic involvement with her seemingly-rich boyfriend Tyrone . She becomes pregnant and undermines herself with false confidence and lack of real worldly knowledge.
