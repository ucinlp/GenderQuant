Dark clouds crowd the sky above an endless metropolis. This is Thelomeris, city of cogwheels and clocks. The citizens live to operate the clock factory and create energy for making even more clockworks. No one knows why the city was established, who built it or how long it has existed. Its ancient bordering walls and looming skyscrapers silently reach for the sky. Enormous metal cogs work at the heart of the clock factory, as it casts dark shadows onto the city. The biggest and most influential man of Thelomeris, MAN1 is the factory's owner. His job is to operate the factory while studying time.

Just before he relents, she suddenly becomes ill. No one knows the cause of the disease. His only hope is to go against time, changing its course and in this way, change her destiny. A mysterious person, 'Stranger'  who offers a solution to eluding fate.
