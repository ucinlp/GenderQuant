Several hundred years into the future, mankind has been relegated to the position of a minority species being replaced by a clone-race called "homo-technis", which is itself being supplanted by the genetically engineered race "homo-superior" or "Konstrukts". The Konstrukts have banded with the Nephilim, a race of hostile extraterrestrials who are known for their superior military skills, to wipe out all the homo-sapiens and homo-technis "lesser" races from the galaxy. In order to save the "lower" races, homo-technis develops a genus of sapiens called "breeders", with an ability to bring multiple births to term quickly. The Nephilim manage to destroy all of earth's "breeders", save one man and one woman. As a "breeder" himself, disgraced military man Derasi Vorde , has the duty of bringing the last female "breeder" from earth to the safety of an off-world rebel base.
