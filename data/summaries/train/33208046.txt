Dr. Whitaker has disappeared after working hard on an innovation which could give either the West or the East an edge in the Cold War. Lemmy Caution, although currently otherwise busy, is assigned to return the scientist. He is advised to start searching for him by finding in the first place Dr. Whitaker's attractive young fianc√©e Geraldine. Of course Lemmy Caution finds the scientist, beats up the villains even while actually being hopelessly outnumbered, puts everything right and gets the girl.
