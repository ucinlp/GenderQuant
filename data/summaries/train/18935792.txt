Sam Dietz  is a rookie Los Angeles detective recently transferred from New York City. He is paired up with veteran detective Bill Malloy  in order to find and stop a serial killer. The killer is Arthur "Buck" Taylor , the son of a former LAPD cop whose motive for killing is frustration over not having been accepted to the force and failure in the eyes of his father. Taylor chooses his targets by randomly looking up their names in the phone book and skillfully covering up his tracks by using his skills and knowledge that he learned while on the force. While in pursuit of Taylor, both Dietz and Malloy become his next planned targets for murder.
