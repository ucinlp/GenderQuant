Tony  runs a small science fiction video store bordering on bankruptcy; his relationship with Natalia  is getting worse as time goes by, because their interests have diverged. One day, Tony goes to a science fiction convention where a well-known writer FÃ©lix Cadecq's  comes to give a chat on his latest work. When he starts his speech, the writer makes a surprising declaration: it's worthless to keep writing science fiction novels, because he has found a new portal; a real and simple way to reach the stars. "Listen to my new CD-book and try it yourself", he proclaims. This announcement is not well received among his estranged fans; but Tony, touched by curiosity, buys Cadecq's CD in order to test what he said. From that moment on, Tony's life will never be the same. He feels bizarre sensations, he gets to know surprising people who assure him they know the way to escape from the alien fleet coming to Earth. Finally, Tony starts a trip heading to the star Proxima Centauri, but what he finds there is not exactly what he had expected.
