Lucy  is a self-confessed tomboy that is considered one of the guys with her masculine haircut and attitude. She gets on well with her father  but is frequently separated from him for months on end when he works in Canada. Her relationship with her mother  is easy-going provided she keeps the house tidy. Her mother's lenience even allows her daughter to drive her car, even when she is too young to apply for a license. As Lucy turns 14, she becomes more in tune with her sexuality and her family dynamics. She develops a type of friends with benefits relationship with her best friend Kenny. She also ditches her tomboy image, embraces make-up and grows out her hair. She begins to realize that her parents marriage is not as solid as she had imagined. She realizes that her father's extended stays abroad are not typical of other fathers. Furthermore she realizes that her mother does not pine for her father as much as she does herself. In fact, her allegiance to her father is tested when she discovers her mother is enjoying a romance with a colleague. She pro-actively seeks sexual satisfaction after she is left with a void when Kenny has to move away. She also begins to realise that there is more to her father's extended stays in Canada than she had previously imagined.As Cool As I Am by Pete Fromm Bookslut. March 2004
