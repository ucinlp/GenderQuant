The film is centered on an old world Manhattan cafe during a busy brunch shift. A number of patrons populate the cafe, with patrons at each table representing a different genre of film, such as romantic comedy and tragedy. The storylines then begin to overlap and converge as the characters eavesdrop on each other.
