Holmes is visited by Mr. Chalmers, an insurance agent with a strange tale. Seven elderly single men, calling themselves "The Good Comrades", live together in the remote Scottish castle of Drearcliffe House, near the village of Inverneill. Recently one of the "Good Comrades" received a strange message, an envelope containing nothing but seven orange pips. That night, he was murdered and his body horribly mutilated. A few days later, the second envelope was delivered, this time containing six pips, and the recipient also died mysteriously soon afterwards, his battered corpse being recovered from the base of the cliffs. Chalmers holds Â£100,000 of life insurance policies on the seven men, and suspects that one is systematically murdering the others in order to collect the money, and begs Holmes to investigate. Holmes and Watson arrive at the scene only to find another murder has occurred. This man received five orange pips, and his body was burned to a crisp. Lestrade also arrives to investigate. Despite Holmes' best efforts, three more deaths occur, each time leaving the victim's body unrecognisable. Lestrade jumps to the obvious conclusion, that the last surviving member, Mr. Bruce Alistair, murdered all the others. However, after Watson goes missing, Holmes has deduced the truth and leads Lestrade  to a secret room where all the "Good Comrades" - alive and well - are hiding with Watson tied up. Holmes explains that Alistair was the victim of a plot to frame him for murder and collect the insurance money by the other six.Davies, David Stuart, Holmes of the Movies  ISBN 450 03358 9 They even killed the local tobacconist, Alec MacGregor, because he didn't believe in ghosts and saw one of the presumed-dead comrades on the beach alive and wrote a note to Lestrade. Unfortunately, the note was intercepted and read before it reached Holmes.
