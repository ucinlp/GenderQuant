The film is about a TV company that is planning on making a new Reality TV show called Real TV. The show they are working will have the contestants living in an uninhabited part of Norway without any help. In an effort to create bonds between the members of Real TV's production team, Gunnar, the boss, decides that they should try it for themselves. Gunnar takes the crew to an old cabin in the woods, far from any contact. To make sure that the crew are living with the same conditions as the real contestants will have, Gunnar takes away all of their cellphones and cigarettes. While scouting out the area around the cabin, Lasse  and Per stumble upon an abandoned camp site. Near the site, Per finds the body of a dead woman in the depths of the lake. After telling Gunnar about the dead girl, he pressures them to keep their mouths shut, so that they don't scare the other team members and ruin the whole trip. After they head back to their cabin and night sets in, things become even creepier.
