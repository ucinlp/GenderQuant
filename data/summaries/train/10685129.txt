The Pink Panther secretes himself inside Gamble's Department Store so that he can sleep in the building overnight. A janitor turns up on the scene, forcing the panther to hide from him. A series of gags involving the various items the store has for sale ensues. After being hassled somewhat by these situations the janitor quits his job. All seems goos until a new janitor starts, forcing the panther to start the process all over again.Beck, Jerry.
