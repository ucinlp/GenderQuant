The film is narrated by a troubled Edgar Allan Poe . It begins with Poe's attempts to confirm a ghost story by examining the ghosts' tombs; however, he doesn't go too far to avoid being haunted and killed. Later, a journalist named Alan Foster  visits Poe to drive him out of madness, but he is forced to challenge the horror writer on the authenticity of his stories. This leads to Foster's accepting a bet from Lord Blackwood to spend the night in a haunted castle on All Soul's Eve. Foster is surprised by ghosts who appear to be half-humans, in very effective and horrifying special effects. Ghosts of the murdered inhabitants appear to him throughout the night, re-enacting the events that led to their respective deaths and driving Foster to madness. He meets the following ghosts: Elisabeth Blackwood  who falls in love with Foster; the annoying and easy-to-hate Julia ; the rough criminal William Perkins ; and the most despicable one of all, Dr. Carmus . Near the end of the film, the ghosts reveal their true nature: they aren't actually ghosts but vampires with ghostly powers, and they need Foster's blood in order to maintain their existence. Because she loves him, Elisabeth tries to save Foster by aiding his escape. He succeeds in escaping the castle, but not the garden... Distracted and careless, he pushes the door so hard that he is smashed between the two gates and is sliced to death by razors on the main gate. But at least he isn't transformed into a vampire.
