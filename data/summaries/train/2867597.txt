Although starring actors, the "Bills" were shown to be a "miniature" family, with many of the jokes revolving around the characters' small size and the challenges they faced living in a "large" human world, as well as scenarios where Mr. Bill is subjected to the various abusive situations the original Saturday Night Live character was best known for.
