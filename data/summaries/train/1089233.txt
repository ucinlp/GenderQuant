In this movie, Dudley "Booger" Dawson  is getting married to his Omega Mu girlfriend Jeannie , but the father of the bride tries to stop them, as he is not keen on welcoming the likes of Booger into his family, despite the fact Dudley would be a good husband to Jeannie as they share many common interests. Jeannie's father works with his loathsome son-in-law Chip  to find a way to discredit Booger and cause Jeannie to call off the wedding. Lewis Skolnick and the other nerds discover the conspiracy and work to save Booger's wedding ceremony from being torpedoed. In a subplot, Lewis' wife Betty is pregnant with their first child, and is in her third trimester as the wedding date approaches. A part of the plot where Booger is trying to find the origin of the accusation that he fathered an illegitimate child reveals that Dudley Dawson was born in Akron, Ohio. The child is from Sandusky, Ohio, where Booger spent much of his life. In the end, Jeannie's mom tells her husband that she will leave him if he does not support his daughter's wedding to Booger, and Chip's accusations fall apart when the little girl reveals she was "drafted" from an orphanage to play the illegitimate child role. Chip's wife decides to divorce him and throw him out of their lives forever, leaving Chip to swear his own revenge against the nerds. In the end, Booger and Jeannie are married, Betty gives birth to a healthy baby boy, and the newly married couple tell Heidie, the little orphan girl, they would like to adopt her.
