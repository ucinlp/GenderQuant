It is the first day of school and children are beginning school for the first time. Breezy Brisbane is returning for another year. His mother tells him that he is to study hard in school and that he will be president some day. He answers back that he does not want to be president and wants to be a street car conductor. Brisbane then visits the blacksmith who gives him some encouraging words. Brisbane makes a wise remark, angering the blacksmith who tells Brisbane of a kid that got expelled back when he was a child. Brisbane then gets some bright ideas to get himself kicked out of school. Brisbane tells Stymie to call Miss Crabtree "Crabby", tells Dorothy to give Miss Crabtree a note stating she is hard of hearing, and tells Wheezer to answer questions rudely. Brisbane also puts tacks on the seats, glues Miss Crabtree's books together, and blows a loud horn in the classroom. Spud then recites a poem honoring the teacher. Brisbane then throws a spitball at Sherwood. Miss Crabtree sends Brisbane out in the hall. Brisbane then brings Dinah the Mule inside the schoolroom. Miss Crabtree then punishes Brisbane and tells him to learn Sherwood's poem and recite every verse to the class. Brisbane refuses and Miss Crabtree suspends him pending expulsion. Brisbane then realizes that being out of school with no one to play with and nothing to do is not all that much fun. He then learns the poem and sincerely apologizes to Miss Crabtree. She still makes him recite the poem and he does so in tears. Then Marmalade accidentally brings in a skunk from outside and it sprays, sending the class all outside and eliciting a bugeyed reaction from Pete the Pup.
