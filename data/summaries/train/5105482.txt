A young man, Brendan , seeks work in a jazz club  owned by Finney . There is some suggestion that Finney has past connections with organised crime but is attempting to leave these behind. Two gangsters arrive to make Finney an offer 'he cannot refuse' for his club but Brendan overhears them and warns Finney, who then turns the tables on them. At the same time Newcastle is preparing to host a visit from a group of American investors that it hopes to engage in a grandiose regeneration project. Kate , a waitress, has been recruited to service the delegation. Kate and Brendan meet and fall in love. Among the visiting group is Cosmo  a corrupt businessman who we learn uses Kate as a prostitute to secure business deals. It is Cosmo who has been putting the pressure on Finney as the club stands in the way of his plans for the city leading to an eventual conflict. A subplot involves an avant-garde jazz group called the "Krak√≥w Jazz Ensemble" who visit Newcastle to perform and become entangled in the conflict. One of the film's longest scenes is a celebration to which the group is invited; this takes place among members of Newcastle's Polish community.
