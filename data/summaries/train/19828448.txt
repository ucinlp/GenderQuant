Moving out of their standard small-town surroundings, the gang visits the farm owned by Mickey's uncle. Here the youngsters attempt to milk a cow by placing two bottles under the udders and hoping that nature takes its course. If this weren't hilarious enough, the kids feed Mexican jumping beans to the chickens, are chased by an ornery mule, and end up stuck in a hay-baling machine.
