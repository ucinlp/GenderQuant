Set in August 1944 during the V-1 Doodlebug offensive on London, a murder takes place in Heron's Park Emergency Hospital, a rural British hospital somewhere in the Southeast of England. Joseph Higgins  dies on the operating table after being injured by a flying bomb. The anaesthetist, Barney Barnes , has had a patient die in similar circumstances previously. Inspector Cockrill  is asked to investigate when Sister Bates  is killed after revealing that the death of Higgins was not an accident. Cockrill states at one point: "My presence lay over the hospital like a pall -- I found it all tremendously enjoyable." Cockrill's investigation is hampered by the conflict between Barnes and Eden  because of their competition over the affections of nurse Freddi . After another murder attempt is directed at Freddi, the inspector restages the operation in order to unmask the murderer.
