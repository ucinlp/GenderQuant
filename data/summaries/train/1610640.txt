The original heroes in Final Fantasy V are now legends of the past, and a new evil, Deathgyunos, has risen on the Black Moon and must be dealt with. Mid, a recurring character from Final Fantasy V, contacts a new hero and heroine: Prettz  and Linaly . They eventually meet the sky pirate Rouge and Commander Valcus, commander of The Iron Wing.
