Manohara  is an unemployed youth who is always looked down on by his family. However his uncle is very supportive to him. One day in order to prove that he is capable of doing something in his life he invents electricity producing machine. Things goes wrong and his invention end up in damaging the public property and he lands up in prison. Later everyone starts to think that Manohara is mentally unstable. He starts drinking and even fights his close friend. While going home after the party he is mistakenly captured by the security staff of a rehabilitation centre instead of another person thinking that he is the same guy who escaped the mental facility . Some doctors manufacture new records to prove that Manohara is Mahendra and is suffering from mental disorder. During his stay at the rehab-centre, Mahendra accidentally sees Devika, a mental patient and falls in love with her. He escapes with Devika and spends three to four days roaming with her outside. Love develops between the two and Devika discloses her tragic flashback to Mahendra . At last, when he is released by rehab centre he had already won many patient's hearts and they are filled with tears to see him go out. Yograj Bhat has given a message in the end with the Punch dialogue by Devika to Manohara: "Look properly at the world not only you but everyone are mad and you are just one among." Actors like Raju Talikote and others with their comedy have added effect to the movie. Manasaare songs are slow and melodious and the lyrics are excellent.
