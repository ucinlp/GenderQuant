The Romans plan to capture Getafix to keep him from making the magic potion. In an effort to rescue him, Obelix accidentally puts Getafix out of action with a menhir, the impact of which causes amnesia and insanity. While the Gauls come to grips with this, a major storm sweeps over the village and a soothsayer named Prolix seeks shelter with them. He quickly deceives the more credulous villagers about the authenticity of his abilities and after the storm passes he sets up in the forest nearby. Asterix and Vitalstatistix desperately attempt to have Getafix brew the potion, resulting in explosions and the occasional flying cauldron — alerting the Romans that something is up. They send a camouflaged, and very reluctant, spy to investigate. He is quickly captured and used as a guinea pig for Getafix' less explosive concoctions. However one of these makes him lighter than air causing him to float away, and he reports their problem. The Romans send a patrol to investigate, and come back with the Soothsayer instead, however the villagers think the sceptical Asterix has driven him off. The centurion is quickly convinced that Prolix is genuine  and decides to use him to chase away the villagers. Soon Prolix appears at the gates and foretells doom if the village is not abandoned — all but Asterix, Obelix and a still crazed and potion brewing Getafix leave, going to a nearby island. Meanwhile Getfix brews a truly noxious potion whose vapours engulf the village, driving off the Romans who had quickly moved in, but also convincing them that the soothsayer had real abilities since the smell matched his prediction of pestilence. However when Getafix accidentally tastes some he is cured . Getafix brews the magic potion and convinces the villagers to test the soothsayer's reliability by attacking the Roman camp. The soothsayer is "menhired", the centurion demoted to the ranks, and the village goes back to normal.
