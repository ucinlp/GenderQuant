Laura invites her college friend Jacky out to her country estate for a costume party. What Jacky does not know is that she is a pawn in a demonic game. That evening she is drugged and taken out to what appears to be a black magic altar. The next morning she awakens with claw-like scratches on her legs and, when she tries to escape, finds she is trapped in this location. But why are her friends keeping her here and who do they truly serve?
