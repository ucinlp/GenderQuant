The film starts out with a futuristic Nomad from the year 3069 who accidentally discovers the book "Helter Skelter" while searching for food in a desert on the former site Los Angeles. He mistakes the book as the Bible, and reads it as if Charles Hanson , is the messiah. As he reads, we flash back to 1969 where Susan Hatkins meets Charlie during a bad LSD trip. Charlie then renames her Hadie and she is accepted to his family where they plan things to change the world, and make music. After finding out that the snobby, nature hating actress Sharon Hate is supposed to be filming a movie in the desert where they are living, Charlie and the family plot to kill her. Charlie claims to get messages through songs, such as I Want to Hold Your Hand by The Beatles, which tell him to kill Sharon Hate. Soon after brutally murdering Sharon Hate and her friends, Hay and Abigail, the family goes after the Ha Biancas, after Mr. Ha Bianca  decided to build a parking lot, which would cover the entire desert, in Sharon Hate's honor. They kill him and his wife, and are later found by the police in the desert, after which they have a trial and sentenced to death by gassing, electric chair, and hanging till dead. We go back to the Nomad in 3069 who carves an X in his forehead and uses Charlie Manson as a sort of Messiah.
