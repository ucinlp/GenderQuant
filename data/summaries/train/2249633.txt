American Intelligence officials have learned that Soviet spies have begun exploring a remote region of the Alaskan Territory in search of answers to the worldwide reports of "flying saucers", and convince a wealthy playboy, Mike Trent , who was raised in that area, to assist a secret service agent in exploring the area for the USA and determining what the Soviets are up to. To his pleasant surprise, he learns that the agent is a woman, Vee Langley , and they set off together, he posing as himself suffering from a nervous breakdown, and she posing as his nurse. They are met at Mike's family's cabin in the wilderness by a new, foreign-accented caretaker named Hans . Mike is skeptical of the entire UFO matter until he spots one flying close, nearby. He is less skeptical about his attraction to Vee. Meanwhile, Hans seems curiously determined to make him suspcious of Vee's affections. Assorted complications ensue until Mike and Vee finally learn that Hans is one of the Soviets' agents, trying to get flying saucer, an invention of an American scientist, Dr. Laughton. Laughton's assistant has other ideas. A communist sympathizer, he is trying to sell the saucer to the Soviet agents. Eventually, Mike and Vee locate the hiding place for the saucer, bring the spies to justice, and witness the flying saucer explode in mid-air, as one of the spies tries to escape with it, as a result of a bomb placed aboard it by the scientist.
