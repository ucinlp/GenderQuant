The film cuts between two seemingly unrelated stories. One, set in present-day Montreal, stars Kevin Parent as Antoine, a successful club DJ torn between his new girlfriend Rose  and his still-complicated relationship with his ex-wife Carole ; the other, set in 1960s Paris, stars Vanessa Paradis as Jacqueline, the fiercely protective single mother of Laurent , a child with Down syndrome who has a crush on Véro , a friend and companion who also has Down syndrome. The film builds toward the revelation of how the two stories are linked: after Jacqueline, Laurent, and Véro are killed in a car accident, Carole, Antoine, and Rose are their subsequent reincarnations.
