The film opens with a monologue by Fletch about his latest story, dealing with the drug trade on Los Angeles' beaches. While undercover, he is approached by Alan Stanwyk , who says he has inoperable cancer and wants Fletch to kill him so that his family will receive his life insurance. Stanwyk thinks that Fletch is the perfect man for the job, as he appears to be a person who can simply disappear after the shooting without any suspicions being raised. Fletch agrees to kill Stanwyk when offered $50,000, but is suspicious of Stanwyk's motives. Investigating Stanwyk, Fletch uncovers a story much greater than his expos√© of small-time drug dealers. As he uncovers the truth about Stanwyk's double life, he discovers that the police chief  is behind the drug trafficking.
