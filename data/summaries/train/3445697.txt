Based on the true story of Jessica McClure, the baby who fell down an abandoned water well while playing one afternoon in her back yard in Midland, Texas. She was stuck in the well about 20 to 30 feet down and it took rescuers 58 hours to get her out. There was fear that if they shook the ground too much with machinery they could cause Jessica to fall further down and die. Rescuers managed to successfully excavate alongside the well shaft and bring "Baby Jessica" to safety.
