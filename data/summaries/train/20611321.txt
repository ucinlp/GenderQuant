In a quaint village in the Swiss Alps, the little white man's incessant tuba-playing results in the entire community threatening to evict him. Taking the hint, the man and his loyal dog head for the mountains to practice his tuba in supposed seclusion. However, the tuba-playing disturbs the sleep of a tree-dwelling Pink Panther, who, unseen by the man makes attempts such as dropping a potted plant, bubble gum, cement, including soap and water into the tuba, crushing it with a rock and making it fall to him which makes him fall to a waterfall where his dog saves him. The man, undaunted, persists in playing and blames his dog for these attempts to silence the tuba.
