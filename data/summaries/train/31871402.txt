The teaching staff also were shaken of insecurity, accusing each other. Emma and Böbe are learning English in the evenings. Emma also sells newspapers and she has an affair with the married school director, who is not too brave to decide. One of the best scenes of the film when Böbe and many naked women - teachers and nurses - are waiting for casting in a film studio. Böbe is acquainted with foreigners and she trades in foreign currencies. Böbe will be arrested and she finally jumps out of the window of the teachers' accommodation. "Szabó's sensitive handling of the material culminates in a meditative passage in which Emma stands in church, musing on the 'passion for love' which masks lack of purpose. 'Collective sin' may be dead, according to Böbe, but this movingly delineates the private pain of atonement"- Time Out Film Guide.
