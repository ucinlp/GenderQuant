Michael , the narrator, is a lovable charmer with the soul of a con man who successfully scams his way into the pre-law program at Columbia University. In contrast to Michael's desire to leave the Brooklyn streets behind, his close friend Carmine  is a handsome lady-killer who is enamored with the Mafia lifestyle and wants only to stay there. Rounding out the trio is Bobby , an endearing cheapskate who longs for a simple life of working at the Post Office and settling down with his fiancee. While at Columbia, Michael falls for a beautiful young student named Ellen , a society girl whom he initially wins over with his preppy schoolboy cover. As their relationship blossoms, leaving the streets behind seems increasingly possible, but when Carmine catches the eye of Caesar , a feared Gambino family mobster who controls their neighborhood, Michael and Bobby are drawn into that world despite their reluctance to get involved.
