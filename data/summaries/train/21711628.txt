Michael Dublin  is a hustler whose wit and sarcastic nature does not endear him with clients whom he just swindled. After one heist that turns sour, Dublin is facing death when Katherine Parker  appears and takes down the man assaulting Dublin, nearly twice her size. Together Dublin and Parker begin a cross country fight tour that takes them through basement bars, county fairs, and eventually a big event in Miami.
