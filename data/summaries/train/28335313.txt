In a town on the French coast, English antiques dealer Maurice Lawes  is a witness to the night-time murder of a gendarme. The killer spots Lawes at his window, and realises he has been seen. The following evening, Lawes' daughter Janice  finds her father also murdered. An investigation is launched by the local police and a private insurance investigator Dermot Kinross . The initial assumption &ndash; that Lawes was murdered by the gendarme's killer to prevent identification &ndash; soon comes into question as several other individuals connected to Lawes are revealed to have plausible motives for the murder. Lawes' son Toby  is found to have been embezzling funds from his father to pay off a blackmailing ex-mistress; Toby's fianc√©e Eve , living directly opposite the murder scene, is investigated and found to have in her possession bloodstained clothing which she cannot satisfactorily explain away. Eve's ex-husband Ned  turns out to have a particular interest in a rare snuffbox from Lawes' personal collection which is discovered to be missing, and may have killed Lawes when disturbed in the process of burglary. Eve comes under particular scrutiny as it is considered she could have been an accomplice of either Toby or Ned. It falls to Kinross to unravel the actual chain of events and arrive at the correct solution.
