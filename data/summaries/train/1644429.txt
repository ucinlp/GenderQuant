The film stars Jean-Pierre Léaud as Paul, a romantic young idealist and literary lion-wannabe who chases budding pop star, Madeleine . Despite markedly different musical tastes and political leanings, the two soon become romantically involved and begin a "ménage à quatre" with Madeleine's two roommates, Catherine  and Elisabeth . The camera probes the young actors in a series of vérité-style interviews about love, love-making, and politics.Billard, Pierre. Masculine Feminine: a film by Jean-Luc Godard.
