The film depicts the struggles of Rose  to stay employed with the Hillyer family and thus avoid the pitfalls of prostitution. As Rose enters the Hillyer family dwelling as a domestic servant, chaos ensues. Rose has a long history of being sexually abused and confuses overt and promiscuous sex with love. She develops a crush on Mr. Hillyer  that he resists by citing the example of the Spartans' "thou shalt not pass." Meanwhile, Mrs. Hillyer, who is working on her doctoral dissertation, and is a pronounced feminist, becomes Rose's greatest protector. When Rose turns up sick, it is Mrs. Hillyer who protects her interests as Mr. Hillyer and an unscrupulous physician plot to "fix" Rose's problems for good.
