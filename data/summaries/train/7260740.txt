Michele Apicella  is a young mathematics teacher who is called to a supposedly Ã©lite, in fact grotesque, high school with the overblown name of Marilyn Monroe. Michele is characterized by a great number of obsessions and manias ; he also has a habit of spying on the neighbours of his new house, keeping a file for each of them, in which he reports their actions and words.  When one of his neighbours is killed, the police inspector  becomes curious about Apicella's behaviour. Later he meets his colleague Bianca , whom he falls in love with. However, his exceedingly orderly mind and manias for perfection of love prevent him from showing her his true feelings; therefore, their affair starts to suffer. Michele begins to follow her and discovers she may have another lover. Another sub-plot is devoted to Michele's attempts to reconcile his friends Ignazio and Maria. But he fails, and the two are also found killed. Although the police now clearly suspect him, he is rescued by Bianca, who gives Michele a false alibi. However, Michele's equilibrium at this point is completely crumbling. In the final scenes, he himself confess to the inspector that he is the murderer. In a semi-delirious and humorous self-confession , Michele reveals that he felt compelled to kill his neighbours and friends because they had disappointed him, and this disturbs his need for order and steadiness in life.
