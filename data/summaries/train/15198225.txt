The film begins with a pack of wolves howling in the center of Hollywood . Daffy, having travelled to Hollywood, attempts to get into the "Warmer Bros." studio to see movie stars. However, the abrasive Keystone Kops-like security guard with a Joe Besser like voice will not let him pass through the gate. After unsuccessfully endeavoring to enter the studio by way of various disguises and being thrown out each time, culminating with Daffy posing as a film director, but ultimately this disguise is exposed as well. Daffy finally declares that he won't leave until he "sees stars." The guard agrees to show him the stars, then bashes Daffy over the head and throws him out of the studio, where the dazed Daffy can see all the stars he wants...circling his head.
