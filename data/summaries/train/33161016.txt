Donald Duck is on his way to Brownstone National Park to have "fun, fun, fun"! Meanwhile, the park ranger gathers all the bears and assigns them to assist a park visitor; any bear who commits a crime in the park will suffer "the supreme penalty". When all the bears pick their visitor, Humphrey is stuck with Donald. At first, he makes an attempt to earn Donald's food by dancing to no avail. He earns little of Donald's attention when helping him set up his picnic and assorting his sandwiches for him, but goes unrewarded when it seems so. Humphrey finally tries to steal some of Donald's food, mistakingly swallowing a hot pepper and cools down by drinking an entire waterfall. Donald then leaves the park without having Humphrey eating any of his food, so Humphrey follows Donald out onto the road, draws a tire mark on himself and makes Donald believe he ran him over. Donald gives Humphrey his food, but soon realizes he was tricked. Donald then calls for the ranger, and they both fight over the food. They eventually drop everything on the road, and are both put to rubbish work by the ranger. The ranger makes an attempt to steal the ham, but gets caught out by Donald and Humphrey.
