Maliq Ali  is a defense attorney whose guilt over freeing guilty criminals, and the death of his family, leads him to become a costumed ninja vigilante who stalks these same criminals at night. After refusing to defend Tony Fanelli , a small-time mobster accused of murder, he finds himself involved in protecting the only witness, Tracey Allen , from Fanelli's hired thugs. While protecting this young woman, he is confronted by The Red Ninja , a Japanese assassin, who years before killed his family rather than pay Ali for defending him.
