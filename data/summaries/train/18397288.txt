A shipment of gold bullion is stolen by three men in Arizona and buried near Waterhole No. 3. One of them is killed by Lewton Cole, who discovers a map to the buried treasure scrawled on a $20 bill. The other two thieves, Army Sgt. Henry Foggers and his accomplice Hilb, set out to find Cole and the gold. Cole, meanwhile, gets a headstart on the local law enforcement after the killing by locking up Sheriff John Copperud and his deputy in their own jail. Cole rides to the sheriff's ranch, steals his horse and forces himself on Billie, the sheriff's daughter. Copperud returns to the ranch and infuriates Billie by being more upset over losing his horse than about Cole's treatment of her. An honest man is hard to find in these parts, except for a U.S. Cavalry captain named Shipley. It all ends with a long, wild gunfight as Cole and the outlaws go for the gold.
