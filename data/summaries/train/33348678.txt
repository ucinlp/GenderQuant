Ambrose, a kitten, dreams of running away to become a robber. Calling himself "Butch", at the beginning of the cartoon he is seen playâ€“acting a stagecoach robbery, which is interrupted by his mother calling for him to take a bath. Not wanting to take a bath, he decides to run away and become a robber, first stealing a bag of cookies. His first target turns out to be an actual robber: Dirty Bill, a dog. Dirty Bill asks Ambrose if he had pulled off any robberies lately, and Ambrose tells him "just this morning I held up a stagecoach." Dirty Bill asks Ambrose where his loot is, so Ambrose shows Dirty Bill the bag of cookies. Imagining the bag to be full of gold, Dirty Bill demands the bag and threatens Ambrose. Scared, Ambrose runs home and jumps in his bath, acting as though nothing happened.
