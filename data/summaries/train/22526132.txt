When Jack Mitchell, a lonely, middle-aged salesman from Utica, New York, meets his old fraternity brother Larry Moore while on business in Chicago, he asks him to introduce him to a nice woman. Larry gives him T.R. Baskin's phone number, and Jack invites her to visit him at his hotel. Following an awkward silence, the two end up in bed, where T.R. begins to tell Jack about her past, a story that unfolds via flashback. After moving to Chicago from a small town in Ohio, T.R. is forced to rent a studio apartment in a dilapidated building in a run-down area of the city. She finds employment as a typist in a large corporation where she meets Dayle Wigoda, who arranges a blind date with her boyfriend's wealthy friend Arthur, who proves to be an obnoxious bigot and misogynist. T.R. realizes she'd rather be alone than spend time with such a callous individual. One night, after leaving a noisy bar, T.R. sees Larry reading a book at the window of a caf√©. She joins him at his table and learns he edits and publishes textbooks. The two go to his apartment and discuss their individual disappointments. Larry misses spending time with his children, while T.R. confesses she always has felt like an outsider. The two make love, and the following morning T.R. feels she finally has taken the first step towards an intimate relationship, only to discover Larry has put a $20 bill in her coat pocket. Feeling betrayed and humiliated, she rushes out. At home, T.R. calls her parents for consolation but instead receives a lecture about her decision to move to Chicago. Back in the present once again, T.R. and Jack agree they're glad they met each other, and T.R. leaves the hotel, optimistically believing better days are in her future.
