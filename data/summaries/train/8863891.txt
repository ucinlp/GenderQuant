When the Wind Blows depicts a nuclear attack on the UK by the Soviet Union from the viewpoint of a retired couple, James and Hilda Bloggs. The Bloggs live in rural Sussex and are confused regarding the nature and seriousness of their situation, but nonetheless remain optimistic and supportive of each other throughout the crisis. This confusion is sometimes used to generate gentle comedy as well as darker elements. As the film progresses, things become steadily more hopeless as the couple suffer from the effects of radiation sickness. The film ends on an extremely bleak but hopeful note, with their praying together in their fallout shelter as death approaches. At the very end of the closing credits, a Morse code can be heard being tapped, spelling "MAD" for mutual assured destruction.
