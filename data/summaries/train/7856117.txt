After three men are discovered hideously mutilated  and strung up among New York City's high-tension wires, Detective Klaski  stumbles upon a link: Each of the men knew entomologist Remy , a teacher at an inner-city high school. Klaski considers Remy to be a prime, albeit unlikely, suspect in the killings until he witnesses for himself the shape-shifting creature that has been stalking Remy: an intelligent mutant insect with the face of its previous victim. It wants to mate with Remy. Klaski, Remy and a pair of her students get trapped inside the school as the creature hunts them down. Meanwhile, a special forces unit, headed by the militant leader known only as Darksuit , gets ready to fumigate the school with poisonous gas. After all the trapped humans seem to have escaped the fumigation, and with the aid of a heroic Klaski in Remy's case, inspection teams following through find the creature's recently vacated husk and, later on, the mangled corpse of Klaski. It appears that the creature, impersonating Klaski, has been caring for Remy's well-being with a mind to fulfill its base purpose. Unfortunately for it, when they finally meet in a suspenseful setting in Remy's apartment, she decapitates it. However, it is not dead as cockroaches can live up to two weeks without a head and Remy and one of the students, who is now living with her, are left wondering how to handle the situation.
