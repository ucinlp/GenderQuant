Woody and Buzz Buzzard seek the attention of a curvacious Balinese woman named Babalu who wants to sacrifice them to the angry volcano god of her island, who is in need of long pig for his dinner instead of his usual vegetables. So the sexy seductress performs an alluring dance to get the two sailors to follow her. At one point Buzz accidentally winds up in the arms of a female gorilla who thinks he is handsome. Neither Woody nor Buzz end up with the beautiful Babalu, but they do escape from the volcano's wrath with their lives.
