Terry  is having an affair with his boss' wife Sylvia . One night after an office party, they are together and Sylvia witnesses an attack on Denise  from Terry's bedroom window. She doesn't want to expose their relationship and so is reluctant about talking to the police. Terry, wanting to help, gives the police the description of the attacker. He soon becomes the main prosecution witness until it becomes clear he cannot have witnessed the assault, at which point he becomes the main suspect in the case. He then sets out to find the real rapist/killer with some help from Denise.
