Morocco has spent more than 30 years denying the Saharans the right to their own life and land. In exile, the women are the pillar of their struggle; they keep the society together and keep up the fight and resistance. Their struggle, from abroad, from refugee camps, from their occupied land, shows the strength and force of the Saharan women. The "Tebraa" is the Saharan women’s song, be it of love or sorrow, and they sing when they are alone. It’s an intimate song. That’s where we have tried to go, to that place that no army can take away, that place full of pain and hope, of weariness and love, of struggle and desire.
