Old hacendado don Ambrosio awaits the return of his son Rafael after ten years of studying medicine in the U.S. Although illiterate, Ambrosio is taught reading and writing by his orphaned goddaughter Lupe. When Rafael arrives, he seems to forget to be mexicano  and is ashamed of his Mexican roots as he refuses to be served "mole" and rather asks for ham and eggs. He is suddenly attracted by Lupe, his father's goddaughter and seduces her. Ambrosio learned that she is pregnant, unbeknownst to Rafael. When Rafael plans to marry Sarita, a high-class lady, Ambrosio and Lupe head to Mexico City to reveal the truth and to prevent Rafael from marrying. He is eventually not married, but Fabi√°n  is in love with Lupe and is willing to marry her even though the child is Rafael. In the end, Rafael recuperates his Mexicaness and then proposes marriage to Lupe, and Ambrosio rests at last.
