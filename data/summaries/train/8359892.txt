The basic plot involves people who are captured by Big-foot. There is a group of hunters trying to hunt down big foot, bumbling at first, but in terms of rescuing the captured women, and capturing the gigantic 'King of the Woods' alive for public exhibition for profit victorious  in the end. It also involves "cool" college students riding cheap imported motorcycles to rescue the captured young women. In the middle of the film, the skeptical sheriff's department and the ranger's station are notified of the women's disappearance, but to no avail on the part of the authorities with respect to actually searching for the missing women. The unlikely heroes in the very end are a hardy, gun-toting old mountain man who had previously lost one of his arms during a historical encounter  with the gigantic, erect animal and one of the idiotic dynamite-armed bike riders. The old man hero's wife, an Indian squaw, prophesies "bad medicine"  just before the final man-vs.-Bigfoot showdown. Note: some or all of the outdoor scenes may have been shot near Red Bluff in Northern California because the lady  piloting the junky-looking airplane calls "Red Bluff Radio" during the distress transmission. Tehama County, CA is mountainous wilderness where some Sasquatch sightings have been known to have occurred.
