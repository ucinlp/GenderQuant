{{Plot}} The trafficking of young women as sex slaves has reached epidemic proportions and the criminals aren't even getting caught. With the wealthy and powerful calling the shots, the chief of police says there's nothing that can be done. Even when one of his own officers, Yuka, is kidnapped during an attempted sting operation and sold into slavery herself. Now it's up to her fellow officers, Maki and Reimi, to break all the rules, steal weapons and armor from their own department, and get Yuka back themselves. They can only hope that they won't get to her before it's too late, and that they'll escape the rescue with their jobs...and their lives
