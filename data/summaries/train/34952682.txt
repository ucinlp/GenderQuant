Havet is a Tunisian woman of some forty years. She is a widow and has a twenty-year-old son who has immigrated to Canada. She lives with her mother in a working-class neighborhood in Tunis and works as a telemarketing operator for a French company installed in Tunis. Each morning, she leaves for work, sinking deeper and deeper into suffocating routine. At home, her life is monotonous and of no interest.
