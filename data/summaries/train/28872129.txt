Set in a school called Devon, it follows the friendships of two young teens, Finn and Gene. Both of them share both good times and bad times as they attempt to go thru the teen process towards adulthood, along with studying in school: they also consider being drafted, if that should come. The film is set in 1943, during World War II, and is told by an older Gene. The film was shot at the Philip Exeter Academy, where the real John Knowles went to school.
