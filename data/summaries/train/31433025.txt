Arsalan younger brother, a finance executive with a Pakistani textile conglomerate is killed in a drive by shooting. The word on the street is that it was a hit arranged by religious extremists as revenge for being swindled by Hamza as he ran their money laundering operations . Arsalan has abandoned his family for 12 years, he even stayed away when his mother died, but now he decides to go back to find the truth about his brother’s death. Arsalan Mirza is a man who can’t escape his past and is drawn back to it. He knows that if he returns to Karachi, he will pay for the sins of his past. Still he finds himself compelled and in that way he is driven to commit a violent act of retribution. Kala Pul uses the thriller genre as the driving force to provide insight on Karachi; a forgotten megalopolis of fifteen million people in Pakistan, a front line state in the War Against Terror. It unites Mausoof with Salim Iqbal, a veteran Pakistani actor who has been given a new opportunity to probe both the underworld vibes of Karachi and the evolving role of a masculine code of honor. Kala Pul will affect different audiences in different ways. This deceptively simple screenplay is the foundation for an absorbing narrative that lets the audience experience issues and images that are not only topical but also relevant not just to Karachites but to global citizens.
