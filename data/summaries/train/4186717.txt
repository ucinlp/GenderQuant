Love Is All There Is is a modern retelling of the Romeo and Juliet story. It is set in the Bronx during the 1990s. The Cappamezzas , Bronx-born Sicilians, own a local catering business. They develop a bitter rivalry with the pretentious Malacicis , recent immigrants from Florence and owners of a fine Italian restaurant. The Cappamezzas' son, Rosario,  falls in love with the Malacicis' daughter, Gina,  after she replaces the obese star of the neighborhood church's staging of Romeo and Juliet. The rivalry intensifies after Rosario deflowers Gina after a fight with her parents. The movie was filmed at Greentree Country Club in New Rochelle, NY and many scenes were shot in City Island, Bronx, New York.
