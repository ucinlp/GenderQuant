The story begins with a corrupt Member of Parliament  shutting down a country town's main source of employment in the local meatworks. This leaves Wally Norman ([[Kevin Harrington  out of a job, until drunk politician Willy Norman accidentally writes the wrong name on the parliamentary nomination form. Wally is at first apprehensive about running, until he realises it is the only way to save the meatworks. Throughout the film Wally is coached by Willy Norman and assistant Myles Greenstreet  in how to best appeal to the voters, as well as overcome his fear of public speaking. Meanwhile, Myles is attracted to Wally's daughter, and a wombat's career skyrockets. Much of the film's humour comes from wordplay, such as naming the town Givens Head, and the foreman of the meatworks being named George. Shaun Micallef said he had to insist that his own moniker was modified from F. Ken Oath to F. Ken Oats to soften one of the film's less subtle attempts at punning.<ref namehttp://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/11/12/1068329614107.html|titleZion|first13 November 2003|publisher21 November 2010}}
