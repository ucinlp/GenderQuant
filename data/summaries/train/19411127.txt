Opening his own detective agency, Alfalfa dons a deerstalker cap and rechristens himself "X-10, Sooper Sleuth." His first assignment: to find out who stole a box of candy from Darla. Suspecting that Leonard and Junior are the alleged culprits, Alfalfa and his chief  operatives Buckwheat and Porky put a tail on the two youngsters. Unfortunately, the three junior gumshoes are sidetracked to a seaside amusement pier, where they find themselves trapped in a spooky-themed fun-house. Darla eventually discovers her candy was right where she left it- in her doll carriage. But it's too late: scared out of their wits by various ersatz ghosts, monsters and spooky moans and groans, our heroes vow to give up the detective business forever .<ref namehttp://movies.nytimes.com/movie/225693/Hide-and-Shriek/overview |title2008-09-21|work=NY Times}}
