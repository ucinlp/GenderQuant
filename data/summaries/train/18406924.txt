Dayo is a heartwarming story of overcoming one's fear and succeeding over adversity. The plot revolves around Bubuy  who is out to save his abducted grandparents in the land of Elementalia, a magical and mystical world that houses many of the Philippines' mythical creatures and other enchanted elements. This locally produced animated film aims to reintroduce the other side of mythical creatures like the tikbalang, kapre, manananggal, and aswang by giving a new dimension to these typically reviled creatures.
