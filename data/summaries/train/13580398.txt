One day he arrests a man named Pandey, and after questioning him, finds out that the person behind this crime was a man named Guman Singh. He gets on the trail of Guman Singh, arrests him, and keeps him in a cell. Then a series of explosions creat havoc in the city, with the assailants demanding the unconditional release of Guman.

They threaten Jai with dire consequences, forcing Jai to resign from his job. Hoping that he and his family are safe, Jai starts to re-build his life, along with his sweetheart, Sharmila. Then tragedy strikes, his mother is killed in an accident, and his brother is abducted by Jagtap Singh and Guman, who demand that he return a bag containing their valuables.
