 Having read about the U.S. fighting forces pushing the Nazi troops back during World War II , Daffy is in a patriotic mood. However, his mood quickly changes to fear when he gets a call that "the little man from the draft board" wants to see him. Hiding in his house, Daffy looks out, eventually seeing the little man, who attempts to hand him a telegram . Daffy starts crying. Daffy continues to try to outrun the little man, who seems to be everywhere that Daffy happens to be at the moment. Daffy even goes so far as to plant a bomb near the man, finally, Daffy locking him in a safe, bricking the safe up, putting up a wall over the bricks , running to the roof and taking off in a rocket. However, the rocket soon plunges back to earth, causing Daffy to crash-land in Hell . Shrugging off this turn, Daffy spots a demon  and tells him, "Oh well, at least I put one over on that dope from the draft board!" The demon takes off his mask to reveal he's the man from the draft board, who then replies with the popular catchphrase of the "Richard Q. Peavey" character from The Great Gildersleeve, "Well, now, I wouldn't say that,"  and proceeds to chase Daffy into the distance, letter still in hand. Porky Pig ends the cartoon with his famous Looney Tunes drum scene.
