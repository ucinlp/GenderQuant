Although they come from different ethnic groups, these three musicians from Mali come together to make people listen to the desert: Habib Koité, a Bambara whose roots are in the Khassonke culture of western Mali, Afel Bocoum, a Songhai, considered the heir to Ali Farka Touré, and Tartit, an all-female Tuareg group from Timbuktu, ethnically related to the Berber people, that lends its voice to the cause of a subsisting culture. The coming together of these three artists is an event with true political significance considering the tragic events that shook Mali between 1995 and 1996.
