In her hometown of Rabbit Creek, vivacious teenager Lotta Crabtree is thrilled when the famed performer Lola Montez comes to town in 1863. She wants to become a singer like Lola herself someday, although parents Mary Ann and John Crabtree, who run a boarding house, don't necessarily approve. Lotta has a couple of admirers, the local boy Mart Taylor and a mature newcomer to town, Tom Richmond, who is informed that Lotta is only 16. A boarder named Cornelius with a surefire way to win at roulette lures Lotta's dad into a game, where he loses all of his money plus the boarding house. Aware of the way Lola Montez made a fortune singing in mining camps for men who can't get to a theater, Lotta sets out on the road to do likewise. The miners like her, but don't throw gold pieces her way until she strips off part of her costume and gives them quite a show. Tom is apparently a professional gambler and wins a San Francisco theater in a card game. Lotta becomes a star there, then travels East to perform in New York. Older and wiser in two years, she learns that Tom has been committing robberies to raise money for the Confederate army in the Civil War, which she appreciates, being a Southern girl. The war ends but she sings "Dixie" on stage in New York, to catcalls from the audience. Lotta appeases them by saying the victors should be generous to those who have lost. Tom has been reported near death from an injury, but at that very minute, he enters the theater to Lotta's delight.
