Dress shop owner Joe Bates  is a happily married man who dreads Friday the 13th. Fearing the worst, Joe decides not to go to work to avoid any catastrophes, but his wife  simply dismisses it and tells him that he is being superstitious. Joe agrees with her and decides to start preparing breakfast, but things quickly go wrong. Food begins to fly everywhere, dishes fall and break all over the place and a bowl of waffle batter drapes all over Joe. When his wife returns to the kitchen, she tells him that yesterday was Friday the 13th and to start getting ready for work. Later at the dress shop, Joe mistakes a female customer  for a mannequin. When her jealous husband  goes over to find out what is going on, a nervous Joe tells him that it was a misunderstanding. Another problem occurs shortly after when the same female customer and another one  get into a scuffle involving a hat they both want to purchase. Joe tries to break up the fight, but ends up getting knocked to the floor along with the first customer. Joe's wife and the jealous husband show up and Joe's wife, thinking that he is cheating on him runs off and Joe gets punched out by the jealous husband. Joe eventually tracks down his wife at the Amazon hotel, which is a hotel for women only. The concierge  tells Joe that she was given orders by his wife that she does not want to be disturbed, but Joe manages to disguise himself as a woman to find the room his wife is. He winds up in the same room with the female customer he met earlier at the shop. He also has to dodge the jealous husband and a female house detective, before finally reuniting with his wife at the end.
