An injured Sgt. Lance Rainier wakes up to the warning notices of his critically damaged Red Lion losing life-support systems as a result of an "accident". He is unable to contact his teammates, and his onboard computer presumes that the other lions were destroyed in the accident. With less than 10 minutes of oxygen left in the cockpit, Lance risks his remaining energy to record a message to the Galaxy Alliance, warning them Voltron has failed, King Zarkon has won, and they must prepare for the inevitable. He ends his message by saying, "Someday, somehow, Voltron will rise again to become the defender that this great universe deserves. Until that day, Godspeed. Good Luck. Red Lion, out." The computer bids him farewell after sending the message.
