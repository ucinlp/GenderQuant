Harvey Bellinger , his wife Lydia , and their two teenage kids live a well-to-do life in suburbia. This changes, however, when their seventeen year old son puts video cameras around their house, and starts to broadcast the family's actions live on the internet. When Harvey finds about this, he is angry and appalled. But when he realizes that money can be made with the internet broadcasts, the Bellingers start acting crazier, eventually leading to Harvey blowing up the house to get rid of the cameras.
