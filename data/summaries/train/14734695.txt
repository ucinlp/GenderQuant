The Stooges reminisce about their wartime romances in Europe. After they finish their tales, they discover that Joe's girl Fifi , whom he left behind in Paris, has moved in next door. The only problem is that she is now married to a very jealous and unappreciative husband .Typical Stooge antics result in ruining Fifi's dress, and dressing her in a pair of pajamas is an invitation for her husband to enter the scene. The husband turns out to be a real cad, and when Fifi overhears him tell about his plans to find a new wife, she clobbers him and goes back to Joe.
