Joe Don Baker plays Texas "lawman" Thomas Jefferson Geronimo III, a beefy sheriff and avid milk drinker. His partner, the former sheriff, is killed by an Italian mobster. He finds the criminal, a man named Joseph Palermo, and escorts him back to Europe, only to lose him in the capital city of Valletta in Malta. He then thumbs his nose at local law enforcement and uses all the tactics of Texas justice to pursue Palermo. A cat-and-mouse game follows, rife with car chases, gunfights, fistfights and boat chases.  The film was featured in the eighth episode of MST3Ks tenth and final season. It is the second Joe Don Baker film to be riffed on MST3K, following Mitchell, to which a few references were made in this episode. Including the end of the episode, when show host Mike falsely believes it is his turn to leave after viewing Final Justice. This is in reference to the show's previous host, Joel, leaving the series at the end of viewing Mitchell. The version of the film used in the MST3K episode also contains a very prominent editing mistake. Early in the film when the sheriff  dies, there is a shot of the partner getting killed and collapsing to the ground. Moments later, the exact shot is repeated. This error only appears in a TV print. The original Vestron release does not contain this mistake. One host segment in the MST3K episode makes reference to the editing mistake by having host Mike Nelson trip over and over again. Another reference to Final Justice is made in a host segment in the next episode, using Geronimo's catch phrase from the film: "You think you can take me? Go ahead on. It's your move."
