A wealthy couple have a child that is born without both legs. To shelter his wife from the pain of knowing that their only child had been born crippled, he convinces their maid to trade the child she is expecting with his. She agrees and out of greed and bitterness she sells the child to the circus. The circus becomes the childâ€™s home where he grows up being exploited and exhibited as a human freak.http://sinaescribe.blogspot.com/2008/10/los-que-no-deben-nacer.html/
