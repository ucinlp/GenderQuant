This is the story of a native boy in Africa. The story of one of my brothers. His name, Jim Jabulani Twala. But we will simply call him Jim. This is the country where he was born and grew to manhood. Where he lived in the freedom of the wide hills and valleys, tending the crops, herding the cattle. It was a simple life, and a good life. And Jim was happy. But, to many of us, there comes a time when we feel the urge to leave our villages and to travel to the cities. Often the young men go for a year, sometimes two years. Or even more, so that they may earn money and then return to their people and buy cattle and marry. Sometimes it is just a spirit of restlessness and adventure that sends them travelling.
