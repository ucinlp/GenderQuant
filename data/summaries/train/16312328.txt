When the body of a young woman is found on an isolated beach, Lieutenant Phil Gaines and his partner, Sergeant Louis Belgrave, are the weary and bitter LAPD detectives assigned to the homicide investigation. They conclude, with the support of the coroner's report, that the victim, a hooker and known drug user named Gloria Hollinger, committed suicide using pills. The commanding officer, Santuro, tells them to close the case. When the detectives talk to the family about the death they omit two facts about the case. That just prior to her death Gloria attended a party at the home of Leo Sellers, a rich, powerful, but corrupt, local attorney and that Gloria had large quantities of semen in her stomach, vagina and rectum indicating that she had apparently engaged in a variety of sexual acts with numerous partners just prior to her demise. Her father, Marty Hollinger, a headstrong veteran of the Korean Conflict, does not accept the official report and attempts to locate the possible criminal involvement with his own investigation. He discovers the connection to Sellers, who is also a regular costumer of Phil's girlfriend, the French prostitute Nicole Britton.
