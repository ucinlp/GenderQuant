The story is set in the middle class home of Madhavan , a budding lawyer, who works for Visu. His retired and irresponsible father Delhi Ganesh is more interested in playing cards than looking for grooms for his two unmarried daughters. Circumstances force Madhavan to marry Abhirami , even before his sisters are wed, a situation quite unthinkable in middle class homes. Meanwhile Madhavan's sisters find their match in auto driver Vadivelu, and an unemployed Vivek who claims to have a royal background. Then he conducts the weddings of both his but in the struggle to keep the rest of his family happy, he and Abirami are unable to enjoy even the basic pleasures of married life. The film tackles a single issue - that of Prabhu and Abirami, a married couple, being unable to consummate their marriage. Initial potential issues such as the problems with getting the sisters married are quickly abandoned and the movie turns into a series of mostly comic sketches about interruptions to the plans of Prabhu and Abirami to conduct their first night. }
