Taipei Story concerns a young woman ([[Tsai_Chin_ urgently seeking to navigate the maze of contemporary Taipei, and find a future. She hopes that her boyfriend Lung  is the key to the future, but Lung is stuck in a past that combines baseball and traditional loyalty that leads him to squander his nest egg bailing her father out of financial trouble. The film "displays Yang's uncompromising critique of the middle-class with its dissection of its heroine's emotional fragility, vainly disguised behind the sunglasses she sports day and night. As she flees the past, her boyfriend idealistically clings to it, a Confucian rigidity toward which Yang bears still less patience."{{citation}}
