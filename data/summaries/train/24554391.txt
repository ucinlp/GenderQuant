In Samba On Your Feet  the filmmakers go behind the Carioca milieu to document samba and carnival. The one-hour documentary traces the influences that contributed to shape the music that consecrated Carnival as one of the most powerful cultural manifestations in Brazil. Roots and perspectives, flesh and ghosts, entities and divinities spread across the slums and over the sidewalks of Salvador, Bahia and Rio de Janeiro are essential to the make-up of the Brazilian musical exponent par excellence. Samba On Your Feet introduces the voices of Cartola, Caetano Veloso, Ismael Silva, Clara Nunes, Clementina and many others whose perspectives on the cultural affairs of Rio de Janeiro that have been carefully articulated with interviews to exponents of the Brazilian culture today. This dialogue between past and present takes place throughout the movie between precious scenes of archive footage from private collection, and government resources. Samba On Your Feet was mostly shot in the marginal slums, in the umbanda terreiros, in the favelas where the less fortunate inhabitants of Rio strive to overcome overwhelming rates crime and illiteracy to the rhythm and soul of the music they call samba.Filmmakers LibraryJanela Cultural.
