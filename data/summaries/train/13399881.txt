A wealthy couple leave their young child with a nanny while they attend a social event. While under the care of the nanny, the child wanders off into the yard and strolls down to the beach with her doll and gets into a boat. The boat drifts away out to sea and the girl is rescued by nearby fishermen who take her to their humble shack. Meanwhile, the nanny who was reading a book realizes the child’s disappearance and alerts the parents. When the parents arrive they find only the child’s bonnet and the doll’s stroller near the beach and assume the child had drowned.
