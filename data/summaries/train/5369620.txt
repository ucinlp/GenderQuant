The movie has whatever a Hindi movie of 1970s needed to have - good and glamorous actors, good locations and songs, a totally corrupt villain, a suffering woman, some thrill and a happy ending. Although the movie is a good entertainer, The story is really good and main theme is well scripted but due to poor editing could not make its required impact over viewers.
