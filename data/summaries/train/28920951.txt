Gunnery Sergeant Jim Moore, a Drill Instructor on Parris Island, has a thorn in his side, Private Owens , who always caves in when the pressure's on. Convinced he can make Owens into Marine material, Moore pushes Owens to the point of desertion. Barrett's screenplay expanded the play by introducing subplots of Moore having a romance with a local shop girl  and having Owens' mother  make a trip to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot to beg the Corps to keep her son in to make a man out of him.
