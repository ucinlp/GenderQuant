The film starts with colorful 1960s music by composer Anton Abril, accompanied by Marcello Giombini’s wordless song Seli  and some psychedelic opening credits. The opening scene is some poorly duplicated stock footage of rockets blasting off and low budget special effects. In the movie, Thora, the Arkonide expedition’s commander is a platinum blonde with a wardrobe of skintight spacesuits. The film adds an intriguing subplot about a super criminal that doesn’t appear in the novel. The evil ‘Homer Larkin’ plots to get the Moon's wealth before Terra’s governments take it all for themselves. Mr. Larkin has a pet similar to the running gag in James Bond movies.
