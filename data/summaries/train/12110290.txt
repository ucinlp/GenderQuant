The Peace Tree tells the story of two little girls, one Muslim and one Christian, who dream of celebrating each otherâ€™s festivals, Christmas and Eid. But when they share their dreams, they are met with resistance from their parents who express their concerns. Through their struggles, they create a unique symbol -- The Peace Tree, a tree that highlights the symbols from all our cultures and faiths to reflect the beauty of "diversity in unity". The Peace Tree shares the voices of the children who try to enlighten their parents to the importance of sharing and celebrating diversity together. The Peace Tree has been invited to over 50 film festivals including Tribeca Film Festival and received twelve international awards.
