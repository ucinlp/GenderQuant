A small group of members of the Red Brigades rent an apartment. They kidnap Aldo Moro, former prime minister of Italy and leader of the Democrazia Cristiana  party. Moro writes many letters to politicians, Pope Paul VI, and his family, but the Italian government refuses to negotiate. A female member of the group, played by Maya Sansa, suffers doubts about the plan. Bellocchio had already directed a documentary, in 1995, about the Red Brigades and the kidnapping of Aldo Moro. It was entitled Sogni infranti . The soundtrack makes heavy use of Pink Floyd music: the song "Shine on You Crazy Diamond" plays during the final sequence and its riff plays on prominently during the course of the film. "The Great Gig In The Sky" also features in one sequence.
