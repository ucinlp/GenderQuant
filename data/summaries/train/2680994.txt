The sequel picks up on Christmas Eve some years after the first one, with Ricky Caldwell, the 18-year-old brother of the first film's killer, being held in a mental hospital, awaiting trial for a series of murders he committed. While being interviewed by psychiatrist Dr. Henry Bloom, Ricky tells the story of the murders his brother Billy committed through a series of several flashbacks that use footage from the original film, as well as some new shots inserted in the flashbacks to make Ricky appear in more of Billy's original story. After this is done, Ricky tells his own story: after Billy's death, he was adopted and given a good upbringing, but his trauma was never treated. After his foster father's death, Ricky seems to lose composure and commits a series of random murders, targeting people who are "naughty". A chance for a happy and normal life seems to materialize when he starts dating Jennifer Statson. However, an unpleasant encounter with Jennifer's ex-boyfriend Chip sends Ricky over the edge. He kills Chip by electrocuting him with jumper cables attached to a red car in front of Jennifer. He then uses the antenna of the car to strangle Jennifer to death. An officer sees this and as Ricky is about to get arrested, he grabs the officer's gun, shoots the officer in the head, and then goes on a shooting spree through a suburban neighborhood before being captured by the police. Cutting back to the present day, Ricky kills Dr. Bloom and escapes from the mental hospital, murdering a Salvation Army Santa before stealing the man's costume. Ricky's plan is to kill the now disfigured, wheelchair-using Mother Superior, whom he blames for Billy's death. After a chase through her house, he succeeds in decapitating Mother Superior. The cops arrive and gun Ricky down. Sister Mary wakes up, sees Mother Superior's decapitated head and screams. Ricky, who was shot down, opens his eyes and smiles evilly, indicating that he survived.
