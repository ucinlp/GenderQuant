Movin' In is a comedy about a young man from Switzerland who travels to Los Angeles to escape his dead-end life and to reconnect with a female pen pal with whom he has lost touch. Everything falls apart when the pen pal turns out to be a complete fraud and he is reunited with an old friend  who keeps pulling him into the most awkward situations. The story takes unexpected turns when the two - somewhere between moving into an old folks home, going to auditions, and dealing with a phony agent and a group of gangsters - fall for the same girl.http://www.movininmovie.com/synopsis.php
