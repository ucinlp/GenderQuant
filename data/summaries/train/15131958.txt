The sheriff of this small island town called North Port has a roach problem in his house. According to the local exterminator Homer , it turns out the whole town is about to have a big roach problem. Pets, and then people, begin to disappear. Although Sheriff Richard Tarbell  is dating Lillian, the owner of the local eatery, his high school sweetheart Elizabeth Johnson returns to the island after a four-year absence and their romance blooms again. Elizabeth  happens to be the daughter of the town's mayor, Elias Johnson , who is in cahoots with an evil corporation called INTEC that has been secretly breeding mutant roaches that are immune to normal insect repellants. They also seem to have the ability to assume the form of anything they kill, leading to some animal/roach hybrids and even a roach/human combo.
