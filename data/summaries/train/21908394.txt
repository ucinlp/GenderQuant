Alice McGrath is a woman struggling with her busy life. On a similar vein to Michael Keaton in Multiplicity, she splits into three different versions of herself, making four Alices living one multi-faceted life. One Alice is a devoted mother and homemaker, another is a loving and "exciting" wife and lover, and the third is a committed green activist/businesswoman. While the new Alices do all that needs to be done, the real Alice finally gets to relax from her busy schedule. It soon becomes clear that the family can only see the three new Alices while the real Alice is invisible to all of them. Although she enjoys having more time to herself, she misses out on contact with her children and is unimpressed when the loving wife gets intimate with her husband Rex. As the movie progresses, it becomes evident to Alice what is lacking in her life and how she can improve it. She just has to work out how to get back to being herself and get rid of the other three. In the end, she manages to balance her busy schedule and spend time with her family.
