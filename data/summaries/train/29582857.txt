It is the year of 1865 and the LÃ¶wencreutz family are expecting a very prominent visitor, King Charles XV is coming to stay. However Carl Henrik von Grimm reads a telegram stating that the King is in fact cancelling his visit. At the theatre that night Grimm notices the actor Leonard Petterson who happens to resemble the king a great deal. This gives Grimm an idea that could work in his favor. Can he hire the actor to play the King and get away with it?
