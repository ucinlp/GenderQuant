Farley, an advertising copy writer for the fictional Finster Cigarette Company, is dismayed by the medical establishment's successful campaign to link smoking with lung cancer. It dawns on Farley that one effective way to counter this campaign would be to promote the concept of being "too tough to care" about the hazards of smoking. So he launches an advertising campaign, complete with a compelling jingle, showing men such as dynamite workers and gas workers lighting up Finster cigarettes in situations that would be dangerous, suggesting that they are too tough to care about consequences. The campaign is successful. Farley offers other executives a Finster cigarette to celebrate, but the offer is declined. Farley is the only one who smokes.
