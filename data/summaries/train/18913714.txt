The movie starts with Justin  and Seann  taking two girls into their apartment. As they are about to go in, the key doesn't fit. And suddenly the Keymaker  shows up and realises they are the ones. He opens the door with the key around his neck. He opens the door and when Justin and Seann enter the door, they are transported to Zion, where  a party is held at the temple. They learn from an extremely flamboyant dancer  that Zion is the last human city and the robots are coming to kill them. They also learn that Morpheus is having a huge orgy at his place with machines. Justin refuses, but when Seann tries to stay he's pulled by his ear out. They come through a door and they see that Seann has a really kinky suit made of leather. Seann runs through a door marked 'Men' and Justin goes through another door into a park. He sees Neo talking to the Oracle . After a discussion about N'Sync and the robot, Stiffler comes. He sticks his hand into and transforms her into a clone of him. And just then an army of Stiffler clones comes out and fights Justin as a parody of the "Burly Brawl" scene. In place of the "Burly Brawl" music during the fight scene with the clones, this parody uses the song "Rock Your Body". He finally defeats Stiffler by punching him and turning him back into Seann. They get into an argument and are transported to the Architect's TV Room. The Architect  addresses about the connection between the Matrix and the MTV Movie awards and how he has no idea what he's talking about. He also talks about how Neo was supposed to host the Awards but since it was a full-time job and he was a bit distracted . He gets into an argument with Neo and yells at him. He shows them two doors, one door leads to the MTV Awards and the other leads to Trinity. Justin and Seann leave through one door and when Neo is about to leave through the other, the Architect jumps on him and they both smash through the door.
