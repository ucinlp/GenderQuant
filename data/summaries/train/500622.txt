The film is about the coming of age of two sisters and their friend through the romantic lives of the three main characters: Kat Araujo , Daisy Araujo , and Jojo Barbosa , who are waitresses at Mystic Pizza in Mystic, Connecticut. In the film, Mystic is represented as a fishing town with a large Portuguese American population. The film also touches on an Old World work ethic. Kat and Daisy are sisters and rivals: Kat studies astronomy, works at a local planetarium, as well as the restaurant, and has been accepted to attend Yale University on a partial scholarship. Daisy just wants to find love through lust while trying to get out of Mystic. Kat is the apple of her Portuguese mother's eye, while Daisy is not: she is promiscuous and is not as goal-oriented as her younger sister. There is also a dynamic between Kat's Anglo-American employer, a father who has hired her to look after his young daughter while his wife is away, and the resulting relationship between them. The class distinctions and variant European heritages are explored in various scenes of the film.
