In late 1944, the Hongerwinter famine is starting to bite in the occupied northern and western Netherlands and Nazi persecution is rife. The farm of Jan Alting , a Dutch patriot who has disowned his son for his collaboration with the occupying German forces, is known by the Dutch Resistance as a place of refuge for those who are in danger from the Germans. With the help of his daughter Elly , Alting is currently providing shelter for Jewish couple Mark and Mary Meyer ([[Martin Benson ; van Nespen , an aristocrat with active links to the underground movement, and Bakker , a Communist wanted by the Germans for sabotage. All are aware of the constant risk of betrayal and exposure. Jan's son Anton  returns unexpectedly to his former home, and discovers that his father and sister are harbouring subversives. He orders his father to turn them out immediately, threatening to shoot them all if this is not done. Jan is faced with the seemingly irreconcilable demands of patriotism and responsibility for the safety of his shelterers, set against the feelings he still has for Anton, despite the latter's betrayal of all Jan stands for. He faces the stark moral choice of failing those to whom he has given refuge, or conspiring with them to kill his own son.
