Ralph Crumden and Ned Morton go out for a walk from Ned's house to Ralph's house. Ned stops to lasso a cat, but when Ralph grabs the cord, he gets dragged in and pounded by the cat. The cat enters the house next to Ralph's house, finding a chance to grab the mice. The cat puts his mouth against the mousehole so that Ralph and Ned enter the cats body. Ralph lights a match in the darkness making smoke and the cat regurgitates the mice. The mice walk on thinking they entered the wrong place. The cat goes into Ralph's house through a grate. Ralph and Ned cautiously enter the house thinking their wives are sleeping sound. Ralph greets "Alice" and grabs her new fur coat, ripping a piece of fur of the cat. In response the cat slices Ralph. Ned tries to talk with "Trixie", but the cat massacres Ned. Both mice march in to confront their "wives", but the cat beats them up and the two mice go to sleep at park to get away from their "aggressive wives". Alice and Trixie return from the movies to Ralph's house cautiously entering, but the cat beats them up as well. Both ladies go to sleep at park to get away from their "aggressive husbands". Unknown to them their husbands are asleep on the other side of the same bench.
