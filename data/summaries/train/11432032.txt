Former police officer and luckless private investigator Simon Brenner has become an emergency medical technician, having been fired from the police force because he slept with his boss's wife. He only wants to keep out of trouble and keep a steady job for a while, but finds himself caught up in a war between two rival EMS organizations. Brenner is dragged back into his old detective life when a well-known nurse falls victim to a double murder in a hospital. The weary Brenner does not care, but his young and idealistic EMS partner Berti is eager to investigate. Soon after this another murder occurs â€” this time a fellow paramedic is the victim. Brenner finally realizes that he has to solve this case, if only to return to his quiet and blissfully uneventful life of late. Slowly but stubbornly plodding along, he uncovers the ugly truth as he is confronted with the bitter war between rival ambulance companies.
