Charlie eventually spots a restaurant owner opening his shop and makes himself at home  before being kicked out of the restaurant. As he goes back, he sees the owner has gone out for 15 minutes  and decides to run the restaurant himself. Charlie first enrages the one customer who comes in, then after feeding him spaghetti from a long line of spaghetti serves grape juice he presses with his feet in front of the customer, causing the customer to rush out. When the shop owner comes back, Charlie tries to convince the owner that they need a 'floor show' . The owner finally appears to relent, and starts walking Charlie home when he yells that the Tower of Pisa is "about to fall on that little house!" The owner then has Charlie hold up the tower while he 'calls for help' . Charlie is left 'holding up' the tower, calling out for help and asking "Doesn't anyone around here capice?"
