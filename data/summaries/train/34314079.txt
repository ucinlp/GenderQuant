The story is about an alien experiment on 4 guys camping. The film's script had a plot in which the viewer did not know what would happen next, as odd events occurred quite often. This is because its script displayed a series of tests with no logical progression or reward mechanism. Also the characters are unaware of the agenda and overall plan.
