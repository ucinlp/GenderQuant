In Time of Favor Manachem, a handsome, stoic soldier in the Israeli Defense Force, is offered his own unit, made up of fellow students from Rabbi Meltzer’s West Bank Yeshiva. At the same time, Rabbi Meltzer plays matchmaker with his daughter, Michal, and star student Pini. It’s no surprise that Michal, strong-willed and independent, prefers Manachem’s silent strength to Pini’s over excitement. The love triangle knots up and the political tension raises throughout the film until everyone’s allegiances are tested in the end. “This land of Israel is bought with pain,” says Michal, the Rabbi’s pale and skinny much desired daughter, as she looks out on the sandy mountains of the West Bank. Romantic love and patriotic love are both full of pain in Cedar's film. Set in Israel, Time of Favor moves from the country's barren desert to a secret underground tunnel system. The characters bathe in underground pools, run through 1800 year-old catacombs, and pray on large spreads of earth, where the barren nature impresses a sense of solemnity. Cedar’s Zionist upbringing is apparent in this highly religious film. Time of Favor handles the Holy Land with high regard and maintains a sense of solemnity throughout. The importance of prayer and tradition is stressed. Soldiers dressed in full uniform break from their training to open prayer books and raise their minds to God. The Rabbi’s religious position marks him as a strong authority in his community. He is trusted and respected, and his students, with total faith in him, follow his every wish.
