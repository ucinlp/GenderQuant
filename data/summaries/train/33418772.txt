The movie begins with a scientist, Tevis Shapiro , working on a treatment for HIV/AIDS using vampires as test subjects who, in the process, accidentally discovers a serum that would allow vampires to exist in the daylight. This causes a clash between vampire clans; those who would resist its use in favor of tradition and those who are eager to use the serum for freedom to live in the light and to permanently defeat humans, most specifically vicious vampire Borlak . When Shapiro goes missing, Borlak kills the man's wife and threatens his daughter Jenny , who is rescued by her new love, young vampire Billy  whom she has coincidentally just met in a local nightclub. Borlak is then joined by Billy's ex-girlfriend Lisa  who is hoping to sabotage Billy's new relationship. Billy joins forces with police officer and vampire hunter Joe Kau  to defeat Borlak and destroy the serum, but not before Jenny is killed during their final confrontation. In the end, Billy allows Kau to kill him as well in order to reunite with his lost love.
