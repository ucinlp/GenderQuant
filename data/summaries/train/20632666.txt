The Pink Panther is strolling the streets of Italy when he spots The Little Man who plays Leonardo da Vinci painting what appears to be his newest masterpiece, the Mona Lisa. Da Vinci paints a grumpy mouth on the Mona Lisa, but the Pink Panther decides to covertly replace the frown with a teeth-filled smile. When the smile wins the appreciation of an art patron, as da Vinci is enraged and repaints the unhappy frown back onto Lisa. da Vinci and the Pink Panther then repeatedly swap back and forth between the frown and smile until the feline's version of the classic painting ends up in the Louvreâ€”complete with the panther's pink paw print stamped on the painting.
