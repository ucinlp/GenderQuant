This film is a narrative journey from Dante's own hand, through the worst of the afterlife, Inferno. It is a chronological descent to the deepest of Hell, circle by circle to the exit into Purgatory. It features most of Gustave Dore's lithograph illustrations and some excerpts of the 1911 feature film "L'Inferno".
