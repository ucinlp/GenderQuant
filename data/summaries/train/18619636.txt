Porky Pig, featured on the cover of The Westerner, comes to life and sings Ride, Tenderfoot, Ride. Across the way, Daffy Duck, featured on the cover of The Ugly Duckling, comes to life and sings Git Along, Little Dogies. A wolf emerges from The Wolf of Wall Street and lures Daffy to him using a female duck decoy. Daffy follows and grabs what he thinks is the decoy but is actually the wolf's nose. Once he realizes he is in danger, Daffy tells the wolf that he is not worth eating and runs away. Daffy uses the books to defeat the wolf. He opens a copy of The Hurricane to blow the wolf away, and lightning from the book Lightning strikes the wolf. Daffy returns to the decoy. Porky berates him, saying they could never "mean anything to each other." Daffy sticks up his nose and swims away with the decoy, followed by four tiny decoys that look like Daffy.
