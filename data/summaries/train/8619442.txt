Nora Wilder , a single, career woman works at a Manhattan boutique hotel where her excellent skills in guest relations lack in the romantic department. If it is not her loving and dominant mother  attempting to set her up that consistently fail, she has her friendâ€™s  disastrous blind dates to rely on as a backup for further dismay. She's surrounded by friends who are all happily engaged or romantically involved and somehow, love escapes Nora -- until she meets an unusual Frenchman  who helps her discover life beyond her self-imposed boundaries. Also stars Griffin Dunne, Justin Theroux and Drea de Matteo. The film screened at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, and ultimately garnered five award nominations, among them the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay.http://www.google.com/search?clienten&qUTF-8&oe=UTF-8 Retrieved on 2009-04-10
