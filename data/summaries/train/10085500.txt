Strait-laced Magistrate Brutus Poskett  is concerned that his wife  may be older than he believes her to be, especially as his young stepson  seems very precocious for an apparently fifteen year old boy. Mrs Poskett tries to stop an upcoming visit from her first husband's friend , who knows her true age, by confronting him at a local music hall. However, unbeknownst to her, Poskett has also been convinced to go to the music hall with his "adolescent" stepson and, in an ensuing melee, Poskett's wife and her sister are arrested. The following day, Poskett sentences both to seven days imprisonment, failing to recognise them as they are heavily veiled.
