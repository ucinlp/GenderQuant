Miss Prissy goes off to a  hen party, leaving her son Egghead, Jr. behind. Passing by "loafer" Foghorn, Foghorn takes it upon himself to play games with Egghead, Jr. instead of having to read "How to Isolate the Isotope". Although Egghead Jr. "shakes his head when he means yes, and nods when he means no," Foghorn tries playing games with him. Foghorn first tries to explain how to play croquet, but Egghead, Jr. manages to knock the ball through all the wickets . Foghorn then tries playing cops and robbers, but Egghead Jr. blows a whistle, and Foghorn is arrested offscreen. Using his diagram, he marks an X where Foghorn digs out, complete with prison outfit and ball and chain  Next they try playing Indians and Daniel Boone, but Foghorn gets a face full of buckshot when he pulls the cork out of Egghead Jr.'s gun. Foghorn then plays pirates with Egghead, Jr., but when he tries adjusting the 'cannon' , the cannonball winds up bouncing into Foghorn's mouth, knocking him into the lake. Finally, Foghorn goes swimming, and tells Egghead Jr. that he's a "battleship", encouraging him to swim in and "sink me". Egghead Jr. instead winds up a series of mini battleships that shoot at Foghorn, sinking him. When Egghead Jr. pulls Foghorn out of the lake, Miss Prissy comes and berates Foghorn - "Mark my words, one of these days, some of your childish pranks are going to backfire on you." Foghorn gets up, says: "Ma'am, I say ma'am, you are so right!", showing that water is now pouring through the holes he has in his body sustained by Egghead's battleships.
