Helen Leonard  has a beautiful voice. As she grows up, she trains to become an opera singer. Her instructor, however, informs her that her voice is pleasing, but not suitable for grand opera. Returning home one day, she and her grandmother  are saved by a handsome young man, Alexander Moore . Meanwhile, Helen's mother, Cynthia , has political aspirations, but only receives a handful of votes for mayor. While singing one evening, Helen is overheard by Tony Pastor  who hires her to sing at his theater. She is given a new name, Lillian Russell, and quickly rises to fame as the toast of New York. As the years pass, Lillian becomes one of the most revered star in America. She has many suitors, including Diamond Jim Brady , Jesse Lewisohn , and Edward Solomon . She eventually marries Edward and they move to London, where Gilbert and Sullivan are writing an operetta especially for her. Alexander Moore returns and makes a contract with Lillian to write stories about her rise to fame. But tragedy soon strikes when Edward dies one evening while composing a song for her. Lillian cancels the interviews and makes an appearance in the show, singing the song her husband composed for her, "Blue Lovebird". Lillian returns to America and is, by this time, the greatest stage attraction of the century. Alexander returns once more to see Lillian after a new show and the two are happily reunited.
