It's another day in Wellington. The Grisely Painter  is putting up a poster, but has a bad back and his ladder is broken. He is about to give up when a small woman  comes by and helps glue the lower part of the poster to the wall. This catches the attention of a very tall man , who glues the top part of the poster to the wall. When they finish, all three step back and admire the poster. Then suddenly a bus pulls up behind them, the bus driver  lets them come on, and they drive away. The camera pans to the bin and we see that there is the Grisely Painter's roller and pad.
