Both the surreal story by Vladimir Gubarev, together with the 1964 film, written in a Through The Looking Glass style. Alice-type Russian girl, named Olya  meets her counterpart Yalo , while looking into the mirror. Yalo is an absolute antipode to Olya, for example where Yalo is precise and neat, Olya is absent-minded, careless, etc. The explicit plot relates to Olya learning to see herself differently, but this occurs through an experience in the Kingdom of Crooked Mirrors which serves as a mechanism for commenting on the ability of a society to manufacture a false reality . The two girls find themselves on an adventure to save Gurd , imprisoned for refusing to make crooked mirrors. He is jailed by the kingdom's evil forces, the trio Anidag , Nushrok (Korshun, meaning [[Kite  and Abazh . They meet Aunt Askal , The King's Chef, who helped them on their journey by hiding them and dressing them up as two pages of the King Yagupop the 77th . On meeting the king, the girls realise the extent of his stupidity, and discover who is really in charge . The King's idiocy may suggest that such a system should be easy to dupe, at least from the inside, as the girls do. Despite, Olya's bumbling mistakes, Gurd is saved, and evil is defeated. Olya returns to her grandmother and the kingdom's mirrors are not crooked any more, implying that it is now a free society. The film can be interpreted in numerous ways depending upon the viewers own history and the timing of viewing, which clearly illustrates{{Citation needed}} that we all live in our own Kingdom of Crooked Mirrors.
