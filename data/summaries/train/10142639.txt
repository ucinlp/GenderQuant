The movie is set in Socialist ruled Yugoslavia during 1950s. Zoran is a slightly overweight 10-year-old living in an overcrowded home that his parents share with his grandmother, and aunt and uncle. In the communist era of Yugoslavia, many homes were taken away from their owners in the Land Reform programs. Zoran's family is opposed to Tito's rule, while little Zoran sees Tito as his personal hero. He's learned in school that Tito is greatest man ever, and, for a child, this propaganda was very believable. Zoran will, during a field trip learn more about his hero.
