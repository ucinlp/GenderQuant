Stan and Ollie arrive in high spirits for their new jobs at the sawmill and after walking into planks of wood Stan traps Ollie's hands in a window frame. After freeing him they trick a shop worker ([[Charlie Hall  into smoking despite a "No Smoking" sign. Stan then tears a strip off Ollie's pants with a plane and in the resulting 'tit for tat' dips a paintbrush in glue and sticks it onto Ollie's chin. Finding it is not possible to pull it off he prepares like a barber and shaves it with a plane. Ollie then gets propelled through a ventilator duct and out of an attic vent port and their car gets sawed in two lengthwise by a large band saw.
