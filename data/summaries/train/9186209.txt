The "bujang lapok" trio of Ramli, Sudin and Ajis go to Jalan Ampas Studio, Singapore in response to an open call audition. During their audition, they drive director Ahmad Nisfu crazy by forgetting the script and improvising with their own lines. However, the studio boss likes their natural comedic talent and tells the director that the trio are to be signed on for an oncoming film. Back at home, Ramlee is in love with a nurse, Cik Salmah, who is being watched by Sharif Dol, a villain from a neighbouring village. Sharif Dol sends his mother to propose but Salmah turns him down. The vengeful Sharif Dol burns down the entire village to get even, but is later arrested for his crime.
