Jenny Monroe  is a typical all American teenage girl, who has a falling out with her best friend Ellen Holloway  and doesn't return home. Jenny's mother, Jean , is worried for her daughter, and three days later, Jenny's body is discovered in a creek with a 100 pound log across her back. Furious about the murder, Ellen and Jean both try and track down the killer. Ellen and her daughter, Celeste, move into Jean's house. Ellen had wanted Jenny's room, but Jean had Ellen sleeping in her bedroom, as Jenny's room was later turned into a nursery for when her grandchild would visit. Three years later with the police still unable to solve Jenny's murder, Kathy Pearl, another friend of Jenny, comes forward out of guilt. Kathy tells the police she was brought along with the girls  when they attacked Jenny by slapping her, chopping off pieces of her hair, and then finally drowning her. Kathy claims they did it because they believed Jenny had slept with their boyfriends, but during the trial it was revealed that the plain and overweight Ellen was jealous of Jenny's popularity and beauty and wanted "to be her". Kathy told the police she fled town because Ellen threatened her if she talked.
