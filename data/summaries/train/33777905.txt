The Pink Panther lives a simple life as Tarzan in the jungle, but soon begins to irritate a gorilla. After several failed attempts to keep the temperamental primate under control, he discovers that the music drifting out of a transistor radio charms the gorilla and makes him start dancing. Then the ape swallows the radio by mistake, but the music still keeps drifting from inside the stomach. The panther finds out the right way to get rid of the happily dancing ape; by walking him into a local zoo.
