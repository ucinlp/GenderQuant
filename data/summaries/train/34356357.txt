Bharathan is a post-graduate and unemployed. Somehow he manages to get the job of a Malayalam teacher at a tuition centre. His wife Geetha works in a consumer store. The couple stays in a rented house owned by Kariyachan. Bharathan is a genius inventor and has a rather inquisitive mind especially as far as scientific matters are concerned. He is always around inventions with little care on what happens around him. He never sticks to any particular job, which lands his family in deep financial troubles. His wife Geetha is upset about all this, but little could she do to avoid her husband from becoming the laughing stock of many who don't understand him. Some people like Kariachan  cleverly usurp the patent rights of some of Bharathan's crude inventions. The few people who come with helping hands are Thankachan, one of his students in the tuition centre and Peter, who goes around finding him new jobs. In the meantime Bharathan invents a gadget that could be used to clean and sweep the courtyard and also to pluck coconuts and fruits from palms and trees. One day, on the way to take classes, Bharathan notices a paper rocket-flown by some children-staying midair for an unusually long period of time. This and a few other experiences lead him to a very spectacular discovery relating to gravity. But people around him brand him a lunatic and that leads to many problems in his life. But Bharathan does discover the reason behind the phenomenon is antigravity and claims that he can make flying objects that can be used by man to reach any destination without any fuel, and he suddenly gets famous. But due to over concentration, Bharathan loses his memory about the project. The government brings a psychiatrist to cure him. He finds that with some seemingly fatal interventions, Bharathan could be cured and he could make anti gravity to a workable.
