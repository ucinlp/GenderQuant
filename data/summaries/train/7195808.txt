Lola takes place in the Atlantic coastal city of Nantes, France. A young man, Roland Cassard  is letting his life waste away until he has a chance encounter with Lola , a woman he used to know as a teenager before World War II and who is now a cabaret dancer. Though Roland is quite smitten with her, Lola is preoccupied with her former lover, Michel, who abandoned her and her seven-year-old son years before. Also vying for Lola's heart is an American sailor, Frankie , whose affection Lola does not return. Struggling for work, Roland gets involved in a diamond-smuggling plot with the local barber. Cécile , a young teenage girl, crosses paths with Roland; her life in many ways mirrors that of Lola's, whose actual name is also Cécile. In the end, Michel returns to Nantes for Lola, apparently very successful and hoping to marry her, just as she is leaving for another job in Marseille and Roland is also leaving town. Their paths do not cross.
