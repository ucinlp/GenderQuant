Four teenagers representing the four main "races" are chosen to participate in a Survivor-style television show. They are: * Alex Chang  * Leo Bryant * Jackie Rodriguez  * Margaret Tim  On the way to their filming location, their plane is brought down by an electrical storm. As the plane falls, they parachute out onto what appears to be an island, landing on an isolated mesa. The island, however, is inhabited by a variety of dinosaurs, including Iguanodon, Stegosaurus, Triceratops, Pterosaur, Velociraptor and Tyrannosaurus. The island is also inhabited by a form of unfriendly prehistoric human, Homo habilis. Putting aside their differences, the foursome endeavour to escape from both dinosaurs and a tribe of Homo habilis.
