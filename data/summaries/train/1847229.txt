Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson is paroled from Sing Sing by the warden, who is impressed by Johnson's conduct while incarcerated, but believes Johnson does not regret committing the murder that sent him to prison. Johnson returns to Harlem and reunites with friends, most notably Illinois Gordon. Johnson is quickly established as a highly respected member of the community, and his friends include Stephanie "Madam Queen" St. Clair, who runs the numbers racket in Harlem despite competition from the Italian Mafia. Dutch Schultz, a Mafia associate who reports to Lucky Luciano, asks to partner with the Queen, who declines the offer, as she disapproves of the violent tactics Schultz has taken to terrorize her customers. Friends with the chief of police, Schultz arranges for the Queen to be arrested, and the Queen asks Johnson to take charge of the business during her incarceration. The Queen instructs that Johnson avoid bloodshed, but Schultz's men grow increasingly violent. Most of the film divides its attention between the mob war that results, and Johnson's relationships with other Harlem residents, most notably a romance with Red Cross nurse Francine Hughes. A key subplot centers around the increasingly antagonistic relationship between Schultz, who wants to become a boss in his own right, and Luciano, who is pressured by prosecutor Thomas Dewey to keep Schultz in check.
