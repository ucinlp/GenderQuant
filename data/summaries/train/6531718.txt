A company known as Wholesale Souls Inc. is buying and selling human souls. A group of teens find out about this company and a boy by the name of James Young decides to sell his soul on the internet. The soul is shortly thereafter purchased by Stan L. McReynolds, the CEO of Wholesale Souls Inc. Before long, James descends in to paranoia. James goes to Wholesale Souls with the hope of buying back his soul. Stan refuses and explains that souls do not exist in the eyes of the law, so there is nothing James can demand the return of. He begins to lose control of his life after his close friend Warren dies in a car accident. James feels that he is responsible for the death of Warren and the guilt destroys him. In the end, James kills himself.
