Babla  is a kid who lives in a village with his mother . His mother sends him to his sister's  place  so that he can go to a good school. Initially, Babla likes both school as well as sister's home very much and becomes a good friend with Pappu , his classmate. They roam around in streets, watch street magic show and wish they could do such tricks, look inquisitively at how sweets are made, make fun of teacher etc. They enjoy, as any kid will, all these things thoroughly. But Babla gets reminded of the harsh reality of life when his sister and brother-in-law starts scolding him for his disinterest in studies and complaints from the school regarding his so-called irresponsible behavior . He gets to realize that nobody understands kids, their innocence, their view of life and he will have to grow up to enjoy life fully. One thing leads to another and one day Babla decides that he will be better off living with his mother in village. He runs off and get on a train. Since he does not have any ticket, ticket-master catches him and makes him get off on the next station. In the night he feels cold and look around for some shelter. He finds an old woman sleeping in a blanket and lie down besides her sharing the blanket. In the morning, finding the old beggar woman still sleeping, he picks up a coin from her container and goes off to drink water. While drinking water he sees that lot of people have gathered around the old lady. He goes there and finds out that the lady he had been sleeping with was dead. He gets scared to his core and realizes that life is, in fact, not that simple for those who are poor. He puts back the coin he had taken and run off to his mother's place. There he finds his mother, sister and brother-in-law worrying about him. They are overjoyed to see Babla back and Babla promises to everyone that he will study sincerely and never create troubles for anyone.
