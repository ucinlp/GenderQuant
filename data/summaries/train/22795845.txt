Zachariah Block is a shut-in who spends much of his day compulsively sorting and resorting ordinary objects into jars. His routine changes when a woman moves into the apartment next door. By listening to her movements through the walls and watching her through a vent, he becomes drawn into her life. When he senses that she is in danger, this very eccentric and alienated character overcomes his debilitating fears, summons up a small act of genuine courage, and saves his neighbors life.
