A weary Donald pulls his car up to a motel in the wilderness. After finding that only the cot on the porch is available, and costs $16, he drives away to find a spot to set up his loud air mattress. As typical, Donald does not have an easy night sleep as he desperately tries to pump up the mattress and get some sleep. He inadvertently causes a rockslide that crushes his car and after, he rolls into a river sleeping with a fish. Finally Donald gets some sleep but unknowingly a springy tree's branch strongly inflate the mattress with the pump and when it propelled all the way back right into the motel's cot, Donald is charged the $16, but only spends a matter of seconds before being kicked off the cot and falls in the arms of a cactus, but still sleeping.
