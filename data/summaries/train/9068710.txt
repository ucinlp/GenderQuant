Small-time crook, Champak Chaudhary alias 'Champ'  forges passports, photographs, and deeds in Thailand. He is arrested by the police, tried and sentenced to six months in jail. This is where he meets a supposedly mute and deaf inmate, Raghu Sharma , serving a life sentence for stealing diamonds. Champ finds out that Raghu is not deaf nor mute and offers him a share if he springs him out of prison; Champ agrees. As soon as Champ's term is over, he gets discharged and prepares forged release documents for Raghu and gets him legally out of jail. The two then hide in a house deep in the country, where Raghu is re-united with his daughter, Jia . Champ arranges for two fake passports for him and Raghu and get them two new identities: While he is now Anthony Gonzales, Raghu and Jia get Muslim names. Things do not go exactly as planned as Raghu gets killed! Champ and Jia decide to part ways. But when Jia tells Champ she knows where the diamonds are buried, they agree on a partnership. Jia takes him where her dad had buried them &mdash; right in the compound of a penitentiary! While Champ plans to break back into prison, Madan , an underworld Don, orders his hit-men to get hold of Anthony Gonzales and kill him &mdash; as Anthony has evidence that may link him to the murder of a young woman. Champ, who is now officially known as Anthony, will now use all the resources available to stay alive and, if possible, get the diamonds from the prison compound. This movie's story line is inspired by  the 2001 Hollywood movie Who Is Cletis Tout?
