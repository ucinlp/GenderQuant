Strength and Honour tells the story of an Irish-American boxer, Sean Kelleher , who accidentally kills his friend in the ring and promises his wife that he will never box again. However, years later, when he discovers that his only son is dying of the same hereditary heart disorder which has taken his wife, he is forced to break his promise in order to raise the substantial funds needed for the surgery that could save his sonâ€™s life. Strength and Honour is a story of hope and love, sacrifice and devotion, set against the violent underground world of Irish bare-knuckle boxing.
