Dublin, 1904. Walking down Dublin's Nassau Street, James Joyce meets Nora Barnacle, a young and attractive woman from Galway. Joyce, immediately in love with the young woman, offers to 'show her the city'. Nora coldly states that she has to work. The film then proceeds to examine the relationship between Joyce and Barnacle. We witness the good times and the bad times, the birth and growth of their two children  and how Joyce battles with his publishers and, indeed, the censors over his first published work, Dubliners.
