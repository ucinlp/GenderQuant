A snowstorm leaves everyone in the House of Mouse stranded and "bah-humbug" Donald doesn't have any Christmas spirit. Mickey and all the other guests get hot chocolate and cookies to make Donald feel his Christmas spirit. The fun starts when Minnie gets the Christmas cartoons to watch. Their magical memories see to it that everyone has a holiday spirit, even Donald. At the end, everyone gets together and sings a musical number, "The Best Christmas of All". Among the Christmas cartoons included in this special are Mickey's Christmas Carol and a comic version of The Nutcracker narrated by John Cleese, and starring Mickey as the Nutcracker, Minnie Mouse as Clara, Donald Duck as the Mouse King, Ludwig von Drake as a Drosselmeyer-like character, and Goofy as the Sugar Plum Fairy.
