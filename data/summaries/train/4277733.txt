When the evil "Black Section of Esoteric Buddhism" had tried to invade Tibet years ago, the Tibetan monks used a powerful magical item, the "Babu Gold Bottle" to expel them. The Tibetan master  has the bottle's cap and wishes to reunite it with the bottle as the Black Section are stirring once more. He sends a young monk, Wong La  to Hong Kong to recover the sacred bottle, which is in the possession of a crippled lawyer. Wong meets and protects a woman, Chiu Seng-Neng  who is acting as the agent for the lawyer, and the Black Section fight to gain the magical bottle for themselves. The leader of the Black Section  learns of the intended hand-over, and seeks to get the Babu Gold Bottle for himself.
