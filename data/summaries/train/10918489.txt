The story follows two orphans, Kuro and Shiro, as they attempt to control and cope with the violence they find on the streets of the pan-Asian metropolis of Treasure Town. Kuro is a streetwise punk, while Shiro is an innocent dope, out of touch with the world around him. First, they take on thugs, religious fanatics and yakuza. And when a corporation called "Kiddy Kastle" conceives plans to tear down and rebuild Treasure Town to fit its own goals, Kuro and Shiro work together to prevent this.
