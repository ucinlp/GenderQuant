The story follows Dr. Sonny Blake , a radio talk show psychiatrist, when she moves back to her childhood home after her alcoholic father dies. Once back in her old neighborhood, she meets the local paperboy, a cunning, depraved sociopath who targeted her father and now targets her. When the boy starts calling her show and reciting eerie nursery rhymes, an unnerving game of cat-and-mouse begins. When the game escalates, she suddenly finds herself in an all-out war, one that forces her to redefine her ideas of good and evil, and has her fighting to stay alive.{{cite web}}
