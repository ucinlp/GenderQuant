Stephen and his daughter Justine run from a wireless internet ghost of Michelle, Stephen's late wife. The father and daughter stay at the Stephen's cabin, away from the city. A short while after they get there, Stephen's girlfriend Marta arrives. As Stephen and Marta are about to get intimate, a laptop sitting on the table turns on, revealing continuous emails to Stephen from Michelle. Marta ends up hitting the laptop with a golf club, but while everyone is asleep Stephen picks up the laptop and sends an e-mail to Michelle, causing her to appear at the cabin. Michelle kills Marta, but Stephen and Justine escape. They are stopped by a man dressed in red, who commands Stephen at gunpoint to take him to a computer supply store and find a processor for him. With the processor, the man plans to find a solution for the world. Once Stephen completes this, the man gives him red tape and Stephen and Justine keep driving. They stop in the middle of a road, where Stephen covers the car in red tape. He and Justine fall asleep, but Stephen wakes up in the middle of the night to find the passenger-side door open and Justine missing. He manages to get Justine back before she touches her mother's ghost and they race back to the car. The next day, Stephen peeks through the tape and sees a bus destined to a refugee camp where wireless computer signals cannot reach. He and Justine get off, and he tells her to run straight to the bus. As they are about to reach it, Michelle appears. Stephen convinces his daughter that she should get on the bus and sacrifices himself to Michelle, saying that if she did not want to be lonely, she should take him and not their daughter. As she is about to touch his face, she backs off and disappears with a smile. Stephen is relieved and thanks her, but Marta's ghost clings to him and takes his soul. Marta then backs off and Michelle is shown standing there smiling. Justine is safely in the bus with other refugees and escapes unscathed.
