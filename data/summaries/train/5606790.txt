Laurel and Hardy are hired as a chef and butler to assist a dizzy society matron in entertaining visiting royalty from the country of Orlandia. The royalty is headed by young King Christopher, who would much rather play football than run a country. The duo are then hired away by the King's Uncle Saul, who is secretly planning to dispose of the boy in order to inherit the throne.
