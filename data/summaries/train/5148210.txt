Cheeni Kum focuses on Buddhadev Gupta . Buddhadev is the 64-year old chef and owner of London's top Indian restaurant, Spice 6. He lives with his 85-year old mother, and his only friend and confidante is his 9-year old neighbour, Sexy . Buddhadev Gupta is an arrogant, ego-centric, pompous man with a singular passion in lifeâ€”cooking. He is a confirmed bachelor who has never been in love until 34-year old Nina Verma ([[Tabu  walks into his restaurant and life. Nina is a beautiful and charming Indian woman. Cool, calm, quiet, always smiling, but independent and strong willed. The two extreme in age, character, and attitude meet and against all odds fall in love. They decide to get married, and, like any Indian man, Buddhadev respectfully comes to ask Nina's father, Omprakash Verma , who is a true Gandhian, living in Delhi, for her hand. The main problem here is the fact that Omprakash is 6 years younger than Buddhadev.
