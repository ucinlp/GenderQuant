Luftwaffe fighter pilot Franz von Werra  is shot down during the Battle of Britain, and captured. He bets the RAF interrogator at the POW reception centre [Air Defence Intelligence, Cockfosters ] that he will escape and return to Germany within six months. He is initially sent to a prisoner of war  camp in Furness, Cumbria . His first escape sees him recaptured after five or six days while hiding in a muddy hole on a moor, and von Werra is sent to a more secure POW camp  near Swanwick, [Derbyshire]. He and four others escape through a tunnel. The others pair up, but von Werra goes it alone. Reaching Codnor Park railway station, he impersonates a Netherlands [Dutch] pilot whose Vickers Wellington Wellington bomber has crashed while on a secret mission. He telephones the nearest airfield, [RAF Hucknall], and cons the duty officer into sending a car. When his story starts to fray, von Werra sneaks away and tries to steal an experimental Hawker Hurricane, only to be caught at the last moment. He and many other POWs are sent by ship to Canada. On the train ride across the country, von Werra escapes near [Smiths Falls, Ontario] by opening and jumping from a window while the guards are distracted. He makes his way south, and crossing the nearly frozen St Lawrence River using a stolen rowboat, reaches Ogdensburg, New York in the United States, which at that time was still neutral, and claims asylum. The RAF interrogator receives a postcard from von Werra posted from New York [Statue of Liberty picture] informing him that he has lost his bet. After Von Werra reached Germany, he was lost while on a patrol over the sea, probably due to engine failure, but there were no witnesses.
