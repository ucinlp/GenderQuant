Long ago, a great drought befell a village. A dancer from a traditional family came forth to dance in the Shiva temple for many days and nights. Her dedication to Lord Shiva and the village earn her the respect of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. They bless the village with rains ending the drought. The dancer's dying wish was that a girl from her family must dance on pournami  every 12 years in front of Lord Shiva temple. This brings us to present day - another 12th year when the dance will take place. Pournami , the elder daughter of the family goes missing. Rumors of her eloping are rampant among the villagers, much to her father's chagrin. Pournami's younger sister Chandrakala  never learnt the dance as her father refused to teach her . Chandrakala's stepmother rules the house with an iron fist and has rented out the extra room of their house to earn some extra money - who should take the room but Shiva Keshava , a Western-style dance instructor! The film follows Chandrakala and Shiva's growing relationship, as they navigate family connections and a lecherous zamindar  to prepare for the next Pournami dance ritual.
