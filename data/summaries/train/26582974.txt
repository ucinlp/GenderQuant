This film documentary uses the 1967 Six-Day War and its immediate aftermath as its basis.Cowie, Peter. 1977. World Filmography: 1967, London: Tantivy Press, pg. 294. ISBN 0-498-01565-3 The material primarily presents Israeli sources and perspectives. It has been characterized as an anti-war screed. The film was panned for presenting little footage documenting the war, as well as for conflicting, alternating viewpoints and overall lack of narrative focus.Survival 1967, Adler, Renata, The New York Times, movie review, 12 June 1968.
