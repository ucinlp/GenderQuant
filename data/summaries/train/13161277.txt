The downtown streets of Popeye and Olive Oyl's town are flooded with crowds who have turned out to hear various presidential candidates trying to convince voters to elect them to the White House. Olive wonders aloud why no women are running for president, to which Popeye replies, "because they're too busy runnin' fer huskbands!" Undaunted, Olive is certain what the United States needs is a female president, an idea Popeye ridicules mercilessly. Olive beans Popeye over the head with a frying pan, and snarls "Yes, if I were President..." Unconscious, Popeye suddenly finds himself in a fantasy world where Olive herself is on stage appealing to voters in song. Olive promises luxuries such as clean streets decorated with bows, giant ice cream cones for children, and creative solutions to public transportation and housing shortages. The once skeptical Popeye now applauds his girlfriend's dream, and, to his delight, Olive wins the election. She becomes the country's first female President, and quickly tames a Congress populated with literal representations of the two major political parties: jackass Democrats and elephant [[Republican Party . Popeye awakens from his dream with a changed heart, and Olive Oyl soon finds herself riding a parade float, dressed as the Statue of Liberty, as an enthusiastic Popeye shouts into the crowd, "for Presidink...Olive Oyl!"
