The Stooges, employed as traveling salesmen, join the Woman Haters Club. They swear never to get romantically involved with a woman. That does not last very long. Jim finds an attractive woman, Mary , falls in love, and has proposed marriage. Misogynists Tom and Jack talk him out of it. However during the party, Mary's intimidating father threatens Jim to marry his attractive daughter by telling him a story about his other, unattractive daughter having a fiance who tried to abandon her on their wedding day. He and his brothers had roughed him up for it but also forced him to go through with the ceremony. Jim is convinced to go through the ceremony much to the man's dismay. Later, on a train ride, the confrontation escalates between the Stooges and Mary. Mary uses her feminine charm to woo both Jack and Tom in an attempt to make Jim jealous. She sings a theme  with each of the stooges in turn, as she flirts with them. Each is attracted to her charms as she proves the oath they swore as Women Haters was fraudulent. Finally, Mary tells Tom and Jack the truth, that she and Jim are married, and pushes her way into bed with the trio, knocking them out the train window in the process. The film closes as the Stooges, now old men, finally reunite  sharing their hatred of women and old age. What happened to Mary is not revealed.
