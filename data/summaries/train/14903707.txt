Muniyandi , a third year college student and the darling son of Muthumani  comes across as an average fun-loving guy. Matters become colourful when a demure young daughter, Madumitha  of a local bigwig, Ramaiyya gives first preference to the members of his caste. Madumitha makes a coquettish play for all of Muniyandi's friends, but hits it off with him first. Following a heated skirmish in the caste-dominated college elections, the two fall in love. Or so you think. Also part of the mix is Sorimuthu Ayyanar , who raises some laughs as the local witch-doctor, complete with bells and saffron cloth regalia. But everything goes topsy-turvy when, once Madumitha's marriage is arranged, she turns around and says that she was never in love with Muniyandi in the first place. Furious, the guy thrashes her with his slippers and sets fire to her father's coconut grove. It is little things like these that set this movie slightly apart from others in the same genre; the hero and heroines come across as genuine characters, angry, sad and sorrowful. Madumitha is no slinking pathetic thing either; she gives back as good as she gets. But its time for the caste card to be played again and as Muniyandi discovers the secret behind his brothers death.
