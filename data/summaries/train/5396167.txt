Chris Walters is a happily married father of two. For his 13th wedding anniversary, he sneaks home with a gift for wife Alice, a diamond brooch, and with a desire to have a romantic interlude. Interruptions ensue. If it isn't their daughters, Debbie and Okkie, needing something, it's their maid, Millie, or it's Alice's mother on the phone. And then two delivery men arrive with a new television set. It's a gift from Alice's parents, Lilly and Arthur. Chris is not pleased. He hates television. He thinks the whole idea of TV is a needless distraction and corrupting influence on today's youth. At work, Chris has a partner, Bud, who is trying to woo a new client, Jeanette Revere, a woman who has been divorced four times. Jeanette is amazed in this day and age that a couple can remain happily married as long as the Walterses have. Over a celebration dinner, Chris lets it slip that he and Alice didn't need TV when they first met because they were already romantically involved. Lilly and Arthur are offended, having been under the impression that Alice didn't have relations with Chris until they were wed. They storm out. Chris is so angry, he kicks in the screen of the new TV. He argues with Alice and has to spend his anniversary night sleeping on the sofa. A gift arrives from Bud -- it's another TV. Chris is irritated again but promises not to cause a scene this time. When they turn it on, however, a show called "Kids Council" has his daughter Debbie as a guest. And the child blurts out for all to hear that her parents are having marital difficulties and had been intimate prior to their wedding. Chris again kicks in the TV. Alice throws her husband out of the house this time. Meantime, her parents also have a quarrel, which leads to Lilly moving in with her daughter. Everybody's angry now. A distraught Chris wants to come home. Alice feels no one cares about her. She intends to leave home herself. The family doctor, however, suddenly informs Alice that she is pregnant. She decides to give Chris another chance ... as a gift from him arrives, yet another TV.
