Later, Kovalan falls for the beautiful, dissolute dancer Madhavi , who leads him to ruin. Kannagi comes in at the last moment and saves him from almost certain debauchery. She also offers to sell her golden anklet to restore the household's depleted funds. Unfortunately, the artistry and value of the object leads the king of a neighboring land to accuse Kovalan of theft and sentence him to the chopping block. Once again, Kannagi comes in at the last moment and proves to the king and the queen that they are innocent, causing them both to die instantly. After razing Madhavi's native village to the ground, Kannagi ascends to heaven.
