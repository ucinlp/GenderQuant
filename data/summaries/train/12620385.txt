Jack, Steve and Goat are East End London "spivs"  who spend their days wheeling and dealing whenever and wherever they can. But not until they're landed with the juicy payoff they have been waiting for, involving a shady character who calls himself Villa, do they realize the trouble they've gotten themselves into. After opening a truck door thing they discover they weren't smuggling merchandise, rather they were smuggling people. The people run out of the cargo area. Jack is mad at Steve for not checking. Then suddenly they discover two small children a girl and a boy. Now they are in even more trouble.
