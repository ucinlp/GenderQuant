Yeh hui na mardon wali baat or Now that's more like a man is the Pakistani contribution to a South Asian film project. It has taken a rather peculiar angle to look into the issue of masculinity. Though it's a film about men, there aren't any in it. The film looks at the issue through the eyes of women! The film is a juxtaposing of a series of interview clips of women from different backgrounds. The only common bond among them is that they all hail from Lahore. As these women talk about men in their capacities as brothers, husbands, fathers, lovers etc., a sort of profile of an ideal man emerges. What does the society these women come from, expect of a man?
