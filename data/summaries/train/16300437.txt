During World War I, in the British trenches at Passchendaele, an army private, Arthur Hamp  is accused of desertion. He is to be defended at his trial by Capt. Hargreaves , an upper-class officer. Hamp had been a volunteer at the outbreak of the war and was the sole survivor of his company but then decided to 'go for a walk': he had contemplated walking to his home in London but after more than 24 hours on the road, he's picked up by the Military Police and sent back to his unit to face court-martial for desertion. Hargreaves is initially arrogant towards the simple-minded Hamp but comes to identify with his plight. With testimony from a doctor , the soldier must be made an example of in front of the other soldiers. He is found guilty and is shot by a firing squad but as he is still alive afterwards, he is then shot through the mouth. The action is confined to the mud-entrenched, rat-infested confines of the trenches and barracks. The film shows a grim picture of life in the trenches during the war.
