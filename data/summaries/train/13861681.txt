Set in London and the south of England in 1929, the story finds the Duc de Richelieu  investigating the strange actions of the son of a friend, Simon Aron, who has a house complete with strange markings and a pentagram. He quickly deduces that Simon is involved with the Occult. Richelieu and Rex van Rijn rescue Simon and another young initiate, Tanith, from a devil worshipping cult. During the rescue they disrupt a ceremony on Salisbury Plain in which Satan himself appears. They escape to the home of the Eatons, friends of Richelieu and van Rijn, and are followed by the group's leader, Mocata, who has a psychic connection to the two initiates. After visiting the house to discuss the matter and an unsuccessful attempt to influence the initiates to return, Mocata forces Richelieu and the other occupants to defend themselves through a night of black magic attacks, ending with the conjuring of the angel of death. His attacks defeated, Mocata kidnaps little Peggy. Simon tries to rescue her, but is recaptured by the group. The Duc, Richard, and Peggy's family, also try to save her, but they are defeated by Mocata. Suddenly, a powerful force, possibly Hecate, the queen of all witches and ruler of all magic, possesses Mrs. Eaton and puts a stop to Peggy's trance. She then leads Peggy in the recitation of a spell, which kills all of the cultists and transforms their coven room into a church. When the Duc and his companions awaken, they discover that the spell Peggy was led into casting has reversed time and changed the future. Simon and Tanith have survived, while Mocata's spell to conjure the angel of death has been reflected back on him. He now pays the price of loss of life and eternal damnation of his soul for having wrongly summoned the angel of death.
