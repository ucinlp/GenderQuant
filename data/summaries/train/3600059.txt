A period comedy set in 1985, the story chronicles the adventures of Brian Jackson, a student in his first year at Bristol University. A somewhat geeky gifted accumulator of knowledge, Brian has been a fan since childhood of University Challenge. That TV show's famous catchphrase—"Your starter for 10"—gives the film its title. Soon after arriving at university, he seizes upon the opportunity to join Bristol's University Challenge team. He promptly falls for his glamorous teammate Alice, though he may be more compatible with a Jewish counterculturalist friend, Rebecca. Additionally, Brian finds himself caught between his new life, amongst the academic university set, and his old, with his working-class family and friends in the seaside town of Southend-on-Sea, Essex.
