Eschewing the traditional rockumentary methods of archival performance and interviews, director Gorman Bechard instead relies on fans to tell the story of The Replacements, one of the most underrated bands in rock and roll history. Some of these fans are more well known than others, as members of Husker Du, The Goo Goo Dolls, The Hold Steady, The Decemberists, The Gaslight Anthem, Babes in Toyland, and many other famous musicians retrace the band's story from their humble beginnings in Minneapolis to their legendary onstage breakup on July 4, 1991. The heart of the story, though, comes from "ordinary" fans. Some saw the band hundreds of times during their tenure; others only saw a show or two. Bechard not only covers the highs of their early shows and recordings, he also honestly discusses the controversial firing of guitarist Bob Stinson and the gradual softening of their sound. According to The Village Voice it's the "rock version of Rashomon."
