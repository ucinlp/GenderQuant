Dr. Peña , a cryptozoologist, manages to capture a live chupacabra on a remote Caribbean island and smuggles it aboard the cruise ship Regent Queen, commanded by Captain Randolph  with the assistance of his young daughter, and ship fitness instructor, Jenny . The Regent Queen has been experiencing a rash of burglaries, and Federal Marshal Lance Thompson  is brought on board to investigate. The creature soon escapes from captivity, leaving the passengers at its mercy on the sea. U.S. Navy Seals are called in to help stop the creature, but their efforts are hindered by Dr. Peña, who believes the creature's life is more valuable than the lives of those aboard. The Navy Seals are killed off one by one by the beast and Dr. Pena resorts to using Jenny as live bait to recapture the Chupacabra. However, he is foiled when the beast outsmarts and fatally wounds him. Jenny is saved by Lance and they meet up with her father, who has set the engines to explode as all the other passengers have been evacuated. They flee on a lifeboat moments before the ship blows up, taking the beast with it. Captain Randolph decides to retire and write his memoirs.
