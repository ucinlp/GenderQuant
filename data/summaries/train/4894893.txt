Set in the American Southwest, Doc  is an alcoholic security watchman protecting digging equipment from environmental activists, though he befriends one of them named Thrush . Meanwhile, Dr. Jane Tiptree  of the Eunice Corporation is breeding a strain of extra large and fertile chickens by splicing their DNA with that of crocodiles, iguanas, albatrosses, and ostriches. Unknown to the Corporation's sponsors however, Triptree is impregnating several of the chickens with dinosaur DNA. One of her resulting creatures, a Deinonychus, escapes and kills the activists, as well as other civilians. Doc investigates and discovers that Tiptree is also creating a virus which causes women to fatally conceive baby dinosaurs, in order to wipe out humanity and thus allow Carnosaurs and Raptors to reclaim the Earth as their own. After narrowly escaping a Tyrannosaurus and the lab, Doc and Thrush battle it with skidsteers near the end of the film . The government infiltrates the community in order to "sterilize" the situation by shooting all the civilians, infected or not. In the end, Thrush dies from the virus and Doc is shot by government soldiers, then their bodies are burned.
