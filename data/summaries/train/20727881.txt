{{expand section}} On Christmas Eve, the Muppets go to the post office in New York City to deliver each of their letters to Santa Claus . When they head back to their apartment, Gonzo discovers that three letters wound up in his coat from a mishap there. One of those letters he recognizes as being written by his friend, a neighbor girl named Claire . On Gonzo's insistence, the principal Muppets decide to go to the North Pole and deliver them personally. The Muppets end up getting tickets from a North Pole Airlines clerk named Joy  and getting caught by Officer Frank Meany  who, for being a bully, perpetually ended up on Santa's naughty list. They eventually reach the North Pole to find that Santa has already left to deliver the presents. Santa overhears their grieving and doubles back, where they hand him Claire's letter and the other two which are revealed to have come from Frank Meany  and Pepe the King Prawn. Santa brings them home to New York in time to spend the rest of the holiday with Claire and her mom, which was all Claire wanted in the first place.
