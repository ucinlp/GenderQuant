Renjani , a former ballerina and rape victim who aborted the resulting foetus, and Wid , a doctor and daughter of a prostitute, are two women who volunteer at an orphanage for children with several disabilities in Yogyakarta. One day, while practicing her dancing, Renjani notes that Dewa , a tiny eight-year-old with autism and brain damage, is responding. This convinces her that music therapy could promote healing. Renjani later asks Bhisma , a violinist that she met by chance, to assist him; they later fall in love. After Bhisma writes a song, "Biola Tak Berdawai", for Dewa, he prepares for a recital. Renjani and Dewa attend the recital, but Renjani faints and is rushed to the hospital; the cause is later discovered to be cervical cancer. After a week in a coma, Renjani dies; at her grave, Dewa plays "Biola Tak Berdawai" as Bhisma listens.
