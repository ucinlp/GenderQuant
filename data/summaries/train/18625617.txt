The king disapproves what his brother did but he doesn't like what Angélique is doing. He sends his best policeman to her, the former lawyer of Jeoffrey, Desgrez. He promises her a license to make and sell chocolate and 50.000 livres as compensation for the loss of "Le masque rouge", on the condition that she stops publishing the pamphlets and Monsieur's name isn't mentioned.
