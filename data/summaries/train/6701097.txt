The Royal Navy is concerned about constant attacks on convoys by German submarines and having to keep "half the fleet" watching for the German battleship Tirpitz. The Tirpitz is 60&nbsp;km from the sea inside a Norwegian fjord and attempts by the Royal Air Force to sink her have failed. Commander Fraser  is determined to prove that an attack by human torpedoes is practical, despite scepticism from the higher echelons that such an operation would be feasible,. Fraser assembles and trains a force of officers and ratings to use the Mk I Human Torpedo manned torpedoes  at their Scottish base. After receiving a refusal to allow the operation to go ahead from an admiral, the team use dummy mines to attack the admiral's own ship using the "Chariots". An attack is authorised on the Tirpitz with the initial operation using the "Chariots". The attack fails and the crew are forced to abandon ship and land in Norway. They walk to neutral Sweden from where they are returned to Scotland. For the next operation the crews are trained to use three small X-Craft submarines: X1, X2 and X3. They are initially towed by conventional submarines and are then left to penetrate the area where the Tirpitz is anchored. They manage to approach the ship under their own power to lay their "side-cargoes", each containing 2 tons of Amatol, under the ship's hull undetected. Two crews then scuttle the submarines and are picked up by the crew of Tirpitz, to be taken away as POWs. The third  is too badly damaged to re-surface and the crew decide to stay on board to prevent "giving the game away". The mines explode as planned, badly damaging the Tirpitz. Meanwhile, X2's side cargoes have flooded. The flooding causes them to spontaneously explode, destroying X2 and killing her crew.
