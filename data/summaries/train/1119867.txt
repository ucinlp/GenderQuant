Private Donald Duck is marching with the army. For about the first five miles, he is enthusiastic. Every five miles, he begins to write the amount of miles on the soldier in front of him. As they march on, Donald's initial enthusiasm wears off, as he has to march through wind, rain, snow, and the beating sun. When the army stops, Donald attempts to set up his tent. It goes well at first, where he got his tent up. However, Donald could not resist twanging the tent strings, which he attempted to stop, but it collapsed. After many attempts, he gave up on the tent and tried to sleep. Donald tries to sleep, but there are too many noises. The bugler keeps trumpeting, the drummer's feet thump on his drum, and Donald manages finally to get some sleep-but only gets a few minutes right before dawn.
