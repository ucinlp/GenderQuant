Sofia is initially depressed, but decides to remix the voice-mail so that it sounds like Miguel telling her that he loves her and that he is sorry for leaving her and asking for forgiveness. Sofia then tells the remixed-voicemail that she will not take Miguel back. Lo que tú Quieras Oír Synopsis yifan_tunan; IMDB; Accessed 30-07-08
