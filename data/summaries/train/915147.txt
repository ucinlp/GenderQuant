The film is told through pansori, a traditional Korean form of storytelling that seeks to narrate through song. An earlier film by Im Kwon-taek, Sopyonje, also used pansori as a narrative tool. The film is based on Chunhyangga, a traditional Korean legend and is set in 18th century Korea. Two lovers, Mongryong and Chunhyang, the son of a nobleman governor and the daughter of a former courtesan, marry in secret. Ordered to Seoul to finish his education as a public servant, Mongryong leaves his bride behind but promises he will return. A new governor is appointed to the province and soon becomes attracted to Chunyang, making advances. Upholding her love for Mongryong, Chunhyang suffers imprisonment and torture in her commitment to her husband. Her only hope to be saved from death is the promise Mongryong made to return. In addition to the Romeo-and-Juliet-esque tale, Chunhyang sheds light on the realities of premodern Korea. Chunyang explores the harsh differences in living between the yangban  and non-yangban, and the realities of morally corrupt officials and yes-men functionaries.
