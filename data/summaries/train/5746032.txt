9mm Sunrise follows its lead character Jack Quick as he foils the plans of two battling gang lords who are attempting to start a gang war on the streets of Hollywood, California. As is apparent in all Scott Shaw films this film follows a non-linear storyline and presents images of Hollywood, California, including the Hollywood Sign and the Capital Records building. Several of the scenes for this film were shot on Hollywood Boulevard at night. This film also presents scenes filmed in Los Angeles Union Station. This railway hub was built in 1939 and is considered to be "The last of America's great rail stations.‚Äù It was created in an art deco style of architecture and is a very visual location that has been featured in many films and music videos. Union Station is also a commonly presented location in the films of Scott Shaw. This film is riddled with the unexpected characters, storyline twists and the music video style edits apparent in all Scott Shaw films. One character is a human rag doll that walks as if she has no bones. Also included in the characters of this film are a biker, a vampire, a prostitute, and several assassin characters. Shaw frequently references all of these characters in his films. This film is considered a "Zen Film" in that it was created in the distinct style of filmmaking formulated by Scott Shaw known as Zen Filmmaking. In this style of filmmaking no scripts are used.
