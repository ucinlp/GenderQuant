The plot concerns a gangster bird, who sings the title song and likes to prove his toughness by beating up on cops without provocation. The hoodlum spots the Birdville Bank across the street from the saloon where he hangs out, and calls his gang together to rob the bank and make a quick getaway. In the ensuing chase, the avian police  capture him by shooting the floor out from the birdhouse which he uses as his hideout, leaving him to sing "I'm Just a Jailbird Now" from his jail cell.
