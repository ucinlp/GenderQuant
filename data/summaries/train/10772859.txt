After his business partner leaves him penniless, Parvati's husband passes away, leaving behind two sons, Prabhakar , Sudhakar  and a dumb daughter Gauri , on the verge of destitution. When Prabhakar grows up, he marries Pooja  and moves out. Meanwhile, as time passes, Sudhakar grows up, completes his schooling, gets a job out of the town and relocates. When Gauri is not allowed to marry Murli , she commits suicide and so does Murli, calling for Sudhakar back home. Sudhakar marries wealthy Padma  and brings her home. Padma dislikes playing second fiddle even to Parvati leading to disagreements in the household. Padma's pregnancy too fails to resolve any of the problems. Thus the couple re-locates to Padma's palatial house in the city, leaving an ailing Parvati on her own. The rest of the film shows how Padma understands the value of family ties and brothers, Prabhakar and Sudhakar, get together to unite the family.
