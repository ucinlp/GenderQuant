Jimmy Grimble ([[Lewis McKenzie  is a 15-year-old misfit living in Manchester, where nothing seems to go his way. Jimmy is constantly threatened by the school bully, "Gorgeous" Gordon ; he is also not sure what to make of Johnny , a lost-in-the-ozone biker who is dating Donna , Jimmy's mum; and he has a crush on one of his classmates, Sara , who seems to like him, but his powers of speech invariably fail him when he tries to talk to her. Like most Mancunians, Jimmy loves football. He is a fervent supporter of Manchester City and attends home games with Donna's ex boyfriend, Harry . Jimmy also loves to play football, but while Eric , the coach of his school's team, thinks he has potential, "Gorgeous" is already a skilled player, and when Gordon's father informs the school he will make a large and much-needed donation if their team makes it to the Manchester Schools Cup final, it looks like Jimmy will be on the bench for a while. But when an old woman gives Jimmy a pair of boots that once belonged to one of City's greatest players, his skills on the field begin to change.
