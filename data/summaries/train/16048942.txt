The plot revolves around Dr. Moras  who visits a barber , who accidentally shaves Moras to look like a Chinese person , and then mistakenly cuts off Moras' rival's head , which is sewn back on by the barber's assistant , and ends with a sword fight - "The Duel" - and in which Faber is triumphant  and Ebinger and Faber embrace in a happy ending in a mysterious Senegalese Salon . The finale of Faber and Ebinger kissing  illustrates one of Brecht's first uses of the mock-romantic "happy ending" that would become a signature of Brecht's work throughout the years of the Weimar Republic.For a detailed account of the plot of the film, as well as its creation, see "A Brecht-Valentin Production: Mysteries of a Barbershop", W.
