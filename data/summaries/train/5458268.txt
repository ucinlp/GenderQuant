A traveling sideshow made up of a magician, a strongman, and an exotic dancer stop in rural villages hoping to mesmerize the townspeople out of whatever little money they may have. When a young accordionist becomes enamoured with the show's exotic dancer, he and his pregnant wife join the show as it sets off deeper into the interior.
