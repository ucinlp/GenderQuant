In 1900, lumberman Jim Fallon  greedily eyes the big trees in the virgin region of northern California. The land is already settled by, among others, a religious group led by Elder Bixby ([[Charles Meredith . Jim becomes infatuated with Bixby's daughter, Alicia , though that does not change his plan to cheat the homesteaders. When Jim's right-hand man, Yukon Burns  finds out, he changes sides and leads the locals in resisting Jim. Elder Bixby is killed when a big sequoia tree is chopped down by Jim's men and accidentally falls on his cabin. Jim's desperate attempt to rescue Alicia's father saves him from being convicted of murder. Meanwhile, timber rival Cleve Gregg  appears on the scene, making it a three-way fight. Gregg and his partner Frenchy LeCroix ([[John Archer  try to assassinate Jim, but end up killing Yukon instead. Jim has a dramatic change of heart and leads the settlers in defeating Gregg and Frenchy. Afterwards, Jim marries Alicia and settles down.
