Tim Burke, movie stuntman, is approached by a fellow named Denno Noonan with a peculiar offer. Noonan identifies himself as an employee of the eccentric millionaire Schuyler Tatlock, who moved to Hawaii and has not been seen in public for years. Schuyler is dead, Denno says, but he doesn't want the family to know that. Instead, he wants Burke to pretend to be Schuyler at a reading of the dead man's will. It will only take three days and Burke would be rewarded handsomely for his trouble. Burke dyes his hair and affects the voice and manner of the somewhat scatterbrained millionaire, best he can. Schuyler's younger sister Nan is among those fooled. The dead man's fortune is to be divided between the two children. But when it turns out that Schuyler is to be solely responsible until the 19-year-old Nan can turn 21, Burke is adamant that he won't continue this masquerade for two whole years. Trouble develops. Nicky Van Allen, a cousin, begins meddling in the family's affairs. Burke overhears a scheme for Nicky to marry Nan and get his hands on her money. And when he falls through a roof and is knocked unconscious, Burke wakes up speaking and acting in his normal way, confusing Nan until she decides that the blow has changed Schuyler's entire personality for the better. Nan is so fond of her brother now that her feelings can't be real. Everything changes, though, when Denno produces the actual Schuyler, who is very much alive. Burke and Nan are pleased to discover that they no longer need to behave like brother and sister.
