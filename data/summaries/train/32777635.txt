The film is set in Hoxton, East London and follows a young couple, George and Sophie. The premise of the film involves the pair saving money to go on their first holiday together. The deposit is paid, and they have two weeks left to pay the outstanding balance of Â£2,000. Sophie has entrusted George with her holiday savings, and is keen to settle the debt with the travel agents. The only trouble is, unbeknown to Sophie, George is flat broke. In a vain attempt to raise cash, George uses Sophie's holiday money to fund an ill judged drug deal, which goes horribly wrong, leaving the pair in fear of their lives.
