 The Stooges, while running the Cafe Casbah Bah  and attempting to prepare a meal for customers Hassan Ben Sober  and Ginna Rumma , discover a plan that their hungry customers are hatching. These two thieves are attempting to rob the tomb of King Rootintootin, which contains a priceless diamond, but they discover that the emir of Schmow  has already gotten his hands on the diamond. The two plotters start wailing and are thrown out of the restaurant. The Stooges then attempt to retrieve the diamond themselves, as there is a $50,000 reward at stake. The Stooges arrive at the emir's palace, all three dressed as Santa Claus. They then manage to acquire the diamond and make a quick exit, but not before dealing with a burly guard.
