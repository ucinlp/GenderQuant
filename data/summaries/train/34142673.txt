When the department store Santa Claus gets drunk before taking part in the Thanksgiving parade, Karen Walker , the parade director, fires him and must find a replacement immediately. She spots an old man ([[Sebastian Cabot  berating the inebriated Santa, and begs him to take over. He claims his name is Kris Kringle. Kris does so well during the parade that he is immediately hired to be the store's main Santa for the holiday period. All the children in New York begin to believe that he is the real Santa, with the exception of Karen's six-year-old daughter Susan . Karen's boyfriend, Bill Schafner ([[David Hartman , does his best to convince Susan to believe. While being babysat one night by Kris, Susan shares with him her Christmas wish, she would like a dad, a house, and a baby brother. Kris asks if she would begin to believe in Santa if she got all those things. Susan agrees that she would. Kris is credited with bringing in many more sales to the store than previous years, until one night, when he is arrested, then sanctioned for supposedly assaulting a man on the street. Later, the truth emerges, that the man he assaulted was the original drunk Santa, who set up Kris to be arrested, with the help of members of staff from a rival department store. The case ends up in court. It soon becomes clear that to get Kris acquitted and freed, Bill must prove that not only does Santa exist, but that Kris is the real one. It is a seemingly impossible task until Bill comes up with a plan that requires some help from Susan.
