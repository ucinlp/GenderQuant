The picture tells of two prison friends who cope with life outside jail after being paroled. Tito  and Castor  are two robbers whose failed scheme landed them in the Rosario prison for 30 years. Before being jailed, however, the duo stashed a whole lot of cash near the Paran√° River. They plan on getting back to it as soon as they're released. Thirty years later, however, their insecurities and the pressures of being re-adjusted to society, threaten to ruin their perfect crime.
