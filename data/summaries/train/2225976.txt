Con-artist Harry Bundage  believes that there is a great treasure at Candleshoe, the large country estate of Lady St Edmund . Harry recruits American Casey Brown —a street kid—into the plot, employing her to pose as Lady St Edmund's granddaughter, the Honourable Margaret, 4th Marchioness of St Edmond, who disappeared as a baby after her father died in a car crash. Lady St Edmund, however, is poor and owes money in back taxes. Priory , her butler , and some local orphan children help keep the estate finances one step ahead of the government by selling produce made on the estate. All of this happens unknown to Lady St Edmund. Initially Casey enters the con attempting to find the location of the treasure; but her affections gradually turn towards that of the household and Lady St Edmund. She eventually joins them in their quest to uncover Lady St Edmund's treasure for the benefit of Candleshoe, rather than for Bundage. This nearly costs the young girl her life when she is seriously injured trying to prevent Harry from stealing money from Lady St Edmund. Casey is taken to hospital unconscious with severe concussion and remains there for several days before she has recovered enough to return to Candleshoe and try to stop Bundage once and for all. The four clues revealed in the hunt for the treasure: *"For the sunrise student there is treasure among books." *"The paths of glory lead but to the grave."  *"He followed the eclipse for riches and fame; and, if ye would prosper, do ye the same." *"Underfoot, in the great hall. Look high, look low, discover all." Casey Brown's "open sesame" for Lady St. Edmund is a piece of music, "Greensleeves." Casey pretends to remember the tune when a music box is discovered hidden in the fireplace.
