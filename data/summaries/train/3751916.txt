The story is set deep in the Andhra Pradesh countryside, in the West Godavari. Swarnalata  is a classically trained Carnatic singer who lost her son and best friend in a bus accident. Swarnalata is still haunted by her loss, and keeps herself shut in her grand house for twenty years, too depressed to meet people or even sing. Eventually her dead friend's son Abhinay  returns to the village to open up barely healed wounds. Abhinay and his girlfriend Pinky  are both musicians, albeit with more modern tastes, and are itching to make it big. Abhinay knows of Swarnalata's skill in Carnatic music and wants her to sing with his band in a fusion piece, and after much persuasion Swarnalata agrees. The young couple slowly bond with Swarnalatha as they play together, and slowly their common wounds are put behind them. On the day of concert Swarnlata's husband books a taxi, which breaks down and they are forced to take the bus to city. Swarnalata gets traumatized and starts screaming with fear and faints. Abhinay and Pinky are devastated when Swarnlata fails to show up for the show, with the organizers kicking them out. Pinky decides to go back to the villageand finds Swarnalata frail and ill, filled with guilt of not showing up. She consoles her, while Swarnlata repeatedly apologises. Her helplessness irritates Pinky and she pushes Swarnalata in her car and drives across the bridge to show her that there is nothing to fear. Meanwhile in the city Abhinay has planned another concert, this time with only Pinky as main performer. Pinky starts singing and she is joined by Swarnalata on the stage. A side plot involving Pinky and her city slicker mother  add comedy into an otherwise serious and thoughtful film. The film was photographed by Rajiv Menon and edited by A. Sreekar Prasad. Music was composed by Mani Sharma.
