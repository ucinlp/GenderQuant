Set in Concord, Massachusetts during and after the American Civil War, the film is a series of vignettes focusing on the struggles and adventures of the four March sisters and their mother, affectionately known as Marmee , as they await the return of their father, who is fighting with the Union Army. Spirited tomboy Jo , who caters to the whims of their well-to-do Aunt March , dreams of becoming a famous author and writes plays for her sisters to perform for the local children. Amy  is pretty but selfish, Meg  works as a seamstress, and sensitive Beth  practices on her clavichord, an aging instrument sorely in need of tuning. The girls meet Laurie , who has come to live with his grandfather Mr. Laurence , the Marches' wealthy next-door neighbor. The Laurences invite them to a lavish party, where Meg meets Laurie's tutor, John Brooke . During the course of the next several months, Meg is courted by John, Jo has her first short story published, and Beth frequently takes advantage of Mr. Laurence's offer and practices on his piano. Marmee learns her husband has been wounded and is recuperating in a Washington, DC hospital, so she leaves home to care for him. During her absence, Beth contracts scarlet fever from a neighbor's baby. She recovers but is left in a weakened state. Her parents return, and Meg marries John. Laurie confesses his love to Jo, who rejects him. When he snubs her in return, Jo moves to a New York City boarding house to pursue her writing career. There she meets Professor Bhaer , an impoverished German linguist. With his help and encouragement, Jo improves her writing and resolves her confused feelings about Laurie. A debilitated Beth nears death, and Jo returns to Concord. After her sister dies, Jo learns that Amy, who accompanied Aunt March to Europe, has fallen in love with Laurie. Jo then accepts the proposal of marriage offered by the professor, and Amy and Laurie eventually wed as well.
