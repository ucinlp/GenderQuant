Led by Denise , the dumb blonde that isn't as dumb as you think, a party of holiday-makers, all of them, except one, women, become lost in an island jungle and stalked by a deranged tribe of murderous natives. A feminist , a mother , her daughter  and a swinging smooth operator  round out the other endangered tourists.
