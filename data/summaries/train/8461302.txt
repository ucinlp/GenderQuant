The Stooges are furniture makers hired to duplicate a priceless antique Chinese cabinet on loan for a $50,000 bond from a local museum to a Mr. Morgan . Once the inept Stooges set to work, the valuable cabinet is quickly smashed to pieces, and the trio barely escape from the enraged Morgan. While on the run, the boys learn that they have inherited a fancy dress boutique, the "Madame de France," from their recently deceased Uncle Pete. They enter the fashion business, designing women's fashions which resemble the furniture they built. They are hired to put on a fashion show by a woman who turns out to be Morgan's wife, Mrs. Morgan Morgan . When Mr. Morgan arrives, he recognizes the Stooges as the vandals who destroyed his cabinet, and pummels Curly vigorously. Moe throws a pastry but misses his target and hits one of the fashion show guests; more cream puffs are hurled and soon the entire room is engaged in a free-for-all. The fight ends when three women knock the Stooges unconscious with mannequin legs.
