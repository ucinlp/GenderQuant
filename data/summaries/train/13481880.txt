Karl Guenther  is a conscientious landlord who looks out for his young and attractive tenants. Jessica , the rising young soap opera star, Harriet , a sensuous and vivacious secretary, Sophie , an accomplished pianist who enjoys wild affairs with her boyfriend, and Lori , a young college student who has just moved in a recently "vacated" apartment: all live in Karl's well kept apartments. The only discord is the "tap, tap, tap" sound at night from the crawlspace above their rooms. Karl tells them it's only rats, but in reality it is Karl spying on them. One by one, the tenants , become his victims ...each one put to a gruesome test. Only Lori remains alive to disclose the diabolical Karl and she enters the crawlspaceâ€”she is alone with a madman capable of anything.
