 The film features interviews with sex reassignment surgeon Dr. Leo Wollman and various transsexuals. Between the interviews, there are re-enactments or dramatizations of the interviewees' experiences, such as one woman who didn't wait long enough after surgery before she took a man home, and her new vagina started to bleed because it hadn't been given enough time to heal after the surgery. The film was released on DVD in 2006.
