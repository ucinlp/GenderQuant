The home includes their elder daughter-in-law, a widow, raising two little boys. Their middle son is Kailash  married to a very devoted, loving woman. Their youngest son is Kamal , a college student, who falls in love with another student Usha Gupta . The young married daughter, who was living with her husband and father-in-law, has now moved back home using a trivial reason, such as how she doesn't like her father-in-law's singing. Her husband followed her and is staying in the household, trying his best to get his wife to come back to his home. Her mother has spoiled her completely. One day, the daughter plants a suspicion in her brother Kailash's head that his wife is having an affair with Kamal. Even after Kamal's marriage to Usha, Kailash's suspicions grow to the point where he leaves his wife and attempts suicide. His friend, a respectable dancer named Ragini, stops him. He accepts her help and later pursues her romantically, but she sees him only as a friend as he is a married man. One day, Kamal sees his mother about to hit his wife Usha and stops her. He also convinces his father to tame his mother and take control of the household, which he finally does. The father forces his daughter to leave with her husband back to her in-laws. When Kailash's wife tells him that she is pregnant, he rejects the notion that he is the father, claiming that Kamal fathered the child. The wife vehemently denies these allegations. Heartbroken, she attempts suicide but is stopped by members of the family. The sister is forced to tell the truth about how she fabricated the story about Kamal having an affair with his sister-in-law. Kailash now believes in his wife's fidelity and devotion and begs for her forgiveness. She forgives him, and the entire family is now reunited and happy.
