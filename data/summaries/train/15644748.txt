Former New Orleans cop Jack Robideaux  arrives with his pet rabbit in Columbus, New Mexico to take a job with the border patrol, working for Captain Ramona Garcia . At the moment, the border patrol is up against a highly dangerous drug smuggling operation, in which the smugglers are funneling illegal immigrants and bricks of heroin through the porous defenses of the Mexico/U.S. border. Migrants are randomly outfitted with C4 vests, so any border patrol agent who interferes might get blown up. As it turns out, the smugglers are a rogue special forces unit led by Benjamin Meyers  and his right hand man Karp , who have taken over all of the smuggling operations in the area by killing major drug kingpins Felix Nestor  and Benito Ortiz . Jack and his partner Billy Pawnell ([[Gary McDonald  have their work cut out for them in trying to bring down Meyers and his operation. When Myers and his men take over and rig a missionary bus to smuggle drugs, Jack and Billy pursue them across the border, out of their jurisdiction, and Jack is captured by the local police, who are working for Meyers. Once Jack is taken from a Mexican jail to Meyers's compound, it turns out that Billy is working for Meyers, who has also kidnapped Ramona and her uncle Emile . Meyers kills Emile by throwing him into a pool of water charged by live wires. It turns out that Jack has a personal reason for going after Meyers -- Meyers's drugs killed Jack's daughter Kassie  about three months ago, when Kassie was barely 16 years old. Jack's pet rabbit was Kassie's rabbit, and he carries it around in memory of Kassie. He also swore on her grave to take down whatever drug operation he could find. Jack and Ramona manage to free themselves and kill Billy. Ramona calls for help from Mexican police, and she and Jack start fighting their way through Meyers's men. Ramona goes to find an escape vehicle but is knocked out in a car crash. Jack is confronted by Karp, who is a martial arts expert. They fight, and Jack beats Karp to death. Meyers, whose potential investors have abandoned him, confronts Jack and is about to shoot him when Jack throws an explosive collar toward Meyers and detonates it. Later on, Ramona advises Jack to go back to New Orleans and be with his wife.
