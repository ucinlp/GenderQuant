The cartoon depicts a tribe of cartoon mice who move and dance through a room filled with musical instruments, while the song It's Got Me Again! plays on a gramophone. When a hungry cat shows up and tries to eat the mice, most of them escapeâ€”but one mouse is trapped. Luckily, he is rescued by the others, who turn their musical instruments as weapons against the cat.
