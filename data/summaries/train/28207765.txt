Bimbo the garbage man walks the streets asking townsfolk "Any Rags?". He comes across Betty Boop who throws her garbage to him from her window. Bimbo then auctions all the garbage he has collected from his cart to a crowd which includes Koko the Clown, who purchases a bowtie. When Bimbo opens Betty's garbage bag, Betty Boop leaps out and kisses Bimbo. The cart then rolls down the hill and turns into a home for Betty and Bimbo.
