The film starts with a brief introduction to the work of Thomas A. Edison and a clip from William K.L. Dickson's Dickson Experimental Sound Film . Douglas Shearer then presents a behind the scenes look at the filming of W.S. Van Dyke's Bitter Sweet  featuring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy to explain how the sound is recorded. A scene from King Vidor's Comrade X  featuring Clark Gable and Hedy Lamarr is used to demonstrate the final result. The film concludes with a montage from trailers for coming MGM pictures and a Technicolor screen test of Greer Garson for Mervyn LeRoy's Blossoms in the Dust .
