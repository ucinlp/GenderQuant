A team from the Canary Island NGO, Nimba, travels through Conakry, Guinea, screening the documentary Europa: ¿paraíso o espejismo?  in which five Sub-Saharan immigrants recount their experiences as they traveled from Africa to the coast of the Canary Islands. People from different social groups talk about the country's situation, what leads people to leave and the possible solutions to a conflict that, unfortunately, is very in force.
