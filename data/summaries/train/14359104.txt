At the age of 40, Wiktor Ruben  returns to the family property  where he'd spent his late teens/early twenties as a tutor of young sisters. Now they are all women - mostly wives and mothers. Wiktor discovers that Fela, once the closest to him, is now dead for some time and other sisters aren't too keen to talk about her and her grave is rather forgotten. He is also disappointed with how all the women have changed. Julia , now a mother of two, doesn't resemble his first object of love and desire she once was and doesn't show him an affection he might expected. Jola , seemingly unhappy in her marriage, chases him and makes fun of it, until he doesn't bring the painful memories of the past. Kazia , a divorcee - thus treated like less worthy than others - is the most demanding partner of his intellectual reflections while Zosia  is - as always - distant and outspoken. That leaves him with Tunia  who was only a child when he previously knew her but now resembles Fela. Wiktor spends time in Wilko but isn't able to see that his return restored once forgotten dreams and hopes of the sisters...
