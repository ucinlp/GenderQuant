Jonathan "Jon" Cold  is a former "foreigner," or deep cover operative, who now works as a freelance agent who is frequently commissioned to deliver high-risk packages. As Jon prepares for his father's funeral, Alexander Marquet  asks him to take on an assignment. Jon is keen to leave the business, but he reluctantly accepts the job. His task is to take a mysterious package from France to a wealthy man in Germany. But Jon will soon find that there are a lot of people who are determined to prevent him from doing so. Jon is accompanied by Dunoir  to a farmhouse to pick up the package, and they are attacked by assassins. Jon fights them off and decides to continue with the assignment. Leaving Dunoir behind in France, Jon heads for his father Jackson's memorial service in Warsaw, Poland, and Jon meets up with his brother Sean  before continuing on to Germany. The package turns out to contain a black box flight recorder from an aircraft that had been suspiciously downed, and the recipient -- sinister industrialist Jerome Van Aken  -- has a vested interest in it. Once he arrives in Germany, Jon discovers that he is being pursued by various agents and assassins, while Van Aken's wife Meredith  and CIA spook Jared Olyphant  also seem to want to get hold of the package.
