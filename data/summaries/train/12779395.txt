Young Sicilian worker, Antonio Spagara, has been assigned by the Mafia to murder a nobleman, Marquis Macri. But at the last minute Antonio pulls out and instead of killing the father, he flees to Palermo with Grazia, his daughter. Life there in the city is difficult, as the young man must confront his father and his despotic sister Dorotea. The Mafia also is not going to tolerate Antonio's desertion.
