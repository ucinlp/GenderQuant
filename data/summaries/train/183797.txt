In a hospital, Angie Evans, her face bandaged, recounts the events that brought her here. A nightclub singer, Angie becomes involved with another singer, Ken Conway, whose career has yet to take off. Her agent Mike Dawson helps get Ken and piano accompanist Steve Anderson a spot on a radio show singing cowboy songs. Ken sings a ballad on the day Angie, now his wife, gives birth to their daughter. The attention he gets leads to a new career opportunity. Ken soon is a big success, gaining popularity and wealth, while Angie stays home, her career at a standstill. She begins to drink. Ken counts on her to present a sophisticated image for his new high-society friends and contacts, but her alcoholism worsens, so secretary Martha Gray comes to Ken's aid. It isn't long before Angie is certain an affair has begun with Martha and her husband. Steve tries to intervene on Angie's behalf, but he can see Martha has fallen in love with Ken. Angie neglects the child, continues to drink, then creates a scene at a party. Ken asks for a divorce and custody. A fire from a lit cigarette of hers, shortly after she kidnaps their daughter from a nurse, results in Angie's suffering serious facial burns while saving the child. There may be no hope, but Ken tries to stand by his wife as her life hits rock bottom.
