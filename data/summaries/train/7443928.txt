Doing Time on Maple Drive centers on the Carter family. Father Phil  is a successful local restaurateur, married for many years to Lisa . They have three grown children, Karen , Tim  and Matt . Karen is married to Tom , Tim works in his father's restaurant and Matt is a college student. Matt returns from college and introduces the family to his fianc√©e, Allison . Matt is injured after crashing his car; he returns home to recuperate. As he recovers, the family is revealed to be almost completely dysfunctional. Tim is an alcoholic. Matt's car crash was a suicide attempt brought on by the pressure of being gay and closeted from his conservative parents and lying about Allison's breaking their engagement because of it. Lisa is in deep denial about all of the problems family members are facing. Karen's husband Tom learns that Karen is pregnant and that she is so terrified of bringing a child into a family situation like hers that she's considering having an abortion without telling him. Tom angrily confronts her father Phil, declaring that while Phil may be destroying his own family he won't allow Phil to destroy his. He takes Karen away. Matt confronts his parents, including telling his mother that he knows she already knows he is gay after having walked in on him and another boy. Lisa continues to struggle with denial, but Phil begins to take tentative steps toward understanding.
