 Zapa  is a locksmith apprentice living the simple life in Corrientes with his family. After the locksmith Polaco  pulls a job on a safe and uses him as a scapegoat, Zapa is made to pay for the crime by serving in the Buenos Aires police jail, which is pictured as notoriously corrupt. This takes him to the La Matanza barrio in Greater Buenos Aires. Here, Zapa is taken in as the proteg√© of his superior Gallo  and begins to climb the ladder of corruption. At the same time he has an affair with instructor Mabel . His journey through the political underworld as he frames and bribes ultimately takes him to the edge of innocence, and a final confrontation with El Polaco. {{space}}
