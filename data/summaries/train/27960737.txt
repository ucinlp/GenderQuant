Betty Boop's tomboyish young cousin, Buzzy, takes the train to visit Betty. While riding the train, she's "helpful" to other passengers in a mischievous kind of way, using her chewing gum to stick on a sleeping man's toupee, and watering the flowers in a lady's hat. At Betty's house Buzzy meets up with a bunch of rough boys next door playing marbles and tries to join in. She proves better than the boys at tricks like balancing on a fence, and even fares well when the boys unleash a goat to fight with her. Only then is she considered "one of the guys!"
