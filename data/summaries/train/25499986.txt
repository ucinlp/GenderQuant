It should be a relaxing weekend in a remote cabin in the woods, as far away from big city bustle and the usual routine. But for the group of young people who wanted to meet here for camping, there is different. When they find a mysterious game and play it despite every warning, they unknowingly invoke three hideous ghosts; witches who only have one thing in mind: the death of the group. Only when it is possible to solve the various mysteries in time, can they hope to escape the clutches of the evil they have awoken and, for the parties, it's a merciless race of death against life.Ghost Game Review | GruselSeite.com
