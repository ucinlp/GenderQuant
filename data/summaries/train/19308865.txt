Floreal is released from prison prior to the end of a military coup d'Ã©tat in 1983. He discovers his wife has cheated on him and is not sure he wants to return to his former life and family. A friend, "El-Negro", who was killed during the miliary coup, appears in the night with a special mission: to help Floreal face what has happened when he was serving time in prison. El-Negro helps him to live through the important events that happened in his absence. El-Negro helps him get past his anger, understanding how hard it was to endure such a difficult time and how the military coup had crushed people's lives. When El-Negro finally tells him he must return, Floreal realizes he must be strong and, like his coup-stricken country, pick up and go on with his life.
