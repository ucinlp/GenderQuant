Catherine and Duoâ€™s relationship that begins as a satirical inversion of the Hollywood Romantic Comedy paradigm comes to an abrupt Anglican halt when half of the couple leaves to study at Oxford University. Left behind like so many zealots before him, Duo finds a somewhat psychotic comfort in shipping everything he owns to himself. Somewhere between "point A" and "point A", however the parcels, of course, get lost. This is where Travis finds Duo, on the floor of an apartment as stripped as its tenet and, perhaps, as desperate. Travis and a band of well-meaning compatriots try their best to pick up the sad, silly pieces of their once self-possessed friend and, eventually, lead Duo back to the path of the essentially sane. Unfortunately and inevitably, just as Duo retrieves some measure of direction Catherine returns tossing him back into uncompromising melancholy. Somehow, though, her homecoming also carries illuminations of exactly what love means for at least one member of a seemingly wayward generation.
