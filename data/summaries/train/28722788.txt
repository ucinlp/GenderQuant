The Bollywood classic is a farcical comedy about the vicissitudes of modern love. Mohan , Pradeep , and Ranjeet  are three struggling artists—singer, painter, and writer, respectively—who live together in the same rooming house. Romantic hijinks ensue when the trio meet three lovely girls, Geeta , Rekha , and Kalpana , with very specific ideas about art and love.yahoo movies citehttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0157524/plotsummary
