Paul van Riebeck travels to Ireland from his native South Africa in 1847 to buy horses for his commandos back home, who need them to fight Zulu tribal warriors. He meets lovely Katie O'Neill, daughter of the man selling the horses. She falls in love, but Paul feels he must return home alone. Squire O'Neill dies and a potato famine cripples the Irish people financially. Katie decides to marry Shawn Kildare and persuades him to move to South Africa, a place Paul has told her much about. They have a son before arriving in Cape Town, where an 800-mile trek to Hoffen Valley awaits them. Commando leader Kurt Hout guides the wagon train and becomes fixated on Katie after the Zulu kill her husband. Paul and his other men save the settlers, and he ends up in a brutal fight against Kurt with whips. Kurt stays behind to help Katie build and run a farm because Paul is called away to lead his men. Kurt tries to force himself on her during a storm. A tree falls, resulting in the amputation of one of his legs. The impoverished Katie is brought a valuable diamond by a native, so she and her son return to Cape Town to buy Paul's ancestral home. She loses both her fortune and her husband, who is not pleased by the turn of events. Kurt, meantime, has become leader of a band of outlaws, and his one remaining desire is to kill Paul.
