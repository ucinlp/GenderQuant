The Stooges return home to their shack in the city dump to find it inhabited by a young woman and her crippled younger brother, Jimmy. Taking pity on the boy, the trio decide to help raise the $500 needed for a leg operation for the boy. They immediately find a can full of money , which turns out to be the $62 the boy and his sister have already saved for the operation. Two confidence men  cheat the Stooges out of the $62 and their car for a map they claim will lead to a treasure. Following the map, the Stooges drill into the United States Treasury, where they are arrested. The Stooges end up meeting President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who has learned of Jimmy's plight. The President then pardons the Stooges and pays for Jimmy's operation.
