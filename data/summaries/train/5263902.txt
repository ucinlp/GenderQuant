He is actually an outlaw leader who attacks both sides in the Civil War for his own profit. After capturing a wagon loaded with Confederate uniforms, he decides to pass himself off as a Confederate officer. Her naive, idealistic brother Fletcher  joins what he believes is a Rebel guerrilla force. Meanwhile, Cantrell's stern, but loved mother  refuses to accept any of her son's ill-gotten loot. A former suitor of Mary's, Union supporter Bob Seton , is captured by Cantrell and scheduled for execution. After being rescued by a disillusioned Fletcher McCloud, Seton and Mary Cantrell race to the town of Lawrence  to warn the residents of an impending attack by Cantrell's gang.
