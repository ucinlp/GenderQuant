One Day in Europe consists of four stories about communication misunderstanding which take place on a single day in four different cities . The Champions League match between Galatasaray and Deportivo La Coru√±a which takes place in Moscow on that particular day only worsens the problem. The movie shows how four different tourists in four different places interact with the local police after being actually robbed or staging a robbery the intent mainly to collect a police report to be used to claim insurance. The football match actually plays a silent role in the movie showing how the policemen are engrossed in the game and care little for the loss of the tourist.
