Driven to investigate the unexplained disappearance of his father, New York psychologist Ed Hunter  travels to a remote village in the west of Ireland and finds a community that has been living in fear for centuries. He meets a mysterious girl  who tells him that his father had been searching for the spirits of a mother and child who were buried alive in the nearby forest over 1000 years ago because his ancestors had killed them and his father wanted to pay the debt. His father's friend, the local parish priest  holds all the answers but has locked himself in his church for fear of his life. Later the priest tells Ed that his father had taken a skull from the place where the mother and child were buried alive and that the spirits want it back. Ed decides to return it with the help of priest. When he enter the chambers and places the skull back, he finds a dead body of the real priest and realizes the man posing as priest is his real father. He realizes that his father has trapped him in the chambers alive just like the mother and son to pay the debt. Later his dad is also killed by the spirits. Last scene shows that Ed's girlfriend is pregnant and spirit is watching over.
