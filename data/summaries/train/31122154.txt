High society woman Muriel Allen  wants to attend a swanky dinner party thrown by friend Alice Preston  but husband Arthur ([[Charles Williams  decides instead to go on a fishing trip. Rather than showing up stag to the party, Muriel tells housekeeper Petunia  to call the Acme Escort Service to bring a few "college boy" escorts. However, Petunia accidentally calls the Acme Exterminator Co., run by Shemp and Tom. At the mansion, the duo are assumed to be cultured old college seniors. Guest of honor Lord Wafflebottom  follows the pest exterminators' lead in proper American party manners, turning the dinner party into an uncouth display. When mice are conveniently spotted, the boys go to work, disrupting the party and the entire mansion.
