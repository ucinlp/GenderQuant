Based on the "Molly: An American Girl" book series, this movie is set in 1944 in the town of Jefferson, Illinois. Molly McIntire and her family are learning to cope with the changes the war has brought to their close-knit family. The start somewhat centers around Molly missing her father who is overseas to care for wounded soldiers in England. As they try to keep things running smoothly, Molly enters a dance contest at school, and is picked for the role of "Miss Victory". She and her friends, Susan Shapiro and Linda Rinaldi, are lively, outgoing, and always bursting with ideas. Also during this time, a young girl named Emily Bennett comes from London, England to live with the McIntire family. At first, Molly is unhappy about Emily staying at her home because she thinks she is rich and stuck-up. Then Molly learns Emily's true story, and her feelings toward her change for the better. At the end of the film, Molly learns the importance of getting along and pulling together no matter what.
