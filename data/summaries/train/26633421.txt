Seamus Kelly is a sociology student from Cork who, as part of his final year in college, directs a documentary on subcultures in suburbia, eventually coming to focus on the Cork hip-hop scene and local artist Grandmaster Cash in particular. The documentary follows Cash as he struggles to achieve fame and fortune, amidst the trouble of negative critical reception and dealing with the rival hip-hop crew, led by Dr Feekinstein.
