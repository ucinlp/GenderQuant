A young man  joins a traveling show with his uncle. He is lured into the majestic, mysterious quality of the magic show and is soon an important fixture at conjuring acts and disappearing acts. During the course of the seven episodes , Firth's character, young Richard Herncastle, sees the "whole wide world" from backstage at the music hall variety shows with which the magic act travels, just as his uncle Nick  has promised--hilarity, beauty, love, lust, fear, despair. Richard comes of age just as the world enters the fateful year of 1914--the outbreak of World War I, when the greatest of all disappearing acts becomes imminent: the disappearance of millions. The series has the second to last appearance of Olivier as a fading comedian named Harry Burrard, who has long since lost his audience and his comic abilities. Harry should have retired years before, however he has nowhere else to go and his brain is collapsing into paranoia. The role is a sort of older version of Olivier's Archie Rice, from The Entertainer .
