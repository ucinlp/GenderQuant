Constance is a young French woman who is dissatisfied with her mundane life, but has a talent for reading stories to others. As the movie opens, she happens to be reading a book called La Lectrice to her boyfriend, in which the main character, a woman named Marie, reads literature to others for a living. She becomes engrossed in the book to the point that she begins imagining herself as Marie: both Constance and Marie are played by Miou-Miou, and the movie weaves back and forth between the stories of Marie and Constance. Marie embarks on her new profession with gusto. As she reads to her clients, all of whom are seeking a little more than the solace of literature, she works a fantastical transformation on them. Her clients include the widow of a Marxist general , a nervous businessman , a retired magistrate, and a handicapped teenage boy, and soon the clients' friends and families become involved as well, as does her professor ([[Christian Blanc . The general's widow's maidservant and the boy's friends from school all become affected by the readings, and Constance has an affair with the businessman. Books read include The Lover , and the works of Marquis de Sade .
