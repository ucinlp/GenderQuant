A girl named Alice is stuck while solving a difficult crossword puzzle when her cat Julius tells her they should go to the beach. They swim in the ocean for a while then dry off and Alice continues her puzzle. Just as she begins, Pete  demands she gives him her puzzle. Alice refuses and smacks him in the face. She then runs into a light house and locks the door. Pete breaks down the door and chases Alice around the light house. Alice screams for help and Julius hears her. He climbs to the top and a fight breaks out. Julius wins the fight by knocking Pete off the light house. Alice then discovers the last phrase in her puzzle, "The End."
