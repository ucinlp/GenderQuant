Directorâ€™s statement<ref nameHanyut/Almayer's Folly  ~ Bissme vs. U-Wei| urlAjami Hashim |accessdateBissme| locationEnglish|date  Hanyut is a story about a cosmopolitan society living and working together along a riverbank somewhere in Malaysia. It attracted many sea travelers seeking opportunity and rewards.  It gives us a window into the Malay society in Malaysia in the late 19th century: A highly competitive mix of indigenous Malays, tribal aborigines, Europeans, Arabs, Indians and Chinese living and working together.  Although the book starts out as though it is from the perspective of the European protagonist, the narrative is dynamic. By the end of the story the protagonist  discover the understanding of his own insignificance.  In the beginning of the story Almayer appears to be at the center of society, but in the end we see that he is very much peripheral and alienated, and that the real cultural, political and economic life of the community is located elsewhere and involves other people besides himself.
