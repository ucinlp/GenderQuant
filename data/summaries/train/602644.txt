The film features Daffy Duck in the role of legendary outlaw Robin Hood, and opens to the strains of his playing a song on an instrument similar to an archlute or bouzouki. As he prances along singing, he trips and tumbles down a hill, off a bank and into a lake. Watching is Porky Pig, as a Friar Tuck figure, who laughs uproariously at Daffy's inglorious plunge. The annoyed Daffy tries to prove his skill with a quarterstaff but manages to hit himself in the face with it, bending his bill in what becomes a recurring visual gag throughout the film. Undeterred, Daffy tries again, but while he is spinning his quarterstaff, Porky stops it with a wooden dowel, resulting in Daffy himself spinning around and falling back into the lake.  Having given up trying to impress the friar, Daffy attempts to leave, but Porky follows and asks him if he knows the whereabouts of Robin Hood's hideout as he wants to join his band of jolly outlaws. Daffy proudly announces that he is Robin Hood, but Porky disbelieves him. In order to prove that he is Robin Hood, Daffy informs Porky that he will attempt to rob a rich traveler on a bouncing mule and give his money "to some poor unworthy slob". Daffy pitifully fails in each and every attempt he makes to stop the traveler, usually injuring himself in the process, be it accidentally firing himself from his own bow, or slamming into a succession of trees while trying to swing on a rope , and after chopping the trees down to clear a path, his next attempt results in him slamming face-first into a rock. Eventually the rich traveler, oblivious to Daffy's increasingly desperate attempts to rob him, reaches his castle unharmed. The frustrated Daffy finally gives up, and in the final scene walks on with a tonsured head and wearing a habit, having decided to become a friar himself, he tells Porky; "Shake hands with Friar Duck!" As the film closes, Daffy's bill bends back up one more time.
