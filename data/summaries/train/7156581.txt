The summer of their senior year, eight best friends rent a beach house for one last week before separating for college. Still Green follows each character through the three days in the house surrounding the unexpected death of one of the friends. The plot unfolds as their personal stories interweave, overlap, and often directly conflict with one another. Their stories represent the many milestones in the transition from high school to young adult life, from Monica's first night skinny dip to the morning Sean beats the hell out of his best friend, to Alan's break up with his first real girlfriend. It's a story of secret crushes, crippling insecurities, excitement over a boundless future, discovering nature, and crossing the line between friendship and sexual attraction. But a darker inescapable theme drives the plot of Still Green; how death changes absolutely everything between a group of friends, at a time when every second of life seemed vitally important and every emotion felt like the end of the world.Still Green  - Plot summary
