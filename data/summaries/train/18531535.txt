Geir likes to live dangerously, while Stig Inge is a more cautious and uncertain type. Kristoffer and Geir work as billboard hangers, and in his spare time Kristoffer makes a video diary with Geir and Stig Inge, containing stunts of a Jackass-nature. When Kristoffer's girlfriend, Elisabeth, leaves him, his life seems to fall to pieces. Then his videos are featured on Norway's most popular talk show, "God morgen Norge" on TV 2, and Kristoffer becomes famous.
