John Conroy, a crusading district attorney, is tasked to crack down on a crime syndicate, which proves more dangerous because the mob has many city officials under their control. He's assisted by a newspaper man, Jerry McKibbon, who doesn't think Conroy is tough enough to handle this almost impossible assignment. McKibbon finds his efforts are also compromised by political corruption. McKibbon is eventually shot down by an out-of-town assassin who was hired to kill him at a boxing match. The film is not related to the 1977 ballet drama The Turning Point.
