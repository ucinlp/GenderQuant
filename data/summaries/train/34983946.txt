The story takes place in Burkina Faso. Poverty grows with each year that passes at Gourga, a village on the borders of the Sahel. The inhabitants must choose: either wait for international assistance to arrive or travel to a richer area of the country. Salam, a peasant, and his family opt for the second solution despite the sacrifices that this entails. They begin a new life and they rediscover what hunger had made them forget: love, joy, hate and violence.
