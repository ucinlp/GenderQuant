Anil Kumar "Sona"  sees a young woman named Roopa jumping from the third floor of the hotel at night where he regularly performs as a musician under the stage name "Rocky." Roopa's younger sister, Sunita,  believes that her sister committed suicide because of a supposedly ruined affair with Rocky, so she comes to seek vengeance. She and Anil fall in love, but he doesn't know how to tell her that he and Rocky are the same person. Anil takes the help of a rich older man who pretends to be Anil's uncle to help Anil impress Sunita and her father. A police detective reveals that Roopa didn't commit suicide but was actually pushed from the third floor with an expensive shirt button in her clenched hand. Is the killer Roopa's jealous fiancee Ramesh, who now has plans for Sunita? Or is it the dancer Ruby who is pining for Rocky? Or was it because Roopa witnessed something?
