A cop  is suspected of killing a gorgeous film star. Since he was extremely drunk at the time, even he suspects that he did it. The investigation leads him to Candy, an artist's mistress , as well as to a slimy Laura-type gossip columnist  who spent time with the woman that night and becomes the main suspect. But he also becomes a red herring when a third man is finally found to be the real killer.
