Main Anna Nahin Hoon explores the dilemma of a common man in India, wherein he often finds himself caught between corruption and honesty. There is a character in the film whose personality has been modeled on social activist Anna Hazare. The film's message is that while it has become fashionable in India to support Anna Hazare's stand against corruption, how many of us are actually honest? The film takes a deeper look into the practical impossibility of living an honest life in India. The film has been written and directed by writer-director Manish Gupta known for writing 'Sarkar' and directing 'The Stoneman Murders' and 'Hostel'.
