Georgian bush pilot Mimino  works at small local airlines, flying helicopters between small villages. But he dreams of piloting large international airlines aircraft, so he decides to go to Moscow to follow his dream. There in a hotel he meets Armenian truck driver Roobik Khachikyan  who is given a place in that hotel by mistake instead of another Khachikyan , and they have a lot of adventures in Moscow.   Always amicable and open to people, Mimino does not feel at home in the big city. Nevertheless, he becomes a pilot of a supersonic jet liner, the Tupolev Tu-144, flying all over the world. But feeling homesick, he finally comes back to his native town of Telavi in Georgia, to his family and friends. Mimino's real name in the film is Valiko Mizandari - his nickname 'Mimino'  is the Georgian word for sparrow hawk, although it is stated on the back cover of the DVD that 'Mimino' means falcon. Either way, it seems that this nickname is to equate to some kind of bird of prey, which is perhaps fitting for a pilot.
