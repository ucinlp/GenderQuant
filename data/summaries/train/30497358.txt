Cheers, to Those Who Stay revolves around Kyle, a Lebanese expatriate living in Detroit and studying filmmaking there. Kyle returns to Lebanon to deal with what he describes as a director's block and to get film material for his project. Kyle stays at his cousins flat where he meets his relatives: Omar a wannabe actor who is stuck in a clerical job; Maissa a controlling character who is always right; Alex a lazybone and speedster; Joana the underdog obsessed with cleanliness and Ziad the hopeless romantic. Through his cousins Kyle experiences Lebanese everyday people, their problems, joie de vivre and complaints about the life in Beirut.<ref name |dateCheers, To Those Who Stay - Chapter 1: Beirut, 20 Years Later|url62y8CyKMUFs |formatMotion picture|languageOrange Dog Productions |location |archivedate2010-01-16 |time |isbn |quote }}
