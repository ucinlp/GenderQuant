The film follows the plot of Journey's End quite closely, {{Or}} albeit set in the RFC rather than in an infantry battalion. The film is set in a one-week timeframe. It opens with fighter ace Major Gresham  speaking to a class of students at Eton school in October 1916. One year later, a single new recruit shows up at Gresham's base, 2nd Lt. Croft . At Eton, Gresham was his house captain. Moreover, Croft is the younger brother of his girlfriend. Gresham already relies on alcohol to cope with combat stress and bring himself to continue flying. Now the strain of being responsible for this young recruit  is an additional burden. Croft has to learn how to survive not only in the air, but on the ground as well as he initially makes some minor mistakes in squadron etiquette. The film also follows Croft's rapid rite of passage from naive schoolboy to adult fighting soldier. We also see Croft's initial hero worship of his commanding officer crumble as he learns the realities of active service, yet regains a new respect for Gresham and the stresses he has to cope with. The film reaches its tragic conclusion when Croft finally scores his first air victory and seems to have made the leap in skills necessary to survive, but is suddenly killed in a collision with a German aircraft.
