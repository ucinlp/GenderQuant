Ben-Hur Ova , who has a loving and devoted wife, Miassis , is voted the "World's Most Faithful Husband" by Ladies House Companion magazine. Lucifer U. Devil  is upset because there have not been enough new souls in Hell. The last "major" arrival was Adolf Hitler. Lucifer is challenged by the claim that no earthly temptation can lure Ben away from Miassis. He bets his wife, Saturna , who has been badgering him to get back on duty, that he can get Ben to forsake his faithfulness. "I’ll have him cheating on his wife within two shakes of a sinner’s tail," he vows. He visits the couple in order to tempt Ben with a succession of buxom, naked young women. There is a scene in a backyard swimming pool with a sexy bathing beauty; another scene in the same pool has two beauties; and there is a peek at the new maid. None of his ploys work, however. Lucifer then escorts Ben for a night out on the town, treating him to cocktails, barmaids, a burlesque show, a Turkish bath, a hotel room, and a special TV commercial during Ben's favorite program, The Wonderful World of Disney. As it turns out, Ben-Hur Ova is actually a visiting Arabian sheik with a large harem of wives and Lucifer's efforts to tempt him with beautiful, sexy women is to no avail.
