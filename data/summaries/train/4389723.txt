Frankie, Dee Dee, and the beach party gang hit Malibu Beach for another summer of surfing and no jobs only to find their secret surfing spot threatened by a gang of bodybuilders, led by the dim-witted coach Jack Fanny . All the while, a bored Italian Countess  is trying to steal Frankie from Dee Dee and, much to everyone's surprise, he seems more than happy to go along with it. She's going to turn him into a teen idol, not unlike Frankie Avalon's real-life persona. Fortunately, due to some razzing from his former surfing buddies and sage advice from Buddy Hackett, Frankie sees the error of his ways and goes back to his American beach bunny, Dee Dee.
