The finer points of the film's plot are somewhat unclear, as differing sources offer conflicting detail. The main thrust however is that the wife of a wealthy barrister is seduced by her chauffeur, with whom she falls in love. She gives birth to a baby, apparently without her husband knowing anything her pregnancy. It is not clear exactly what arrangements are made regarding the baby's upbringing or how its presence is explained away, but at some point the child is killed  by the chauffeur in a state of drunkenness. The result is a showpiece trial at the Old Bailey , in which the woman at first tries to protect her lover, but is forced finally under cross-examination to make a dramatic public confession that the dead infant was hers.
