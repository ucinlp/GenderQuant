The film follows the Artinian extended family with deafness through three generations over a year and a half, focusing on two brothers — Peter Artinian, who is deaf and Chris Artinian, who has proficient hearing — and their wives and children. Chris and Mari Artinian  find out that one of their newborn twins is deaf. They begin to research the cochlear implant and its advantages and disadvantages. While this is going on, Heather, Peter and Nita's oldest child, starts asking for an implant as well. The brothers, along with grandparents on both sides, become embroiled in a bitter argument over the importance of deafness, the best form of education for their kids, and the controversy of cochlear implants for young children. For Peter and his wife, Nita, it's their fear of losing a child to the "hearing world", and her losing the importance of Deaf culture, which concerns them. They ultimately decide to raise their children in a deaf-friendly community within the state of Maryland, while Chris and Mari's infant, Peter, is given cochlear implant surgery.
