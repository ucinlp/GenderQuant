Roman Kogler is a 19-year old prisoner in an Austrian juvenile detention centre, imprisoned for killing another teenager. In order to obtain parole, he must prove that he can hold down a job outside the prison. After many failed attempts, he gets a job as an undertaker. His co-workers treat him badly, because he's a convicted criminal, but Roman has to put up with them if he has any chance of getting parole. Every day, he takes the train into Vienna and gets off near a holiday ad that reads: "Dive Into Adventure". Brought up in an orphanage, Roman is keen to trace his mother. He manages to find out where she lives and follows her into an IKEA store, where he sees her lying, like a corpse, on one of the beds. They later become re-acquainted and he tells her he's a diving instructor in New Zealand. Back at her flat, he asks his mother why she gave him up and she tells him that it was the best thing she did in her life. She later finds out his real occupation as an undertaker. She also confesses to him that the real reason that she gave Roman up was that, when he was a baby, she tried to suffocate him by placing a pillow over his face. The film ends with Roman being awarded parole and visiting the grave of his teenage victim.
