Reijiro Hieda was known as a young and energetic archeologist, but he passed into oblivion since he began to advocate a heretical theory. One day, Hieda got a letter from Yabe who is his brother-in-law and a junior high school teacher. His letter said that he discovered the ancient tomb which the ancients built to appease evil spirits. Hieda went to the field at once, but Yabe mysteriously disappeared with Reiko Tsukishima who is his student. On the other hand, Masao, the son of Yabe, was looking for his father's whereabouts with his friend in the school during summer vacation and Masao found Reiko. Then Masao was wrapped up in a mysterious atmosphere, and strange creatures appeared. Masao's back emitted smoke and ached suddenly. Hieda appeared, and he saved Masao then they searched for the premises and found a sea of blood and the neckless body. Then, they heard the woman's quiet singing voice. It was Reiko's voice.
