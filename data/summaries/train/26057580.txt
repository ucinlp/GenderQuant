Set in a California subdivision, the story follows four couples who have bought homes and are neighbors. Among the problems facing the couples are alcoholism, racism, and promiscuity. The story truly revolves around the idea of, "NO DOWN PAYMENT" and the over extended nature of some of the families economic situation. Tony Randal is in a role that you would never expect, a car salesman and looking for a good time. Other issues include discrimination against a former war hero for lack of education. The morality lesson is clearly the reason for the film.
