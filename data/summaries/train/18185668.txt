When impoverished Nanette Roland refuses to marry Buck McDougall until she is convinced that her long-absent fianc√©, Raoul Challoner, is dead, Buck obtains false evidence of Challoner's death and Nanette yields to his wishes. At their wedding ceremony, Raoul appears and is about to take Nanette away, when Buck attacks him and, in the ensuing battle, Raoul accidentally kills a man and is arrested. That night, Nanette helps him escape and, after a hasty wedding, they flee into the wilderness. Corporal O'Connor of the North-West Mounted Police is given the assignment of capturing him, and three years later, the Mountie, aided by Buck, discovers Raoul's cabin in the woods. Just as he arrests the fugitive, a forest fire breaks out, trapping Nanette, Raoul and their baby in the flames. O'Connor, injured by a fallen tree, is rescued by Raoul and the four reach safety, but Buck perishes in the fire. O'Connor, feeling a debt of gratitude, agrees to testify to Raoul's death and the family realizes that their troubles are at an end.
