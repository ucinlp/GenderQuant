In this version of the famous plot a group of midget circus runaways decide to form their own community to flee the chaos but come under attack from Mongolian motorcycling ruffians. In response, of course, midgets hire seven tough guys to defend them. The film was shown in many international film festivals as both a fun movie and an oddity. It was billed as "The Last Soviet Film."
