A Room With a View tells the story of Lucy Honeychurch, a young Englishwoman in 1912 who visits Italy with her cousin, Charlotte Bartlett. While there, they meet a host of interesting characters, including the novelist Eleanor Lavish, the tourist Mr Emerson, and his son, George. George falls in love with Lucy, while in Florence, but Charlotte whisks her charge away. It is only when they return to England that Lucy meets George again; by this time, however, Lucy is engaged to Cecil Vyse. While the novel ends with Lucy and George marrying and returning to "the room with the view" for their honeymoon, this adaptation included its own ending, with George being killed in World War I and Lucy returning in 1922 to the room in Florence, where she is implied to begin a new romance with an Italian man.Hellicar, Michael  Timothy Spall was horrified when his son wanted to become an actor: Now they're co-stars in a new TV drama, The Daily Mail
