Danny Kaye plays a double role as a pair of estranged "super-identical twins", with very similar looks, but very different personalities. Buster Dingle, who goes by the stage name "Buzzy Bellew" is a loud and goofy performer at a classy nightclub , while Edwin Dingle is a studious, quiet bookworm writing a history book. The two brothers have not seen each other for years. Buster becomes the witness to a murder committed by mob boss "Ten Grand" Jackson , and is promptly murdered himself. He comes back as a ghost, calling on his long-lost brother for help to bring the killer to justice. As a result, the shy Edwin must take his brother's place until after his testimony is given. In the meantime, he has to dodge Jackson's hitmen and fill in for Buster at the nightclub. To help him out, Buster—who cannot be seen or heard by anyone but Edwin—possesses him, with outrageously goofy results. A famous scene features Edwin, possessed by Buzzy, performing at the Club. Under Buzzy's influence, Edwin pretends to be a famous Russian singer with an allergy to flowers. A vase of flowers is nonetheless placed on a table near him, and his song, "Otchi Chornya", is frequently interrupted by his loud and goofy-sounding sneezes. The story is further humorously complicated by the love interests of the brothers; whilst the murdered Buster was engaged to entertainer Midge Mallon , Edwin is admired by librarian Ellen Shanley . In the end, Ellen marries Edwin, whilst Midge consoles herself  by marrying the owner of the club where Buster was appearing.
