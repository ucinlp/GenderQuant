 Woody is a shy piano tuner who is held at gunpoint by a bank robber named Mugsy  who is on the lam. Mugsy hides out inside the grand piano Woody is tuning, and directs him to start playing immediately. Woody breaks into a rousing rendition of Franz Liszt's "Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2," and manages to play the entire piece while being harassed by a gun-wielding Mugsy as well as a bricks-for-brains policeman  hot on the trail of the stolen loot.
