Ali Baba does not appear in this film, but the band of Forty Thieves do, led by Abu Hassan . Popeye, Olive Oyl, and J. Wellington Wimpy hear of Hassan's attack on a town in Arabia and fly there to capture him but their plane crashes as they enter a desert in Arabia. After getting lost in the desert, the group happens upon the town where the Forty Thieves attack. The Thieves abduct Olive and Wimpy, and Abu Hassan leaves Popeye hanging from a chandelier after failing to win a battle of wits with him . Popeye manages to break free and takes a camel to Ali Baba's secret cave, where, failing to remember the magic word of "open sesame!", he breaks in using his pipe as a torch. Inside the cave , Popeye sneaks past the guards and attempts to free Olive and Wimpy. He confronts Abu Hassan and demands that he give the Forty Thieves' stolen jewels back to the people. He is apprehended and thrown into a shark pit. Just before being eaten by a shark, Popeye tangles the shark's teeth together, and the shark goes back down into the water. Popeye then produces his spinach, opening it by commanding the can "open sez me!" Now superpowered, Popeye defeats Abu Hassan, and all forty of the Thieves . The Thieves and Hassan are chained and made to drag a cart filled with the stolen jewels, Popeye, Olive, and Wimpy, back to town, where the townspeople await them with open arms. Popeye turns to Olive and sings, as the film irises out, "I may be a shorty/but I licked the Forty/I'm Popeye the Sailor man!/*toot toot*".
