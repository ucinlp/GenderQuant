Selleck plays Phil Blackwood, an American mystery novelist who comes across a dazzling Romanian murder suspect named Nina  when she is arraigned in the courtroom he's visiting. Instantly falling for her, Blackwood poses as a Roman Catholic priest in order to meet her while she is held pending her continued arraignment. With the help of his friend, Sam , Blackwood invents an alibi for Nina to secure her release. Nina then takes up residence with Blackwood, serving as the inspiration for a novel that will decide the fate of his and Sam's careers in writing and publishing, all while evading operatives from communist Romania. The climax of the film takes place during The Funeral of Grimaldi, a jovial memorial service in which many clowns gather to celebrate the life of Joseph Grimaldi. Although it was Porizkova's best-known film appearance, her role as Nina in Her Alibi earned her a 1990 Golden Raspberry nomination for Worst Actress.
