In 1895, champion horse racer and livery stable owner Hank Armstrong  is greatly disturbed by the advent of the "horseless carriage" in Maple City. He mocks Elmer Hays, a car manufacturer, when he states in a public lecture that the days of the horse are numbered and that a car will one day go 30 miles an hour. However, Armstrong's efforts are in vain. He quarrels with his friends when they start purchasing the machines and is only stopped from horsewhipping his own car-mad son Bob  by the timely appearance of Bob's girlfriend Rose Robbins . Bob leaves to find a job in nearby Detroit. There, he is present when famed driver Barney Oldfield  breaks the speed record, driving a mile in a minute . Meanwhile, Hank goes bankrupt and has to sell off all his possessions to satisfy his creditors. One day in 1905, Bob returns without telling his father to compete in the first car race in the county. A jealous rival for Rose's affections convinces Hank to tamper with a car on display so that it will explode. When Bob sends Rose to bring his father to the race, Hank is horrified to discover he has sabotaged his son's car. They hurry to the track, but are too late. Bob's car crashes and burns. Hank is convinced he has killed Bob and burns down his livery stable, but Rose brings word that Bob is expected to live. Relieved, Hank gives up his hopeless resistance and joins his son in his car manufacturing company.
