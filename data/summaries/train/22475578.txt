Mammootty plays journalist Ravishankar who is a victim of blood cancer. The knowledge of his disease and the death on its way hugely disappoints him and he loses all his hope in life. His wife Malini  is on her way to a life forward after Ravishankar's death and is in a relationship with Rajendran which is found out to much of his dismay by Ravi but has to acknowledge it as he tries to understand the reality. Meanwhile a doctor who is a friend of Ravishankar convinces him to undergo holistic treatment in his centre. The centre is driven by a theme that each and every cell in our body has a mind which decides whether the body it belongs to should live or die. The treatment does wonders to Ravi and he is on his way to recovery and final checkups confirm that his blood count is normal. Ravi is delighted to come back to his dear life but everything in his hope and joy of life is squandered when he learns that his recovery is a blow to all his relatives including his wife who by now has played without sleeping with Rajendran. He again feels resentment when he learns that his death was more awaited than his recovery. Ravi finally commits suicide as his childhood sweetheart Durga also leaves him. The final line to the audience is the old message that death is the ultimate truth, an inevitable part of life and is in its own way a moment to rejoice.
