When the temperamental star of a new Broadway musical revue in rehearsals walks out, director and choreographer Ted Sturgis  suggests casting an unknown for the role. When it is announced in the newspapers, throngs of hopefuls show up. The revue's musical composer, Leo Belney , champions ballerina Joanna Moss, while gofer Bob Dowdy  is enchanted by novice Suzy Doolittle . Then producer Felix Jordan  persuades Ted's former dance partner, Madelyn Corlane , to come out of retirement to try out, much to Ted's great discomfort.
