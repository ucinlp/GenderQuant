The Stooges are managers of a beefy boxer named Chopper Kane , and they bet their bank roll on his next fight. When a gangster  tells them to have Chopper lose  or they will lose their lives, the boys decide to play along. They try to soften Chopper up by feeding him rich food and having him spend time with their friend Kitty . The fight gets canceled when Kitty dumps Chopper for Gorilla and, in a fluke accident, gets entangled with Moe and breaks his hand against a wall. The Stooges think they have put one over on the gangsters, only to have the bad guys corner them in a deserted warehouse. Instead of being rubbed out, the boys capture the crooks and get a reward.
