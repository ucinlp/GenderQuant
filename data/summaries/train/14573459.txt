The Stooges are small time song-and-dance performers who are having trouble rehearsing due to loud tapping that is going on one story above them. When they go to give the rowdies a piece of their mind, three lovely ladies named Flo , Mary  and Shirley  come to the door. It turns out the girls are performing their tap dance routine. The six become friends and go to a talent agent, Manny Weeks ([[John Tyrrell , to show of their stuff. However, he is at first unimpressed with the Stooges' act, but hires them anyway to perform at the Noazark Shipbuilding Company to entertain defense workers.  The Stooges, as "Two Souls and a Heel", slay the audience with their hilarious "Niagara Falls" routine . When the boys receive word that the headliners  have to bail, they and the girls offer to take their place. Weeks is so enthralled with the boys' performance that he offers to send the trio to Broadway. The Stooges nearly leave their ladies, but end up getting married first with a honeymoon planned for—where else?—Niagara Falls.
