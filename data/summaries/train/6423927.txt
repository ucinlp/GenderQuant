The cartoon features the basic plot of Little Red Riding Hood, with a few twists and oddball Tex Avery-like gags, such as Red displaying a Katharine Hepburn persona, or Grandma ordering a case of gin, while the wolf waits impatiently for her to get off the phone so he can chase her again. The cartoon marks the debut of the proto-Elmer Fudd, who is a running gag throughout the cartoon, and in the end, mentions he's the hero and knocks the wolf out with a mallet.
