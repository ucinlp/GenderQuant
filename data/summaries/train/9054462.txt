Jim is a 12 year old outsider. He has a mother with anxiety and he lives a hard life. At school he is smallest in his class, and compelled to buy beer and smoke and have party's in his garage. Home is different: He's the father of the house, and takes care of his mother, who has isolated herself in bed with a video of the moon landing on VHS. She's not going out of her house due to anxiety. One day Terje  starts in his class. He gets excluded from the class society, but he considers Jim as his best friend making him choose between an outsider friend and his poor social status.
