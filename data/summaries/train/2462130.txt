Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello are husband and wife living in Ohio — far from the surf and sand of their earlier lives together. Heading to California to visit their daughter Sandi , Frankie and Annette are appalled to learn that she has been making time with surfer Michael . In response, they set about to make the beach safe for fun-lovers everywhere by driving out Michael's unsavory friends. Along the way, Frankie faces a challenge to his title from the younger surfers, and nearly ruins his marriage by dallying with Connie Stevens — one of several pop-culture icons appearing in the film, including Fishbone, Don Adams, Bob Denver, Alan Hale, Jr., Edd Byrnes, Jerry Mathers, Tony Dow, Barbara Billingsley, Dick Dale, Stevie Ray Vaughan, O.J. Simpson, and Pee-wee Herman. In the end The Big Kahuna proves that he is the king of surfers, and his title is safe.
