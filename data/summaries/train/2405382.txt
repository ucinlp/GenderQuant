Looking for Alibrandi begins light-heartedly, and the viewer gets a very quick understanding of Josie's character through her interactions with her friends and family. As the film progresses, the glamour that is initially associated with Josie begins to fade as she struggles to cope with her final year of school (especially the racist attitude of one girl in particular, Carly Bishop , the suicide of her crush, John Barton , and meeting with Michael Andretti , her father, of whom has only just found out about her existence upon returning to Sydney for work. She also has continual conflict with her grandmother, Katia Alibrandi . However, these complications are seemingly resolved quickly, in keeping with Josie's brusque and forthright outlook on life. For example, in response to Carly's continuous snide remarks, she breaks her tormentor's nose with a history textbook. It is this summary act that brings her father back into her life. Another complication—the suicide of her unrequited best friend, John Barton—tests her resilience. Struggling with her grief, she finds comfort to a certain extent within Jacob Coote, he was a 'bad boy' on the outside, but he was found out to be a sincere and caring person on the inside. The most significant complication and challenge for Josie, though, is her rocky relationship with her father, Michael Andretti. When they finally get to know each other, and recognise themselves in each other, their rift heals, and she can confide in him.
