Two elderly ladies (one of which is [[Granny , the owners of Sylvester and Tweety, sneak their pets into a hotel where no pets are allowed. Sylvester, hearing Tweety's singing in the room next to his, writes a letter to the canary from his "Ardent Admirer". Tweety shortly discovers who his "admirer" is, and a chase ensues, which is cut short by the doorman, forcing Sylvester to disguise himself  causing the doorman to apologize and flee. Sylvester then sneaks into Tweety's room and tries to get him in his cage; this backfires and he is knocked out by the spring-loaded cage. Sylvester then phones Tweety that his owner has a surprise for him ; Tweety goes downstairs to receive it, but instead goes down Sylvester's throat, returning with a mouse from the time of Thomas Jefferson, explaining he is dead. The chase then goes outside, and into the room of Hector. Sylvester doesn't realize until after he's captured Tweety again that the dog is there. Another chase ensues, involving dog, cat and bird, which is also cut short by the doorman, forcing the three to form a truce long enough to disguise themselves . The chase resumes again, prompting the frustrated doorman to finally make an announcement evicting all pets. Unfortunately for him, a veritable zoo calls the hotel home, and comes stampeding over him. Getting up, the doorman dizzily says Tweety's catch phrase: "I tawt I taw a putty tat!" Tweety, popping out of hiding, replies "You did! You did! You taw a putty tat, a moo-moo tow, a big dowiwwa, a diddy-up hortey, and a wittle monkey!"
