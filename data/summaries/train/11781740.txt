Fantaghirò is captured by the Black Witch who wishes to kill her in order to regain the power she lost in the prior two films. During her incarceration, Fantaghirò encounters a creature made entirely of fruit, who claims to come from another world and to have been in the service of a new, dangerous enemy. Meanwhile, in a far away land, a cannibalistic pirate known only as "Nameless" attacks a peaceful kingdom with an army of fruit-men in order to kidnap and devour the inhabitant's children. His presence causes all edible items in the kingdom to animate and attack the inhabitants. In desperation, the good witch Asteria uses a magical mandrake root to save Fantaghirò from the Black Witch and bring her to the kingdom. Fantaghirò agrees to help, but is saddened because the magical root can no longer bring her back to her kingdom.
