A little mouse is depressed because he has no TV when Speedy Gonzales tells him to use his imagination. Speedy proceeds to say that the smartest animal is the mouse, and the dumbest the duck. Footage from Chuck Jones directed cartoons Robin Hood Daffy and Deduce, You Say, as well as some Speedy cartoons, are used to evidence this. Unfortunately for Speedy, Daffy has been watching the whole time, and emerges through the broken TV and hits Speedy with a mallet for the insults. Speedy decides to go home, stating that "this imagination TV gives me the terrible headaches!" The little mouse then ponders whether it is real or not.
