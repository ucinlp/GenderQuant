Natraj  is an honest, not-too-good-looking, village artist who comes to 'pattanam' to find a job. He ends up being a banner artist. Shwetha  is a U.S. citizen, who loves India and its culture and stays with her relatives to learn 'Bharata Natyam'. She is a soft-natured, loving girl who loves to help people in distress but cannot stand it if anyone lies or cheats. She mistakes Natraj to be a 'vaai pesa mudiyaadha oomai' and at first pities him and later it blossoms into love. By this time, it is too late for Natraj to disclose the truth to her and does not want to risk losing her. At the same time, he is guilt-ridden for not being honest with Shweta. In the end, he cuts his own tongue and becomes a real 'oomai'.
