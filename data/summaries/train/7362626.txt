In the dreary and rigid city of Seoul, there lives a guy in the dumps. His name is Gyung-soo and he's an actor who's fairly well-known on stage. He trusted a director he knew well and acted in his movie, but it flopped. He persistently insisted on receiving his actor's fee, but all he got was a mere grand's worth. He also misses out on his chance to act in the next role he promised to do. The future looks cloudy for him. Gyung-soo goes down to Choonchun City to meet an old friend who's a writer. They go out to the town and Gyung-soo's friend introduces him to a pretty and well-curved dancer named Myung-sook. After having a drink with Gyung-soo and his friend, she suddenly hits on Gyung-soo and on the spur of the moment they hit it off and go to a motel. But no one knew that Gyung-soo's writer friend liked Myung-soo even though he never revealed his true feelings for her. Gyung-soo's relationship with his friend turns sour as Myung-sook becomes obsessively infatuated with Gyung-soo. Gyung-soo tries to put his bad memories of Choonchun behind him and gets on a train headed for Gyungjoo City. Sitting next to him on the train is a woman named Sun-young who entices him after recognizing his face. After she gets off the train, he chases after Sun-young and stops her, but she gives him mixed signals. Gyung-soo follows Sun-young to her house and on the next day he brews up enough courage to knock on her door. This time Gyung-soo becomes infatuated with love.
