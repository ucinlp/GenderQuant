One street, two continents, three months, 12 countries and 13,000 kilometers. The adventure begins in Laredo  and documents a trip through Central and South America to Buenos Aires . The film “PanAmericana” tells stories of lives on and around the Pan-American Highway. It illustrates unique natural beauty, contrasts of wealth and poverty, the importance of money as well as the tireless life’s longest consecutive road network in the world, from northern Alaska to southern Chile. The film was shot on the original historic route between Laredo  and Buenos Aires . The idea of a single cross-continental highway was at the Fifth International Conference of American States in 1923. To consolidate peace, the convention on the Carretera Panamericana finally got signed on 23 December 1936 at the Inter-American Conference in Buenos Aires.
