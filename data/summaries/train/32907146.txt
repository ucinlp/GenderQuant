Lia  and Tina  are two beautiful girls who meet and realize that they have a lot in common. They are both young, beautiful and pissed off, so they decide to hitchhike their way to Rome to find a commune where they can stay and live the life of free love. . . or so they think. Things don't go as they have planned though, and soon they become entangled with prostitution, the police and an aggressive gang.
