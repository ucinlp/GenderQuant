An unseen narrator  tells the story of a Dixieland-music loving dog named John Irving Pettybone (Droopy, voice of [[Bill Thompson . Pettybone's one love is listening to a record of Dixieland jazz, specifically "Tiger Rag", and pretending to conduct the music. Unfortunately, the manager of the dump where Pettybone lives is not a fan of Dixieland, and he evicts the hapless dog from the dump. Pettybone travels to several locations  in an attempt to play his music, but is thrown out each time. Pettybone is heartbroken when his LP is accidentally smashed, but his luck changes when he picks up a group of fleas, "Pee Wee Runt and his All-Flea Dixieland Band". He is chased by the owner of a flea circus into a theatrical agent's office, who mistakenly believes that Pettybone is making the music himself. Pettybone becomes famous as "John Pettybone, Dog of Mystery", and realizes his dream of playing the Hollywood Bowl. As the cartoon concludes with a close up of the flea circus band, the narrator states that no one ever discovered the secret to Pettybone's music cause only Pee Wee Runt knew and would never tell as he, the trumpeter, reveals "for you see, he, that flea, Pee Wee, is me! See?"
