Dollar Dreams was ironically set in 1999. Just at the epicenter of the IT craze. Hyderabad was the hub of all IT related job immigration. The film focused on the lives of 7 young characters. Each of them with a dilemma of their own. About careers in IT and US study/job choices that they feel pressured to make. What happens to them during the course of the story and what decisions they finally make, are a true testament to the very confused frame of mind of several Hyderabadi youngsters in the Pre-Y2K era.
