Several teenage boys in Galesburg, Illinois are murdered, each apparently by a different killer. Local policeman John Brady  investigates. The victims are sons of men who previously collaborated with John to investigate the unethical experiments of Galesburg University professor Dr. Le Sange , who was reportedly killed years previously but still gives lectures via old films. Le Sange's research is being continued by Gwen Parkinson . Unbeknownst to John, Gwen has enlisted his son Pete  as a research subject. Gwen's "experiments" involve mind control, turning the subject into a programmed killer. John, whose late wife had worked for Le Sange, becomes convinced that Le Sange is still alive and is waging a vendetta against those who wronged him.
