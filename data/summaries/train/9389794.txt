Don Justo  hands over the running of his grocery store to his overbearing son and daughter-in-law and escapes to search for his lost dog Badface. Roberto  is a love-struck obsessive-compulsive traveling salesman who drives to San Julián to surprise one of his clients by bringing a cake for her son's birthday. Finally, María Flores  travels to San Julián with her daughter because she has won a spot on "Multicoloured Casino," a fusty TV game show. The film captures a lot of small details that make a realistic and moving depiction of life in southern Argentina.
