In World War II, two American fliers, Captain Hank Wilson  and Sergeant Lucky Finder , are forced to bail out over Germany. They encounter Wilhelm Frick , who hides them from the authorities in his cellar. He enjoys their company so much that he does not inform them when the war ends. Instead, he maintains a masquerade to convince his "guests" that Germany is still fighting. Eventually, after seven years, the Americans find out the truth.
