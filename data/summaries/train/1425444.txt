Ai Lin  and her sister Ai Quan  are computer hackers, assassins and espionage specialists who use their late father's secret satellite technology to give them the advantage over their rivals and law enforcement. They first assassinate the chairman of a top Chinese company. After their successful mission, Police Detective named Kong Yat Hung  is assigned to their case and is able to track them down. The cat-and-mouse chase becomes more complicated when Lin and Ai Quan become the targets of the very people who originally hired them. Ai Quan has always been the assistant at home in the computer, while Ai Lin, the older and better assassin, did the field work. The arrangement made Ai Quan jealous. She just wanted to do field work, but she didn't know that Ai Lin was trying to protect her. She thought Ai Lin refused her more active participation because she was less adept. When Ai Lin fell in love and decided to give up her secret life to marry, the sisters had a falling out. Ai Quan wanted to continue contract killing to prove that she could be as good a killer as her older sister. Yat Hung tracks Ai Quan to a bakery where she is buying birthday cake, which leads to a frantic car chase. Ai Quan is cornered by the police and calls her sister Ai Lin at home, asking for her help. At the same time though, killers, hired by the man who contracted the assassination in the beginning of the film, attack Ai Lin at home and she is killed, with Yat Hung being framed for her death. Ai Quan offers Yat Hung a way to clear her name, but only if she agrees help avenge Ai Lin's death. Left with no choice, Yat Hung teams up with Ai Quan to find the true killer.
