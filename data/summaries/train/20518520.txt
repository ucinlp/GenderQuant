Pierre Bear runs a bowling ball factory in the great North. Pierre mistakenly chops down Woody's treehouse and converts into a bowling ball. Despite this, Woody decides to still reside in it, and goes about trying to outwit the bear. Pierre uses a water hose, air pump, deep freeze and even hocus-pocus to evict the tree's tenant, but all he gets are knotted bowler's fingers.
