Sylvester is in Yosemite National Park and, hearing birds chirping, climbs up the tree to Tweety's nest, despite the ranger's warnings. Unfortunately, he hasn't hatched, so Sylvester must wait him out. Once Tweety does hatch, he decides to poke the cat in the butt with a pin needle, to get him off. Sylvester then gives chase, with Tweety hiding in a hole in the tree; the cat forces him out with an air pump, but Tweety sends up a stick of dynamite instead. The chase then continues to another tree, with Tweety sawing the branch Sylvester is on. Some time later, Tweety is singing about what Sylvester would want with him, while Sylvester sits below, scarred and bruised at attempting to scale the barbed wire. Sylvester hacks the tree down, only to have it fall on himself. He then tries to swing and catch Tweety, but is crushed by a log smasher. Later, people are taking pictures of Tweety, and Sylvester, disguised as a cameraman, eats him, only to spit him out thanks to the park ranger who then bashes him in the head. The next attempt involves Tweety hiding in Old Faithful's geyser. He sets the clock and jumps in, while Tweety sets the clock to 12:00, the time it erupts, forcing the cat upward. Tweety then hops on a log and starts rowing down a river, with Sylvester close behind in a rowboat. However, there is a waterfall ahead; Tweety jumps off, but Sylvester does not, and he desperately tries to row upward once he realizes where he is. Tweety offers assistance by turning on the emergency control; this merely causes Sylvester, not yet in safe waters, to fall down. Tweety then comments that Sylvester is going to hurt himself if he isn't more careful.
