 Private Snafu goes home on leave, where he shares all his infantry's military secrets with his friends and family. He thinks there's no harm done, but he is unaware that the information has been relayed to Axis spies. It isn't long before there are media reports of entire military divisions being wiped out by the Nazis, Snafu's being one of them. Made in May 1944, Going Home was never released because it showed the effects of a secret super weapon that was deemed to be too close to the atomic bomb, which was under development the time.
