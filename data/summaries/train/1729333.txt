Edwin Rumill  is the former first mate of a luxury ocean liner who jumps at the opportunity to take full command of a vessel. Unfortunately, the New Zealand-harbored SS Berwind isn't exactly the luxury ocean liner he dreamed of commanding—it is a utilitarian freighter whose captain has recently died. His crew is also a disappointment, often ill-tempered with their own plans for the ship's fate: two members of the crew, Leroy Martin  and Henry Scott  have concoted a scheme to murder the ship's crew and Rumill and sell the ship for salvage to the highest bidder, expecting to earn around a million dollars. Rumill is faced with the task of rallying the ship's crew to overcome Martin and Scott, a task made even more difficult because of Mahia  - the cook's wife—who makes everyone uncomfortable with her overly flirtatious nature.
