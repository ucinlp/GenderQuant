Brian  begins an unwilling symbiotic relationship with a malevolent slug-like brain-eating parasite called "Aylmer" . Aylmer secretes a highly addictive, hallucinogenic blue fluid into Brian's brain. In return for a steady supply of the fluid, Brian must seek out victims for Aylmer, so that he can devour their brains. The film was largely a metaphor for drug addiction.
