Young and self-confident Danny Masters  is the teen-aged son of the late Harry Masters, the "greatest escape artist except for Houdini". Danny himself is an accomplished magician and escape artist. He leaves home to join Uncle Burke and Aunt Sibyl in their magic/mentalist act; Sibyl welcomes him but Burke is unenthusiastic. Danny soon finds himself embroiled with Stu Quiñones , corrupt son of Mayor Leon Quiñones. The quest for a missing wallet  leads to the comeuppance of the crooked mayor, and separately of his vindictive and out-of-control son. Along the way, Danny comes to terms with the death of his father, the circumstances of which he did not previously know.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083900/plotsummary
