The neighborhood bully, Tuffy, played by Johnny Downs, is determined to lick every boy in the neighborhood. He beats up one boy, makes Jay and Jackie stand on their heads, and makes Bonedust and Scooter bark like a dog. Along comes Joe and Farina wearing bandages, and pretending to be too disabled to fight, but Tuffy beats them up anyway. Joe and Farina encourage the boys to band together and they then chase the bully off. The gang retires to their hideout and draw lots to decide who should finish the bully off. Joe and Farina draw the unlucky lots and go looking for the bully, but Peggy tells them that Tuffy has moved to Chicago. Joe and Farina return with the lie that they beat Tuffy up and threw him in the lake.
