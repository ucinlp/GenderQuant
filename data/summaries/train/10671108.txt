Dirty is a raw, hard-edged story of Officer Armando Sancho , a former Mal Creado  gang member who is forced to choose between his conscience and his loyalty. Recruited into an undercover, anti-gang unit of the LAPD, Sancho brings his street smarts onto the force that he has sworn to protect. With his partner Salim Adel , the two patrol LA's streets the only way they know howâ€”with force. But there is nothing more dangerous than a gangster with a badge and when the two come under fire, only one will come out alive.
