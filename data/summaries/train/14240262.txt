The Stooges are suitors who go on a sit down strike when their prospective father-in-law  refuses to consent the marriages. The strike wins them fame and they receive numerous gifts from fans, including a lot and materials for a house via the United States Housing Authority. The Stooges win the strike and get married, but now they must build their house. Their wives decree that they will have no honeymoon until the Stooges finish the job. Now mad at their nagging wives, they get to work anyway.
