An American artist living a bohemian existence in Paris, Tom Warshaw  is trying to make sense of his troubled adult life by reflecting upon his extraordinary childhood. There is a flashback to Greenwich Village in 1973, as 13-year-old Tommy  is on the brink of becoming a man. While his bereaved single mother  mourns the death of his father, Tommy escapes grief by causing trouble at school and making afternoon deliveries with his best friend Pappas , a mentally challenged janitor. Following the romantic advice offered by Lady  – incarcerated in the infamous New York Women's House of Detention for shadowy reasons – Tommy experiences his first taste of love. Yet when an unexpected tragedy radically alters his world, Tommy must take a life-defining choice – one that will compel the adult Tom Warshaw, thirty years later, to confront his unfinished past.
