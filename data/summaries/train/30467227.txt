Manonmani, the Pandya princess , falls in love in her dream with a prince  who too does likewise with each unaware of the other's identity! But their love grows deeper in their hearts. The Rajaguru  is keen on bringing the two kingdoms together and builds a ‘secret way' from one kingdom to the other. However, the King  is under the influence of the scheming minister Kutilan,  The minister's son Balaiah has an eye on the princess, and the father and son try to manipulate the king's mind… After many twists, the lovers meet and the two kingdoms come together and the ‘dream lovers' marry…. An interesting tale of kings, princes and princesses, Rajaguru and evil ministers, Manonmani was a box office hit with Rajakumari and Chinnappa stealing the show. Sakunthala  played the princess's companion, while the ‘comedy track' was taken care of by the inimitable Krishnan-Mathuram supported by Narayana Rao.
