After a rumble between New York City street gangs, the Hornets and Dukes, a youth is taken captive and threatened with a zip gun by Lenny Daniels, one of the Hornets. The act is witnessed by a neighbor, McAllister, who tells the cops. Lenny is arrested and sentenced to a year in jail. Hornets leader Frankie Dane decides to get even. Incorrigible, the 18-year-old Frankie resists all efforts to get through to him by social worker Ben Wagner or his worried mother, who was abandoned by Frankie's father. McAllister isn't afraid of Frankie and even slaps him. An angry Frankie informs his friends Lou Macklin and Angelo "Baby" Gioia that he intends to kill McAllister now, which frightens Frankie's 10-year-old brother Richie, who overhears. Baby's dad slaps him and orders him to stop hanging out with the no-good Frankie. An effort is made by Wagner to understand the boys rather than be angry with them, and Richie tells him of Frankie's plans to commit murder. McAllister is trapped in an alley at 1:30 in the morning. Richie tries to stop his brother and ends up with a knife held to his throat, but Frankie finally comes to his senses and is accompanied by Wagner to the police.
