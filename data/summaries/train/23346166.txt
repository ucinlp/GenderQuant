Chastity is a 1969 film directed by Alessio de Paola and starring Cher in her first film role as a solo. It was written and produced by Cher's husband Sonny Bono as a star vehicle for her. It flopped badly and deterred Cher from acting in films for more than a decade. Sonny and Cher's child Chastity Bono was conceived during the making of the film, and was named after it. Cher also recorded a soundtrack to the film, which was also a commercial failure.
