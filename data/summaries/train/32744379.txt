Four pathetic narrow minded petty criminals are mistaken for hitmen while ordered to shadow the philandering girl friend of their crime boss Carlito. As a result of a misunderstanding they get hired to accompany LÃ©onore de Segonzac, the heiress of a big asset, on a race through Patagonia and "accidentally" kill her for the sum of four million dollars. They are chased by the principal and the true killers, which for their part are hunted by some UNO blue helmets.
