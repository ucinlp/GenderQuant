Dr. Eugene Ferguson , a renowned American brain surgeon, and his wife Helen  are vacationing in Latin America when a revolution breaks out. They are taken against their will to the country's dictator, Raoul Farrago , who urgently needs a life-saving operation. Over the next few days, while Ferguson trains assistants for the delicate operation, he witnesses various acts of brutality by the regime, especially by Colonel Adragon , but his Hippocratic Oath compels him to do his best. Roland Gonzales , the rebel leader, kidnaps Helen to pressure her husband into making a fatal surgical "mistake." His message to Ferguson is intercepted by Isabel Farrago , the patient's wife, and the operation is a success. Fortunately for the doctor, Helen is released unharmed when Farrago dies soon afterwards and his government is overthrown.
