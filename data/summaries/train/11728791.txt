He works for a corrupt squatter, Stingey Smith , and falls in love with Kitty Carewe , daughter of John Carewe , the squatter next door. John is impressed with Jim's skill in a horse and invites him to train his finest horse, Swagman, hoping to win enough prize money to save his farm.

However Jim rescues the horse and rides it to victory. Smith frames Jim for theft but he is proved innocent and Jim marries Kitty.
