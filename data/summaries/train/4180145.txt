A meteor strikes a houseboat in the swamps near a southern town, causing the people on the houseboat to become zombies. The zombies feed on the alligators in the swamp and when they run out of alligators, they start going for the citizens. When the people start to disappear, a local scientist tries to figure out what's happening and how to stop the zombies from killing more people.
