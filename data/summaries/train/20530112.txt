Woody decides to go to bed early so he can get a head start on quail season the next morning. However, circumstances conspire to keep him awake: first a bright flashing sign on a nearby building, then a loudly ticking cuckoo clock, and finally an insubordinate folding table that he tries  to use as a bed after inadvertently destroying his own. Acting like a bucking bronco, the table eventually throws him out the window and into a bush; three quails, in turn, toss him out into the open, where he literally gets mixed up with a hunter's dogs.
