Having to endure his mother’s anxieties and mental black outs, his only outlet is his workplace; where he feels he can breathe and escape the hell that is his home, even if it is for a little while. But Egemen’s amorous interest in his boss Umay unveils little by little just how much Gulseren has emotionally damaged her son.
