The film is centred around the life of Kate Swallow and her susceptibility for falling in love with different men. At the beginning of the film she is in love with a famous writer named Alec Bolton, who dismisses any intentions she has of writing a novel herself as nonsense, strongly discouraging her. Later falls in love with a man named Vanni Corso who is the publisher of the firm for which Alec writes books, and she leaves Alec for Vanni. Kate later finds out that Vanni also doesn't think highly of her writing abilities yet he had strung her along. Gradually both men change their attitudes as they vainly struggle to win her affections. Walken has a scene where he is able to perform his trademark tango routine.
