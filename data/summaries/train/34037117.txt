San Francisco becomes a target for waves of destructive meteors after a rogue comet orbits around the earth. For astro-physicist, Dr. Michelle Young , what was meant to be a once-in-a-lifetime celestial event, soon turns into her worst nightmare as thousands of meteors break the surface of the atmosphere and bombard the city of San Francisco. Scientists and the military team up to repel the onslaught. Military contacts Michelle Young to investigate this extinction-level event, to determine what's causing the seemingly targeted strikes. Meanwhile, Colonel Tom Young  is responsible for Massive evacuation of the Bay area. Michelle discovers that Element 120, designated Unbinilium is found to be the main cause of meteors targeting the city of San Francisco area which millions of years ago was hit and had Unbinilium at the bottom of the sea bed. She immediately reports Colonel Jack Clancey  about Unbinilium and also mentions that the radiant of the meteor shower is in Cassiopeia. Unfortunately they discover that a gigantic asteroid coined as Apophis is on a collision course with Earth. Michelle checks Apophis' trajectory and realize that it will indeed hit the Earth. Their numbers show that Apophis will hit in San Francisco bay within about 4 hours. With each passing storm, things deteriorate. Michelle and Colonel Jack Clancey informs Gen. Brock ([[Kevin McNulty  of assistance needed from the Russians as US satellites won't be in position to launch ICBM's but Russian satellites are. They acquaint the president about it who starts negotiating with Russian president on phone. Time is running out and president orders that the ICBM be launched immediately. The United States military launches ICBM to destroy the asteroid and the planet is saved from complete annihilation.
