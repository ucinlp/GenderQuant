It all started with a prairie dog screaming after Riggs'  car passes by it and throws a cigar, disrespecting the environment. This causes an unnamed raccoon to allow a mink to release a boulder that pushes Riggs' car down a cliff. After that, the raccoon throws the cigar back to Riggs, who yells "you're a bad raccoon!". The raccoon then blows the car down the cliff. Riggs quits from Mr. Lyman's company, so a real estate developer from Chicago, Dan Sanders , is given the task to turn the forest into a residential development by his boss, Neal Lyman . This all transpires much to the objections of Dan's son, Tyler , who discovers that Rocky Springs is a forest reserve. He warns his father that "many tried to conquer it but failed". His wife, Tammy , is also unhappy in Rocky Springs, where she misses Chicago life. Unfortunately, the animals, led by the raccoon, who live in the forest do not intend to watch their forest being destroyed. They manage to turn the tables on Dan by disturbing his progress- interrupting his meetings, and humiliating him. So Dan with the help of forest rangers sets out to capture all of the forest animals. Tammy is forced to plan an "eco-friendly" fair with a senile teacher  at the high school and Lyman's company decides to sponsor it. The Sanders family are ignorant to the fact that Lyman and his company are actually not eco-friendly and want to cut down the forest to build houses and a shopping mall "with a forest theme". Dan releases the animals. The raccoon and his friends wreak havoc on the eco-fair, causing the guests and entertainers to flee. Lyman accidentally tranquilizes Mr. Gupta, who attempts to break their deal. He flees into a "worm tunnel" with the animals in close pursuit. They begin to attack him, as a bear drives the golf cart  away into a bush. Three months later, the forest is reclaimed as a nature preserve. Dan is a ranger, fining anyone $1 million for violating this ruling.
