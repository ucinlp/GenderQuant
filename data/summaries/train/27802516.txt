The Pink Panther's picnic gets ruined by a tiny raincloud which seems to shadow him at every turn. After several failed attempts at disposing of the cloud, the panther manages to dump it into the waste basket, but when he tries to drop the basket down a bridge, a policeman comes and orders him to release the cloud. The cloud begins to get nastier, generating lightning and turning violent. Finally, the panther goes to a psychiatrist to get rid of the cloud.
