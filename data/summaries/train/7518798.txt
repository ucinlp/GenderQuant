The story is of a modern society endangered by power and greed and the rebellion of the "little people" against corrupt and soulless authority. A group of four prominent men, The General , The Commissar , The Chairman  and The Prospector  discuss how they can increase their fortunes. The Prospector tells them that there is oil in the middle of Paris and they resolve to acquire the rights with or without the consent of the people of Paris. Countess Aurelia , the "madwoman" of the title, learns of this plan to drill for oil under the very streets of her district from Roderick  an activist and The Ragpicker . She enlists the help of her friends, a motley crew of "little people" who include the "madwomen" of neighbouring districts, Constance, the Madwoman of Passy , Gabrielle, the Madwoman of St. Sulpice . A trial takes place in the Countess' cellar presided over by Aurelia's friend Josephine , the Madwoman of La Concorde as judge and the Ragpicker as the lawyer for the defense.
