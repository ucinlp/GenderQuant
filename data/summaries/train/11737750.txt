Pierre Losseray is a surgeon at the public hospital in a small provincial town. He has recently suffered a heart attack but has returned to work. He is appreciated by his patients, and is being hassled by Old Brézé, the owner of a nearby medical clinic, who is losing clients and cannot stand competition. In league with his sons and son-in-law, Brézé uses blackmail. Losseray learns about the story of Doctor Jean-Pierre Berg, another man who was similarly hassled by the same man fifteen years before, and beocmes obsessed with it. Berg killed himself, his wife Jane, and their children, apparently in response to the pressure. Losseray eventually shares the same fate as Berg, and the Brézé clan continue with their neferious activities.
