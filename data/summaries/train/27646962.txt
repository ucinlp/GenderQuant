In the opening, a collision between two alien spaceships occurs. The collision unleashes a capsule which heads toward Earth. The capsule collides with a small ship, causing an explosion. The capsule lands near an undersea research lab, the Oshona. The capsule, full of red crystals, attracts sharks. The sharks eat the crystals which cause them to become vicious killers, eating anyone and attacking anything that comes near them. Now, the researchers of the Oshona are stuck underneath the Bermuda Triangle. The Navy attempts to rescue them, but many people die in the process.
