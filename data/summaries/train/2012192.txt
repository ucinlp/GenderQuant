Police disperse an organized street demonstration of elderly men demanding a raise in their meager pensions. One of the marchers is Umberto D. Ferrari, a retired government worker. He returns to his room and finds his landlady has rented it out for an hour to an amorous couple. She threatens to evict Ferrari at the end of the month if he cannot pay the overdue rent: fifteen thousand lire. Umberto sells a watch and some books, but only raises a third of the amount. The landlady refuses to accept partial payment. Meanwhile, the sympathetic maid confides in Umberto that she has her own problems. She is three months pregnant, but is unsure which of two soldiers is the father, the tall one from Naples or the short one from Florence. Feeling ill, Umberto gets himself admitted to a hospital; it turns out to be tonsillitis, and he is discharged after a few days. When he returns to the apartment, he finds workmen renovating the entire place. The landlady is getting married. Umberto's room has a gaping hole in the wall; the maid tells him it is to become part of an enlarged living room. The maid was taking care of the dog, but a door was left open and Flike ran away. Umberto rushes to the city pound and is relieved to find his dog. With a working friend turning a deaf ear to his veiled plea for a loan, and unable to bring himself to beg from strangers on the street, Umberto contemplates suicide. He packs and leaves the apartment. His final parting advice to the maid is to get rid of her boyfriend from Florence. Umberto attempts to find a place for Flike, first with a couple who board dogs, then a little girl he knows, but the latter's nanny makes her give the dog back. Despite Umberto's attempt to abandon Flike, the dog finds him hiding under a footbridge. Finally, Umberto take the dog in his arms and walks to a railway track as a speeding train approaches. Flike wriggles free and flees. Umberto coaxes the dog back and starts playing with him in the park.
