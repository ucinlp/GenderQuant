The three married men, George , Doug , and Howie , and divorc√© Fred , are friends who commute to work from Greenwich, Connecticut to New York City on the same train. Seeing Fred's philandering boss, Mr. Bingham , with his mistress sets the men to fantasizing about sharing the expense of an apartment in the city as a love nest. As a gag, they give Fred the task of finding an unrealistically inexpensive apartment and a blonde "companion" to go with it. Fred rents a luxurious suite from Peter Bowers , who is desperate to find a tenant . By chance, Cathy , a knockout of a blonde, also answers the advertisement for the apartment. Fred explains that the place has already been taken, but she learns that he is also looking for a beautiful young "housekeeper" for his friends. To his surprise, she accepts the job. The boys are delighted; each tells his wife that he is taking a course one night a week to improve his mind so he can stay in New York overnight. Unbeknownst to the men, Cathy is actually a sociology graduate student writing her thesis on the "adolescent fantasies of the adult suburban male." Her skeptical advisor, Dr. Prokosch , worries that she won't be able to fend off the men, but she is confident about her abilities . When they start calling on her individually in the evenings, she encourages them to talk, all the while secretly recording their conversations. Cathy deftly avoids being seduced by the married men, although each of them brags to the others about having slept with her. She supplies what each one really wants: Howie is starved for more substantial food than his dieting wife will provide; Doug likes to repair things that are conveniently broken each week ; George enjoys talking about himself, but his spouse keeps finishing his sentences. Fred, however, is a different story: he is very attracted to Cathy and, disgusted by his friends' fabricated stories, he refuses to use his night. In the end, the wives become suspicious and, on the advice of Fred's mother Ethel , hire private investigator Ernest Bohannon  to find out what is going on. Based on his report, they assume the worst and confront their husbands. All three married men confess that nothing happened, and Cathy reveals that she is just doing research. After getting over the shock, Fred marries Cathy. Everyone learns a lesson and the boys' night out is no more; instead, the couples go out together.
