Two people, living in Boston and unlucky in love - a nurse  whose activist boyfriend  has just walked out on their relationship to help a Native American tribe fight off a land development deal, and a plumber  struggling to pay off family obligations while pursuing a career as a marine biologist - deal with personal and professional problems and stumble through relationships, continually crossing one another's paths without ever truly meeting and realizing how perfect they are for one another. Time and time again one almost catches the other's eye, but circumstances intervene. Finally, after a series of ups and downs, both of their budding relationships with others crash and burn, just in time for a chance meeting on the MBTA train heading to Wonderland station, on the outskirts of Boston.
