David Coleman  is a young doctor hired by a hospital's pathology department. The head of the department, Dr. Joseph Pearson , sees Coleman as a rival, and they fight over many medical issues. Coleman falls in love with Cathy Hunt , a nurse at the hospital, who develops a tumor in her knee. Pearson believes that the tumor is malignant and that the leg should be amputated, but Coleman disagrees. Coleman orders three blood tests on Mrs. Alexander, an expectant mother whose baby may have hemolytic disease, but Pearson believes that the tests are excessive and cancels the third test. Mrs. Alexander is married to a young intern at the hospital , who, along with Coleman, tried to push for the third test. When the baby is born seriously ill, Dr. Charles Dornberger , Mrs. Alexander's OB/GYN, berates Pearson and conducts a blood transfusion to save the baby's life. Pearson's future at the hospital becomes uncertain, and he resigns. Coleman has changed his mind about Cathy's tumor and agrees with Pearson's decision, while Pearson says that Coleman reminds him of himself when he was young and urges him not to let hospital bureaucracy to wear him down.
