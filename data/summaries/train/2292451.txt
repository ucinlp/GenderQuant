He is keeping the two of them in a secret place on an island in the middle of a secluded lake. He knows that she cannot swim, and is scared of the water. One time, she gets too close to getting away and he then chains her to anchors and other things around the island to make it impossible for her to escape. One day, she lights all their matches on fire, so he is forced to go into town to buy new ones. While he is gone, she gets an axe and breaks free from the chain. He comes back unexpectedly early, and she is almost discovered in her act of escape. He finds her and starts beating her the hardest he has ever done. Throwing her around, pushing her on the ground, hurling objects at her face, and all the while, she is screaming. Finally, she gets a hold of a gun and shoots him. He is not dead, but immobile. She gives him a couple of last words before leaving him to die. She leaves him laying there alone, the gun within reach. A shot is later heard indicating he killed himself. Overcoming her fear of water, she swims across the pond to the other side and walks away down the road to an unknown fate, but free.
