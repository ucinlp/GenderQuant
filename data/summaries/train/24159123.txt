After the daughter of a prominent businessman is brutally murdered, high profile defense attorney Kitt Devereux takes the case of the accused murderer, rapper Bobby Medina. With a history of drugs and violence, Medina is a likely suspect, but Devereux suspects there's more to the case as she locks horns with her ex-husband, D.A. Jack Campioni, and a wealthy woman whose son is a presidential candidate. Dealing with her own tainted past and the unreliable Medina, Devereux struggles to prove her client's innocence even to herself.
