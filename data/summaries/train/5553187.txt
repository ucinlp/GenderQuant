Wealthy ad man Eddie Anderson is suicidal, contemptuous of life and its "arrangements." His long marriage to Florence is now devoid of passion, and he has become the lover of Gwen, a research assistant at his Los Angeles advertising agency. A psychiatrist, Dr. Leibman, listens to stories of Eddie's nightmares and general discontent with life. Eddie returns to work, where he insults a valued client. He pilots a small plane about L.A. and buzzes its skyscrapers recklessly, causing the police to be called. Arthur, his lawyer, gives wife Florence power of attorney as Eddie travels to New York to visit his ill father. Sam is so sick that Eddie's brother and sister-in-law want him placed in an institution. Gwen is also in New York now, living with a man named Charles and telling Eddie of many other affairs that she has had. Florence and sister-in-law Gloria break in and catch him in bed with Gwen. A furious Eddie sets fire to the house and comes to Gwen's apartment, where Charles shoots him. In the end, at his father's funeral, Eddie's life is empty; he tells Gwen "I love you" and she says "Thank you".
