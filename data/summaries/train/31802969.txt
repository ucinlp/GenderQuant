Spork is about a 14-year-old intersex misfit who identifies as a girl. She is unpopular, mistreated by her classmates, and very soft-spoken. Her next-door neighbor and best friend, Tootsie Roll, is planning on entering the school Dance-Off to win $236 which she would use to visit her dad in prison. During a hair-product-related dancing accident, Tootsie Roll injures her ankle and can no longer compete. Spork rises to the occasion and surprises the whole school by signing up for the Dance-Off. The film touches on many controversial issues such as racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, and gender roles on a serious level and keeps an air of comedic value. Spork is also notable for featuring young actors playing their own ages , instead of older teen actors made to look young. It is rare, but not unrealistic, that young actors are seen handling such adult themes and language. The period that the movie is based in is unclear as there are several anachronisms. For example, Spork and Tootsie Roll are listening to hip-hop songs from the early 1990s and wearing 90s fashion, while the antagonist, Betsy Byotch, and her crew are wearing 1980s garb, listening to 80s music yet they worship Britney Spears. The character of Charlie is obsessed with Justin Timberlake which is late 1990's. It is mentioned throughout that Spork and Charlie are obsessed with The Wizard of Oz, but the only difference is Spork's love for The Wiz and Charlie's love for the 1939 The Wizard of Oz.
