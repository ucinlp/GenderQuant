Kate McQuean  is a Miami lawyer who—in the course of a divorce proceeding—attempts to seize a 157-foot freighter docked off the Florida coast in lieu of unpaid alimony. The freighter is the current base of operations of Ilya Pavel Kazak , a former KGB agent who has become an international money laundering expert, and he has also become the leader of a group of terrorists. When Kate is unintentionally hit by a stray bullet, Miami detective Max Kirkpatrick  is assigned to the case, and then an attempt is made on Kate's life. Max becomes her protector, as it turns out that Kazak wants Kate dead. Max and Kate travel throughout Florida, dealing with Kazak's henchmen along the way. When Kazak has Kate kidnapped and taken to the freighter, Max boards the freighter in an attempt to rescue Kate. The film ends when Max and Kate decide to blow up the freighter, to put an end to the whole mess, after Kate refuses to give Kazak the city's money. As the freighter sinks, Kate says to Max, "You owe me a new boat." The duo laughs as a rescue helicopter picks them up.
