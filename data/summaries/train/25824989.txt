Pabitra Baruah is a principal of a high school. He is living a happy and contented life with his caring wife Prafulli and a pair of studious twin children Pritom and Tarali. As a leading villager, Pabitra always stands for the moral values in running the school affairs as well as his daily life. Pritom and Tarali, as expected, top their matriculation and leave for Guwahati for higher studies. But the proud parents do not realise that their children left them forever. In due course, Pritom completes his studies and goes to the U.S. on a company scholarshop. On returning he joins a MNC in Mumbai, gets married to the daughter of his boss and settles down there. Torali, too, after completion of her higher studies in the U.S., gets married to an American and settles there. Both of them are so busy and pre-occupaid with their own life they even could not come back home at the death of their mother. Dinanath Bora is a farmer with his teacher wife Nirmali and children Mohen and Malati. He possesses strong faith and believes in work culture and is always busy with his agricultural activities. The only thing the couple is worried about is their childrenâ€™s negligence towards studies. Mohen is always busy rehearsing his Bhaona and Malati with singing and dancing around with her folks. The children fail their matriculation. But the parents shows them other fruitful means to shape their lives. Mohan with a financial loan buys a tractor and gets fully involved in agricultural activities. Malati with other girls from the village forms a financial self-help group, undergoes training on fruit processing and preservation and opens up a big shop of pickle, jam, jelly and other food materials, etc. in the village. For Pabitra Barua, the neighboring people become the source of succour and an integral part for the rest of his life.
