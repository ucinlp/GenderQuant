One day Sam Clayton  and his gang arrive in the small town of Juno City where Father John  is the priest of the town church. After having a little bit of fun, the gang leaves town, only to be caught by father John. Vowing revenge, the gang guns him down on the steps of his church and then set about taking control of the town while waiting for the stagecoach. However, little Johnny  manages to escape with a couple of their horses and rides off to Mexico in the hope of finding the priest's brother . They soon meet and set off back across the border to clean up the town. Meanwhile Clayton discovers that he is Johnny's father. Also, some fifteen years prior during the Civil War, Jenny O'Hara had been one of Clayton's victims, adding to the mystique of the situation — as well as to the question of little Johnny's paternity — and now, enhancing the plot, Clayton takes to the idea of being a father.
