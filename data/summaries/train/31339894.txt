In this film, filmmaker David Fisher recruits his three brothers and one sister to set out on a journey to find their lost sister. After the death of their parents, Fisher feels that his family has been grown apart and that his siblings have gone their own separate way, focusing on their relationships with their spouses, children and problems at work. Fisher feels that a search for their sister, who was taken from their parents at birth, would provide a good opportunity to bring them closer. Fisher and his siblings, whose parents were Holocaust survivors, set out on a journey to look into their past, which is also the history of the State of Israel and the time when it was established. The siblings become amateur detectives, hoping to find a shred of evidence to lead them to their sister. During this journey the camera reveals some intimate moments within a family, struggling to survive.
