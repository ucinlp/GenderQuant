With equal parts humor and vitriol, Academy Award-winner Richard Dreyfuss and Emmy Award-winner Judy Davis portray Barnaby and Maxine Pierce, a middle-aged couple exploring the ups and downs of a marriage that has spun out of control. They have decided to divorce, but take one last cross country road trip from Connecticut to Los Angeles to attend the wedding of their son and give him their vintage Thunderbird as a gift. By reflecting on the life theyâ€™ve shared together, the couple begins to re-evaluate their marriage and discover the possibility of rekindling their relationship.
