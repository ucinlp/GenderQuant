The film is set in a small Canadian town to which the British Carter family  have just moved, following Peter's appointment as school principal. One night Jean appears restless and disturbed, and confides to her parents that earlier that day while playing in a local wood, she and her friend, Lucille, went into the house of an elderly man who asked them to remove their clothes and dance naked before him in return for some candy, which they did and Jean doesn't believe they did anything wrong. But her parents are appalled by what they hear and decide to file a complaint. The accused man, Clarence Olderberry Sr., is however the doyen of the wealthiest, most highly-regarded and influential family in town and matters conspire to turn against the Carters as the townspeople start to close rank against the newcomers. The police chief casts doubt on Jean's story, while Olderberry's son warns the Carters that if they pursue the matter through the legal system, he will ensure that Jean's evidence and trustworthiness will be torn to shreds in court. When the case come to trial, it is with an obviously stacked jury and in an atmosphere of extreme hostility towards the Carters. As threatened, the Defense Counsel proceeds to question Jean in a harrying, bullying manner which leaves her confused, frightened and giving the impression of an unreliable witness. Inevitably Olderberry is acquitted, after which Peter attacks him physically in a fit of extreme frustration and disgust. The Carters realise that there can be no future for them in the town, and make plans to leave. Shortly before their departure, Jean and her friend are in the wood again when they see Olderberry approaching them. This time forewarned, they run away in panic and come to a lake where they find a rowboat in which they attempt to flee. The boat is however still moored to the lakeshore, and Olderberry begins to pull it back in.
