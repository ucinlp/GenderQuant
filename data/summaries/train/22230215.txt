A former Confederate soldier, John Chandler has come to an Illinois town with his 10-year-old son David to see Dr. Enos Davis. The boy was struck dumb after witnessing his mother's death in a fire, and hasn't spoken a word since. Davis recommends a doctor he knows in Minnesota. With a flock of sheep blocking their path, John has their expertly trained dog Lance clear the way. The sheep belong to rancher Harry Burleigh and his sons, Jeb and Tom, who try to steal the dog. John fights them while a passing stranger, Linnett Moore, holds the child. Harry knocks out John, pours whiskey on him, then tells the sheriff about being attacked by a drunk. John must pay $30 or serve 30 days in jail. Linnett pays if he will work off the debt on her farm. A trip to Minnesota also will be expensive. John won't accept offers for the valuable dog, which the boy loves, but when the evil Burleighs burn down Linnett's barn, he is forced to sell Lance after all. He asks her to accompany the boy up north while he rebuilds the farm. The operation doesn't work, and David is devastated to return home and find the dog's no longer theirs. John goes back to the Burleighs to try to get it back and finds Lance being mistreated by them. Harry gives the dog back, but has his son Jeb prepared to shoot John as a thief. The boy shouts out to save his father's life.
