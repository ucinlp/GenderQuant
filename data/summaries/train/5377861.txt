The Stooges work at Dimsal's Drug Store in Ithaca, New York, where they befriend Schuyler Davis , the owner of the shop next door, who is attempting to build a time machine. With the boys' "help", the machine transports the boys, Schuyler and disaffected girlfriend Diane Quigley  back in time to Ithaca in ancient Greece during the reign of the lecherous King Odius . The King, after defeating and imprisoning Ulysses because the Stooges are believed to be gods, has a yearning for Diane. Realizing they have disrupted the proper course of history, Schuyler and the boys free Ulysses, after which Odius banishes them to the galleys, where Schuyler builds impressive muscles while constantly rowing. After an escape and shipwreck, they kill a monster with the help of Joe's sleeping pills and start billing Schuyler as Hercules at a local gladiatorial arena. The real Hercules  gets wind of their game and confronts them, but after single combat the Stooges convince Hercules to help them rescue Diane in a chariot chase. The time travelers remove the king and, navigating by observing the progress of military technology, manage to set history straight by dumping him off during Indian dominated American Old West where a band of warriors chase him off into the distance.
