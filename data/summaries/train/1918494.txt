Havoc is wrought on the inhabitants of a small New England town by a troubled film production. After the leading man's penchant for teenage girls gets them banished from their New Hampshire location, a film crew relocates to the small town of Waterford, Vermont, to finish shooting "The Old Mill." As its title suggests, the film depends on the presence of a genuine mill, something the town is reported to possess. Unfortunately, with only days before principal photography begins, it becomes apparent that the mill in fact burned down decades ago. Unfazed, the film's director, Walt Price , places his faith in the ability of first-time screenwriter Joseph Turner White  to alter the script; what he doesn't count on is White's apparently bottomless reserve of angst-fueled writer's block. The film's leading lady  refuses to do her contracted nude scene unless she's paid an additional $800,000, while a foreign cinematographer offends the locals by messing with a historic firehouse. Meanwhile, the leading man, Bob Barrenger , dallies with Carla , a crafty local teen. Everything comes to a head after Barrenger and Carla are injured in a car accident, which leads White  to another emotional quandary and into the arms of local bookseller Annie Black . Meanwhile a powerful movie producer  comes to town to help Price with the ensuing mess.
