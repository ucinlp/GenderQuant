Carlos  is a 21-year old who finds himself married to Camila , his 18-year old girlfriend after dating for five years and discovering that she is pregnant. Carlos decides to pursue married life since, he thinks, people marry every day and thus everything will work out fine. He gets a job to support his new family but does not realize the seriousness of his decisions until he discovers that his new boss  is having an affair with his secretary, Lucy , and Monica, his attractive new co-worker  is attempting to seduce him. To complicate things even more, Camila's father does not approve of the decision that she and Carlos made. Carlos struggles to defend himself against his father-in-law and from peer-pressure to be unfaithful to his wife. The title of the film derives from Carlos' co-workers theory that -in Mexico's demographics- every man is "entitled" to seven women and a homosexual.
