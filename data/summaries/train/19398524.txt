Wally had finished filling little Marianne Edwards' favorite doll with sawdust. Just as he was handing it back to her, neighborhood bully, bully Leonard grabs it with a rope and throws it out on a road. A car then crushes it. The gang promise to purchase a new doll for the brokenhearted girl. Unfortunately, the kids have no money, Leonard's equally obnoxious father, who owns the toy store, agrees to give the kids a doll if they will hand over their beloved Pete the Pup in exchange. Balking at this arrangement, the kids concoct a variety of moneymaking schemes, all of them doomed to failure. Tearfully, the youngsters trade Pete for the doll. Pete does major damage to the store seconds later. The store owner then grabs the doll back. But Pete's continued destruction convinces him to hand the doll and the dog back to the gang who then take it to Marianne.
