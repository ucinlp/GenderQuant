College student James  arrives from New Orleans at a desert ranch owned by his father, Hezekiah  to help out. Soon after arriving, James is hit on by Hezekiah's wife, Cheryl , and starts having nightmares. James and Cheryl are caught by Hezekiah having sex, Cheryl and Hezekiah have a fight, then she leaves the ranch that night. Hezekiah drives into town and picks up another woman, Alisha , who also quickly falls for James then disappears. Cheryl staggers into Hezekiah's "studio" , and dies in front of James. He takes her into the house, where he finds his father crying over Alisha's dead body. James calls a care facility because he thinks his dad has gone crazy. They send out a nurse, Patty , who handcuffs Hezekiah to his bed so that the next time somebody gets killed, he can be eliminated as a suspect. In the few days of waiting for the next victim to show up, Patty and James decide to while away the time by having sex. James reveals to Patty that he went to a witch doctor  back in New Orleans to help him with attracting females but was misled; his penis can now detach itself from his body and kill people. A side story involves a sexually confused local mechanic  and his probably intentional delay in fixing James's car, in order to seduce him.
