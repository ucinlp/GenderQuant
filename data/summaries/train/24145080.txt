Two basketball players are drawn into the lures of crime and gambling on the courts of St. Louis, Missouri tough Northside neighborhoods. Constantly searching for sanity in the midst of alcoholism, racism, and drugs, John Hogan and Jacob Whitmore  find release and therapy while competing at one of the most competitive street courts in the U.S. Both must spend an entire summer helping one another overcome adversity. Their dedication and love for the game of basketball transcend from the playground courts into each of their dysfunctional households, where the two boys played the constant role of father figure. Jacob has no choice but to play in an underground league, constantly fighting to keep his cousin Damon out of debt and possible death. Johnâ€™s overpowering guilt and family trauma erupt into a state of beautiful confusion with each spiritual intervention by Terry Gibson, a neighborhood boy killed in a drunk-driving accident. Together, the two paint a sad and hopeful portrait with their innocence, concerns, and faith in the unknown. <!-- TO BE EXPANDED
