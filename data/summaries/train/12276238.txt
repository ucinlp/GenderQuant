After three thieves steal an armored truck and kidnap a witness, the abandoned building they use to transfer the cash to another vehicle happens to be the home of Moe, a penniless saxophone player, who is being visited by his small-time criminal brother Jack. While good-natured Moe only wants to save the hostage, Jack wants to steal some of the money in the truck for himself. Meanwhile, two of the thieves plan to betray the third, not knowing that he too has a plan of his own.
