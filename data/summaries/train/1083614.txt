Tashi  has been raised as a Buddhist monk since age five. When he gets erotic phantasms as an adolescent, his spiritual master decides it's time to taste profane life, sending him on a journey in the real Himalayan world. Once he is told his hottest dream was real, Tashi decides to leave the monastery and marries Pema , the daughter of a rich farmer, who was actually engaged with local stonemason Jamayang . The ex-lama soon becomes a rich land-owner himself, and makes a killing from his harvest by bringing it to the city instead of selling at half price to the local merchant Dawa , but half of his next harvest perishes in a fire, yet he comes through and raises a bright son, Karma . After committing infidelity, contemplated for years, and as he later hears from the promiscuous Indian labourer girl named Sujata , Tashi reconsiders his life.
