The plot is based around a successful, yet very shy painter Yann  who is in love with a married woman Florence . When he finally manages to have a date with her in his apartment, he has to face big problems. His neighbour Boris, another painter  who is extremely jealous towards his young wife Éva, leaves his flat without his suitcase, and when Éva, dressed only in lingerie, runs out of the door to let him know, a draft of air closes her door and she has to ask Yann for help. Unfortunately, that is just the moment when both Boris and Florence turn up. The story gets even more complicated as Florence's husband also comes to Yann's flat, and when Yann, when joking, mistakes a toy gun for a real one, and lightly injures Boris. But eventually all comes to a happy end.
