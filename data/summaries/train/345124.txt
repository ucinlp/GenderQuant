The plot is predicated on the Vatican being controlled by the Mafia. The movie opens with the death of the previous Pope and the Mob's tame Cardinal  successfully persuading the College of Cardinals to elect the Mafia's favoured candidate to the papacy, Albini. Unfortunately, the secretary of the College of Cardinals  is hard of hearing, and announces the similar name of an honest parish priest, Albinizi,  who thus becomes Pope. As the plot develops, the Pope demands to see the Vatican accounts and discovers the gun-smuggling and stolen merchandise operations, and confronts the Mob, who decide that the Pope must die.
