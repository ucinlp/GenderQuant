The film is narrated in flashback by Jake Briggs , a young aspiring playwright, culminating in the production of one of his plays off-Broadway by agent Carl Fisher . The play is a flop, at least in part because the lead parts are given to two actors, Dana Coles and Jason Brett , who are "not right" for the roles. Along the journey, Jake reviews his relationships with girlfriend Joanne , best friend Chris , his mother Shirley , and his mostly absentee father Roman . The film ends with Jake and Joanne going their separate ways, mostly because of competing career goals, and Jake hoping to write more plays with greater success.
