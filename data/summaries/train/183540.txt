During the restoration, he starts a relationship with Mehmet.Steam-Scene Meanwhile, Marta has arrived in Istanbul to get a speedy divorce from Francesco, but she is taken aback when she realizes how much Francesco has changed from his Roman self: both the hamam and Mehmet's unconditional affection were just what he needed, giving him back a purpose in life.
