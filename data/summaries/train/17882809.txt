Pudgy the Puppy, out for a stroll, meets a mean bulldog. Impressed by the tough dog, Pudgy imitates his behavior. Betty, seeing this, sings the title song to Pudgy in an attempt to stop this. Pudgy ignores her and follows the bulldog, but his attempts to be tough only land him in trouble. After an attempt to steal a meal from the butcher nearly gets him skewered, Pudgy runs back to Betty, who welcomes him home.
