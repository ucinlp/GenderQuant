Bugs is pursued by Wile E. Coyote, who fancies himself as a "genius" who can easily capture Bugs for dinner. Bugs is able to easily foil Coyote's plans, including a gag where Bugs acts goony considering Coyote to be his "father" joyfully greeting him after he comes "back from Peru" Bugs thought he had been run over by an elevator. When Bugs greets him with a kiss, Coyote throws him down, and Bugs starts to cry. Bugs ducks when Coyote charges him and falls into the boiling water. Bugs again thinks he is drunk and Bugs gets away after he plans to go and tell on Coyote. Bugs finally stops his hungry rival by blowing him up with a hand grenade that Coyote tried to use on him. In the end, a dazed Coyote emerges from the rabbit hole saying: "How do you do? I am a vegetarian. My name is Mud. Is there a doctor in the house?" Bugs says to the audience: "Well, like the man says, don't take life too seriously, you'll never get out of it alive."
