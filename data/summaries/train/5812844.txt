The tale begins when architect Harold Berger  arrives in India to meet with Maharahaja Chandra , for whom he will build schools and hospitals. En route to the Maharahaja's palace, Berger meets a dancer named Seetha  and saves her from a tiger. Seetha, whose father was European, is promised to the Maharahaja, but she and the architect begin to fall in love. Predictably, this leads to a buildup of tension between Chandra and Berger, helped along by scheming palace courtiers. The film is also filled with action, and a highlight of it is Seetha's first ritual dance. At the end of Tiger, Seetha and Berger are imprisoned but escape into the desert just as Berger's sister and her husband, also an architect who works with Berger, arrive in Eschnapur. Chandra informs them the plans have changed; he now wants a tomb to be built.
