Spookley the Square Pumpkin was found in the pumpkin patch by Bella and Boris. Two pumpkins aren't very nice to him, so he feels left out. At first the other pumpkins make fun of him because Spookley is square. Jack  allows him to compete in the 'Jack-a-Lympics' contest. He saves the residents of the farm within a storm. He showed kindness to the pumpkins that made fun of him and saved their lives. At the end, it shows the farmer carrying Spookley into his house and shows him on the farmers porch lit up with a candle.
