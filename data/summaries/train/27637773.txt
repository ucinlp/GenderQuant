No Way to Heaven begins on a remote island in Southeast Asia. There, Fritz Joss, a young man from the Swiss mountains has decided to stop eating â€“ once and for all. He plans to find sustenance in pure light by applying what is known as the "21 day process". Fritz sets off on his endeavour, but the planned conversion to "breatharianism" is much more difficult than anticipated.
