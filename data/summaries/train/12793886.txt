Vera is a transsexual girl who lives in a correctional facility for young people. After a book of verses about her life as a young troubled youth, she meets a benevolent, educated man, who helps her, even allowing her to spend some time at his home, and arranges for a job for her as an intern in his office. She sees herself and dresses as a man , in a typical sexual crisis-type behaviour, and falls in love with a woman, even passing for a guy to her girlfriend's family. The film succeeds in focusing on Vera's personality and feelings until her tragic death.
