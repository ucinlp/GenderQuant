Reach for Me explores the age-old quandary of how we greet our final days - and who will be there with us at the end. Alvin, portrayed by Oscar Nominee Seymour Cassel, makes life hell for everyone else around him as a widower confined to his hospice bed. Old and bitter, Alvin is content to waste away the last of his disappointing life at Valley Meadow Hospice. He simply wants to be left alone but his wish is not granted when terminally ill Kevin  becomes his roommate. Young and full of “life”, Kevin refuses to squander the precious moments he has left. Deeply in love, Kevin and his girlfriend Sarah  are devoted to making their days fun and meaningful. Encouraged to stand up for his life by his nurse Evelyn  and stirred by the young couples zest for life, Alvin takes a chance and pursues Valerie . With Valerie, Alvin confronts his fear, loneliness and regret and learns to love – maybe for the first time. Reach for Me attempts to tackle end of life issues, by mixing comedy and drama.
