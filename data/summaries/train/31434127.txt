In this two reeler short comedy, Clark and McCullough, as International Agents Blackstone and Blodgett, are hired by Charles Irwin as Nikki, the Prime Minister, of a small mythical country, to save the Kingdom from a glut of garlic, salami smugglers. When he finally gets out of bed, King Pfui, Ferdinand Munier, is impressed when they catch “The Beard”, Francis McDonald, as Disputin, spraying him with seltzer waters, to convince him to give up the location of the other smugglers in the ring. Little do any of them suspect that it is really Leni Stengel, as Queen Olga, with her Ladies in Waiting, who is really behind it all. It looks like it’s going to be off with their heads! But, it turns out to be a bunch of baloney!http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024212/
