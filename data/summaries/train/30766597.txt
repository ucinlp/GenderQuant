Dick and Mandy ([[Phil Davis , friends at school, sweethearts, and now newlyweds, are moving into their first home. Their new council-owned house turns out to be next door to their Religious Knowledge teacher at school, 'old Butcher' . He is married to fellow teacher Christine , 'earnest, in specs and angora cardigans.' They have a somewhat joyless marriage. Dick and Mandy are locked in disagreement over whether to have children. They are visited by another friend from school, Sharon , and also, consistently throughout their settling-in period, by Mandy's older sister, the fussing Gloria , who seeks escape from being stuck at home with her tyrannical mother.
