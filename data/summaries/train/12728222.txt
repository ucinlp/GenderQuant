The film follows the fortunes of a 17 year old, Del  and his group of friends. As the film opens four youths  are seen breaking into a cafe in Stratford, East London, but they only get away with about ninepence and some cake, and it is clear that they are hardly master criminals. Back at their hut on waste ground they mention Jo , known as 'Bronco Bullfrog' , who has just got out of Borstal. Once Del and Roy  meet Jo in a caff, they link up with him to carry out a bigger robbery. Meanwhile Del meets Irene , a friend of a cousin of Chris', and they start a relationship, despite the disapproval of Irene's mother and Del's father. The remainder of the film follows Del and Irene as they attempt to escape their dead-end lives.
