Jessie Cantrell's dying wish is that her daughter, Casey, personally take a letter to Lord Richard Bredon who lives in the UK. Though confused by this turn of events, Casey nonetheless sets off from her home in America to fulfill this last request. After a failed attempt to find him at his country residence, she falls in with Lord Bredon's son, Michael. At first the younger Bredon is suspicious of Casey's motives but soon the two of them find themselves in the midst of a deep and powerful connection that they both realize is love at first sight. Eventually Casey is able to successfully find Lord Bredon in London. While visibly shaken by the news of Jessie's death, he denies ever having known her and refuses to accept the letter. Instead of deterring her, Richard's refusal only serves to make her more determined to uncover the truth. With the help of Michael and his best friend, she begins to ferret out the information, discovering a nest of lies at the heart of which is Michael's mother, Emily. Emily's determination to be the mistress of Bredon Hall and Richard's wife led her to manipulate events in her favor and separate Richard and Jessie, a couple who had fallen in love during the horrors of World War Two. After being given the information, Richard confronts Emily, but she isn't going down without a fight. She has one last trump card to play. A secret that has the potential to shatter the new found love between Michael and Casey forever.
