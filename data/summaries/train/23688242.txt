Crime and corruption have taken over Bombay City without any solution. A rash of kidnappings of young women takes place. One auto-rickshaw driver Auto Kesariya is behind this crime. The policemen of Kala Chowki Police Station are doing little to stop these crimes. Former Assistant Commissioner of Police, Arjun Verma is reinstated and assigned to this case. Arjun gets himself deeply involved in this disappearance and the kidnappings and faces the shock and trauma of finding skeletal remains of young women who have been abducted as well as body parts stolen from innocent patients from hospitals. His personal life also turns upside down as his fianc√©e abandons him on his wedding day, while his niece is abducted and held for ransom, and above all Arjun Verma himself becomes the target of assassins hired by influential politicians and senior police officials.
