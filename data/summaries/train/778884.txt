The plot concerns a mercenary named Michael Gold  who is sent to convince Dr. Braun , a Laser specialist, to defect to the United States before the KGB acquire him and use both his talent and a stolen diamond to create a nuclear weapon. Dr. Braun is captured by the KGB and Gold is sent on a mission to rescue both him and the diamond. He has to enlist the help of Dr. Braun's daughter Alissa , whom he eventually falls for. The pair confront Col. Kalishnakov , whom they subdue by hitting him with a truck in the climax of this story. Despite the name of the movie, there are not that many scenes in the movie depicting lasers. At least two scenes feature lasers, as Michael Gold sets off a laser guided motion detector. The film was also featured on the third episode of the second season of This Movie Sucks! with Ed the Sock, Liana K and Ron Sparks making fun of it, most notably making reference to Borgnine's advanced age and the ridiculousness of the plot.
