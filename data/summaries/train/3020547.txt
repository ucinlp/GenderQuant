Irish-American Kerry O'Shea ([[Don Murray  is studying medicine at the College of Surgeons in 1921 Dublin, Ireland. Apolitical and sick of killing after fighting in WWI, he is drawn into the struggle between the Irish Republican Army and the British Black and Tans after his friend and fellow medical student Paddy Nolan  is shot and killed. Complications ensue when Kerry falls for a beautiful English hostage, and the British offer a peace treaty that is not enough to satisfy Sean Lenihan, the leader of the rebel organization, and Kerry's former professor.
