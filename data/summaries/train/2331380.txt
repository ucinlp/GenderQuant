The plot remains essentially the same as the novel during the first part, though some of the characterizations are based more closely on the script of the 1965 film. However, the ending is completely different. Another departure from Christie's text is that this time the action takes place not on a deserted island, but in a hotel deep within the Iranian desert. A group of 10 people, strangers to one another, have all traveled to a hotel located deep in the deserts of Iran. Upon arrival they discover that their host is mysteriously absent. They are accused by a tape recording of having committed various crimes in the past which went unpunished by the law. As guests start to die, the remainder deduce that their unseen host is determined to murder them. Since a search of the hotel proves that there is no one hiding among them, they realize that the murderer is one of them.
