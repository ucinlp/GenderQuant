George Tatum  journeys back down to his home in Florida. Along the way, he has recurring nightmares of a violent incident from his childhood, which forces him to kill again. George's ex-wife, Susan Temper , young son C.J. , and the family babysitter begin to receive "hang-up" calls, which none of them realize is George making sure his family is home. The closer George gets to his destination, the more gruesome his murders become and the memories of his first childhood-murder intensify. Wearing an old-man mask to conceal his identity, George makes his way into his old house with an icepick, kills the babysitter, and goes after his son and two daughters , who have taken refuge in their mother's bedroom on the second floor. Young C.J. manages to shoot the masked-maniac through a hole hacked into the door, causing George to fall back down the staircase. As he lies dying, George has a full recall of his childhood, where upon catching his father  cheating on his mother  with a mistress, he brutally murders both of them with an axe. As George is carried off in a stretcher, his wife comes home, identifies her husband, and goes into a screaming fit. Young C.J. is taken for questioning by the police, and winks into the camera as the final image of the film.
