Somewhere in Wichita, Kansas, David is a potential college football star who's just won a four-year scholarship to a college somewhere in Oklahoma. His mates decide to throw him a serious farewell party while his folks are out that night. Unfortunately three uninvited guests secretly gatecrash these nightly celebrations, two are convicts who've fled from lockup, now hiding out somewhere in the home's cellar, while our third interloper is a mental patient escapee, with a connection to the party guests and notably David himself. Before long, homicidal rage resurfaces in one of this trio leading to a carnage-filled rampage.
