A cyborg named Gabriel  was created to destroy all other cyborgs. He later runs into and saves Nea  by killing Simon,  who is one of the other cyborgs. Gabriel trains Nea to become a cyborg killer to help him on his journey. They go on together killing cyborgs until Gabriel gets blown in half by a cyborg, then taken to the cyborg camp. Nea discovers the cyborg camp and then challenges Job  to a fight. She then kills one of the cyborg soldiers, then she starts to kill most of the cyborgs, and their soldiers. Then she finds Gabriel, and straps him to her back, and together they battle more cyborgs until Gabriel orders her to put him down so he can attach one of the cyborgs legs to himself. Now they head after Job, but before they can get to him the Master Builder captures Nea's brother, and takes him to cyborg city. While that is happening Gabriel is fighting Job until Gabriel hits Job in the face, and his face explodes, then Job tells Gabriel about the population of the cyborg existence, and how they can't be stopped. Job dies moments later, then Gabriel and Nea ride off into the sunset, on a quest to find Nea's brother at cyborg city.
