The film tells the story of the heavily outnumbered infantry soldiers who fought off an assault by 1500 attackers who raided a section level outpost of an Infantry Battalion in South Waziristan Agency on the night of 29 May 2009. 43 Punjab jawans were killed in the battle, and their deaths are reenacted in the film, as well as the actions of two "Ghazis"--Sepoy Mashooq and Sepoy Muslim--who held their positions until reinforcements came. The film aims to depict the sacrifices and achievements of the Pakistan Army in the Global War on Terrorism as well as the Pakistan Army's "glorious resolve" to uproot the menace of terrorism from the "land of the pure".{{cite web}}
