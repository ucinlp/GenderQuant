{{Rewrite}} Thodoros  and Fofo  are a married middle-class couple, stuck in a rut. Thodoros has "invented" an out-of-town friend, Lefterakis, who is conveniently in Athens everytime Thodoros wants to have a night out with his mistress. One evening, while in the middle of a card game with his friend Thanassis , he starts explaining his scam to him; they are interrupted however by the maid, who announces that Lefterakis has just arrived from Patra. Fofo, apparently oblivious to her husband's horror and Thanassis' confusion, invites Lefterakis  to spend a couple of days at their place. Over the next couple of days, Thodoros is becoming more and more paranoid, as he first suspects that someone is playing a prank on him, then that he's being blackmailed and, as the fake Lefterakis seems to know a lot of details about him, that he's indeed losing his mind. In the end it is revealed tha Fofo has known about Thodoros' infidelities and the invention of "Lefterakis" for a while and has planned the whole thing to teach him a lesson, asking a friend to impersonate "Lefterakis". The couple finally decides to put their differences away when Fofo announces she's pregnant.
