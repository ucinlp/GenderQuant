Unity is divided into four parts: Body, Mind, Heart and Soul. Part One focuses on food, emphasizing how the food consumed affects one's energy level and influences their mind. Part Two is devoted to an understanding of the human ego, which always perceives opposites in one another, . Part Three is centered on emotion and the human capacity to love, which actually enables us to go beyond these opposites. And Part Four is about a higher level of consciousness. The anthological film and audiobook present a hyperbolic reference to hominid taxonomic nomenclature that may serve as a microcosm of the Unity theme. Chapter two features the introduction of two hominid variants with their contrasting diets, Homo fructus  and the more aggressive Homo corpus , who branched from H. sapiens. Although H. fructus eat biochemically compatible food, inversely related to diseases of affluence, H. corpus consume ghoulish and self-injurious diets of animal tissue and ungulate liquefaction necrosis. Both psychological types naturally digest raw, whole fruit best and both degrade digestion with non-fibrous food intake.{{cite journal}}{{cite journal}} Psychosociological conditions  and decompensations  are attributed to the culturally-determined, cryptonecrophagous diets lacking phytochemicals. Hominidae also share the genetic capacity of empathic arousal, with further developed mirror neurons and abundant syntheses of oxytocin.{{cite journal |pages10.1073/pnas.0935845100 |title2003 |last1L. |journal100 |issuel7AWnfFRc7g>Decety, J., Ickes, W.

Esmeralda Mujanic commented that, Homo animalem corpem consumit means "man consumes dead animal" and Homo fructum consumit means "man consumes fruit."Esmeralda Mujanic, personal communication, April 16, 2009. But for simplicity, "H. corpus" and "H. fructus" are used, respectively. In actuality, there are relatively few genetic, metabolic or breast milk composition differences between hominids.{{cite journal}}McArdle, et al. .

There are no distinct human biological typologies. Homo sapiens means wise  man . But if the abundance of available biochemical, comparative anatomical, psychological, epidemiological, sociological and anthropological research pertaining to aberrant behavior, acquired digestive disorders and rampant diseases associated with animal consumption is valid, then 'sapience' is not a salient feature of humans taking meat or viscoelastic bovinae dairy, when food is available.{{cite journal}}{{cite journal}}{{cite journal}}Allen, M.
