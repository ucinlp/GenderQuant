Katherine  is an English photographer who, with her husband Patrick , came to live at a coastal town on Rhodes before the tourists discovered it. Their thirteen-year-old daughter Chloe  grew up there, and even though Kath and Patrick have separated, they have both stayed on. He supports himself through his sculpture pieces, which Kath despises, and she, by her photography books featuring antiquities and peasant life, which he finds fuddy-duddy. Kath needs money; her latest book isn't selling. She will be forced to give up her house and leave the island she loves unless she can find a buyer for a vase that was given to her many years earlier by a famous, now elderly art historian, Basil Sharp ([[Sebastian Shaw , who arrives for a visit. Katherine's widowed friend Penelope  regards the tourists as enemies, an army of occupation, and battles with her son Yanni, who appreciates the prosperity the tourists bring. Rick , a practical-minded Englishman, fixes Kath's toilet, and becomes smitten by Kath after she rewards him with a passionate kiss. His wife Carol  occupies herself with Byron's poetry and the tourist-loving Yanni. The group is completed by Konstantinis , a wealthy Greek-American who wants to buy Kath's vase, but needs it to be declared a fake so that he can take it out of Greece.
