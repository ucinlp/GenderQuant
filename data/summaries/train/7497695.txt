Eric is happily serving espresso in his London coffee bar when a strange-looking man  tries to persuade him to remember a tune as a clue to some evil plot. Unfortunately, Eric is tone-deaf. Ernie Sage  enters the coffee bar and Eric tries to get him to identify the tune, without much success. Eventually Sage realises that this could be something to do with a forthcoming visit by a Russian trade delegation and an assassination attempt by an organisation known as "Schlecht"this is German for "bad", or "evil", although there is little evidence of German involvement to sabotage this mission. He reports this to his superiors in Military Intelligence , and they reluctantly agree that only Eric, having heard the tune, will be able to lead them to the centre of the plot. Eric is persuaded to pose as a British agent – the recently deceased Major Cavendish – who had managed to infiltrate Schlecht. After a few set-piece comedy interludes, the tune is identified and the plot switches to a performance of Swan Lake, the projected venue for the assassination. This section provides some of the funniest moments of the film- for example Eric, masquerading as a Russian, adopts a broad Scottish highland accent; during the ballet performance itself, Eric and Ernie, dressed in Egyptian costumes, get mixed up in the "Dance of the Little Swans". Finally, however, the villain is unmasked and all is well. Eric returns happily to his coffee bar.
