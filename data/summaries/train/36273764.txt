Paul Varderman is a lanky sixteen year old lad whose world is the coarse litter strewn grass of the playing fields of his run down city school somewhere in Northern England. Paul and his Dad, a feckless has-been of a character, are like ships that pass in the night. Whilst both know something is amiss, both do nothing about it. The coldness and lack of love that surround Paul pose the question in our mind - is the grim battle ground of the playing field a warmer and more welcoming world than his home life? At sixteen for all these kids it's sink or swim and each one is a prisoner in this world where fear rules. There are friends, there are enemies, there are gangs you do belong to, gangs you don't, and as a late arrival at the school there is pressure on Paul to make a choice, and of course, there is the girl of his dreams.
