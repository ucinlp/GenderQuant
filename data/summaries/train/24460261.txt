Sameer Behl  comes to Mumbai with Bollywood dreams, struggles through the day as a courier boy and keeps failing in auditions for advertisements. More stereotypes are stuffed in as he refuses to take help from his dad in Delhi, is thrown out from his rented flat by the landlord and comes away with his calculative companion. One day, a movie director, Rajeev Sharma,  sees Sameer dancing and calls him to his office.Soon Sameer is signed as the male lead in his film and friend Tina  is selected as the choreographer on the same project. Homeless, Sameer sleeps in his car and works as a dance teacher in a school. Subsequently, Sameer loses his film and is disillusioned. Tina finds out this and asks him how he can spend his life like this. After some time, Tina tells him that she also quit the film and did not want to be the choreographer for that film because she saw him upset. Sameer realised the love Tina had for him. Tina encourages him to participate in a television talent-hunt show, the winner of which will win the same role that Sameer was to play. After some time he agrees to participate in it. After filling up the contest form, he also says "I love you" to Tina. In his screen-test, Sameer dedicates his monologue to his mother. After his monologue, during the interview, he comes to know that his father's shop in Delhi has been demolished. He promises Tina that he will come back for her and leaves. He leaves Mumbai to meet his father, heart-broken about the whole thing. After watching Sameer's performance in the TV, his father convinces him to go back to Mumbai and participate in the show. After coming back to the show, he is initially denied an entry at the show due to his late entry, however he is given a chance to perform at the show after Sameer convinces the director. He wins the show and is shown later to be the hero of the movie "Chance Pe Dance" walking the Red Carpet a year later with Tina.
