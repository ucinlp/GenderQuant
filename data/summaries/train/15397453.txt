The plot revolves around the gang swapping places with a group of runaway boys who are supposed to be taken by train back to San Francisco. This plot is repeated in the 1932 short, Choo-Choo!. While aboard the train, the gang wreaks havoc for the other passengers. Jackie Condon rescues his dog, T-Bone, from the baggage compartment and this causes considerable disturbance with the conductor. He later changes clothes with a little girl, played by Mary Kornman, and they both get spankings by the adults. A traveling salesman volunteers to entertain the children with his noisemakers and fireworks. The gang then parade up and down the train with whistles and kazoos. They set off the fireworks, release sneezing powder , pass around other practical jokes and mayhem results. When they finally arrive at San Francisco, the child care worker receives a telegram informing him that he has the wrong children and must take them back.
