In the jungle of Oaxaca, the 'Indio' Fernandez show us a passionate drama which preserve his very particular style in spite of the years, those years allow too some series of bad words in the film which made it more believable. Pilar Pellicer as the Choca seems to be rude enough to resist anything, however she succumb in front of the carnal desire represented in one of the bandits, who had killed her husband and attack her family-intense feelings- essential factor in Indio's films are shown, in this time in violent way. The very desirable Meche Carre√±o,shows gently her body every time she touch water, maybe 'cause she doesn't have any other purpose in the movie, however when Salvador Sanchez tries to rape her, he didn't get it. an entertain film towards the end of the career of the most awarded director in the golden years of our industry.
