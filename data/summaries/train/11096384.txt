The film is set up amongst the landscape of two potentially related murders: that of an engaged woman in Sunshine, and that of seven passengers on a train in Melbourne's inner west. From there, the film deals primarily with the experiences of Lavinia Smart , a young woman who boarded the train shortly after the murders, and police Constable Graham McGahan , who is afflicted with increasingly severe tinnitus. Constable McGahan mans the night shift of a police information van in the inner-western Melbourne suburb of Sunshine, where he encounters the traumatized members of the local community. Furthermore, the film explores the fear Lavinia is in after the horrific events she witnessed.
