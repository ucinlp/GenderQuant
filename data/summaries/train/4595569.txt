Hank  and his wife Madeleine  live contentedly with their wild animals: four tiger cubs, two elephants and 110 tigers, lions, leopards and cheetahs. All is peace and tranquility until one terrible day when two mercenary game hunters are viciously mauled. As the lions and tigers fight for supremacy, Hank and his family, terrified of the danger they now face, seek refuge in their ranch house. Their only means of escape is blocked by the now savage pets they once loved. At the end they all live peacefully. Hank's intention is that only humans can live with the wild animals without interrupting the laws of nature.
