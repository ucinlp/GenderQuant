Tomoko  is investigating a rapist who is terrorizing the city, but at the same time derails the search by grabbing the wrong suspects. In one scene, which the Weissers call "staggeringly repulsive", the rapist inserts a lightbulb into his female victim and starts kicking her stomach until it shatters inside her. The Weissers describe the film as misogynist and mean-spirited, but add that "the project is expertly handled by director extraordinaire Ohara."
