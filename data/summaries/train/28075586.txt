The United States elects its first female President in the form of Leslie McCloud. She and her first gentleman, Thad, move into the White House with their daughter Gloria and son Peter. Immediately, the new President is too busy for her husband and family as she deals with a powerful opposition senator , and a Central American dictator (Eli Wallach}. Thad attempts to find something meaningful to do as the "first lady." Much time is given to his chagrin at being assigned an ultra-feminine bedroom and office within the White House. It is clear that no one, especially Thad McCloud, has given any thought to how a President's husband might fit into the scheme of things. Enter Doris Reid Weaver , Thad's former flame and now an international business woman. She wants Thad back -- and offers him a lucrative position in her company as bait. Leslie has asked him to show visiting dictator Valdez around Washington, with disastrous results. To further complicate things, the first daughter is running around town with a very unsuitable boyfriend and using her position to get out of scrapes with the police. Son Peter has become a bully, using his Secret Service men for protection as he terrorizes everyone in his school -- including the principal. The only solution, in 1964 of course, is for Leslie to discover that she is pregnant, and resign the presidency in order to devote herself full-time to her family.
