The short film begins with a chorus of singing flapper cats. Bimbo waits on a hungry gorilla and then goes to the kitchen to prepare the order, roast duck. When he is about to bring it to the gorilla's table, he sees Betty Boop performing on stage and falls in love at first sight. He completely forgets about the hungry customer and dances on stage with the duck. The gorilla gets furious and goes after Bimbo, who then escapes on a wooden train.
