But what he's about to discover is an underground military court where those judged guilty are forced into a lethal sport of hunting - and they are the prey. With a black market betting system that has its tentacles in every U.S. army base, it will take more than surviving the game and bringing down the sadistic ringleader to stop the body count from rising.
