The plot follows a stuffy, nerdy Swede, Stig-Helmer Olsson , who travels to the fictional town of Nueva Estocolmo in Gran Canaria. At the airport in Sweden, he meets a man from Norway, Ole Bramserud . Before the trip, he calls for a meeting with a psychiatrist called Dr. B. A:son Levander for treating his flying-fear. Levander then cons Stig-Helmer into smuggling money to Nueva Estocolmo for another of the travellers, Gösta Angerud  by telling him that he has an aunt at Nueva Estocolmo and gives Stig-Helmer the money in a christmas present.  Among the other travellers are two middle-aged women, Maj-Britt  and Siv ; the alcoholic duo Berra Ohlsson  and Robban Söderberg  who looks for a liquor store named Pepe's Bodega throughout the movie; and the Storch couple who are laughed at by Berra and Robban because of the similar pronouncing of Storch and stork.
