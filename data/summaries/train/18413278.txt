The plot deals with nine strangers{{Citation needed|date"pi8">{{cite news}} The ship's steward soon appears and explains "the rules" to them: First, do not breach any closed doors. Second, do not enter the captain's quarters. Third, do not refuse any orders from a member of the crew. And don't smoke. The unfortunate passengers soon find out that the ship is haunted by malevolent spirits and that they've all been brought there for some mysterious reason. The spirits take those who have committed greater sins . Most of the seven strangers die because they broke a rule. The first is a convict who smokes. He is attacked by a ghost and is thrown into hell. The second is a drug addict. He refused an order from the steward and has the life sucked out of him. Next, a producer and actress enter the captain's quarters. The actress becomes a ghost and the producer is murdered. Finally, when two more convicts breach a closed door, they set the door on fire and a demon forms from the fire, killing them both. The remaining 3 learn that they are actually dead. The steward congratulates them for not breaking any rules, and then explains what is happening. Working together, the three retrieve the funeral boat on the cargo ship and set sail. More demons attempt to kill them. After one of them is sucked to hell, the others manage to get to land. They have no memory of the events on the ship. The last scene shows the steward explaining the rules to the next set of strangers, implying a continuous cycle of hell and death.
