By the time he is formally diagnosed with serious Alzheimer's disease, Kate realizes how much she doesn't know her family, having run from her past after the trauma of witnessing her mother's suicide at age seven. She decides to spend the remainder or her father's lucid moments reconciling with him and learning the things she never knew about her own family.
