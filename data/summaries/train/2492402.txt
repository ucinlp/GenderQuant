Puneet Sayal  is a copywriter with a dream: to earn enough cash to dump his job and live peacefully in Nainital. Till the said dream materialises however, he's living in Bombay with his girlfriend Agni . Things go asunder one day when he finds out his brother's been shot dead &mdash; a brother he's hardly acknowledged in the past. Agni finds out and, following an argument, throws him out of the house. Puneet goes on a drinking spree that leads him to a park bench where he witnesses someone being shot. He doesn't know it yet, but this is the end of his life as he knows it. He saves the injured man &mdash; a gangster called Vishnu  &mdash; and the act lands him squarely in the middle of Bombay's famed gang wars. The war between ganglords Ganpat  and Gangu  is a second thread in the film. Ganpat is the dominant kingpin, and Gangu is the perpetual second-in-place who's never given up her dreams of displacing Ganpat as top don.
