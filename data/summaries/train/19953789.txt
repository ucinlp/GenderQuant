During an intense summer heat wave in New York City, two cops are murdered and it's up to the detectives of the 87th Precinct to find the killer. Steve Carelli  and Mike Maguire  are the lead investigators on the case, but they can't seem to make any progress, and their work is made more difficult by a reporter, Hank Miller , who keeps sticking his nose in. The two cops try to keep their personal lives separate from their work, but it keeps bleeding through. When Maguire is shot and killed, Carelli has to comfort his partner's sexpot wife Alice , and then goes on a bender with the reporter, inadvertently revealing his suspicions about the case, and putting his girlfriend Teddy, a deaf-mute author , in jeopardy. When a hood  shows up at her apartment, Carelli overpowers him and forces a confession: he killed all the cops, but Maguire had been the intended victim all along, as his wife wanted him out of the way.
