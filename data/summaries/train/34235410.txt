In June 2008, the Benson family moves into 112 Ocean Avenue, Amityvillle, where Ronald DeFeo, Jr. shot and killed six members of his family in 1974. Tyler Benson, a teenage boy, uses his camcorder to record the experiences of himself, his two sisters and parents at the house, and some of the story is also told through CCTV camera footage, after cameras are installed in the house. Various unexplained events occur, culminating in the deaths of all of the members of the Benson family.
