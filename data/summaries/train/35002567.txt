This documentary is, first of all, a theatre piece entitled Afrikaaps within a film. It is based on the creative processes and performances of the stage production. Using hip hop, Afrikaaps, the film and the stage play, breaks ground by boldly attempting to reclaim Afrikaans&nbsp;– so long considered a language of the oppressor&nbsp;– as a language of liberation. Present from the very beginning of the project, Dylan Valley captures revealing moments of the cast's and production crew’s personal narratives that transcend what happens on stage.
