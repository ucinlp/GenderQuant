A troubled artist  is haunted by a ghostly young man  who appears to step right out of one of the artist's paintings. From a brief summary located on the cover of the film's script, it reads: a study of the illusionary reality world within the schizophrenic mind of the artist at his point of creativity.Michael Armstrong's Web Site
