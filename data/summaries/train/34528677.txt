Woody Woodpecker is a student in Mrs. Meany's  class. He arrives late to school, followed by his dog, Alfie. When Alfie follows him into the school building, he is kicked out by Mrs. Meany, who subsequently hits Woody on the hand with a ruler. Upon witnessing this, Alfie becomes angry, and bites Mrs. Meany on the fanny. Woody tries to go after him, but is barred by Meany, because "School's not out yet." Woody gets into trouble several times during the episode, and is disciplined by Meany, who makes him stand in the corner with a dunce cap on. After distracting the class, Meany attempts to discipline him with the ruler again, and is bitten by Alfie. Woody then rings the school bell, declaring recess. Meany chases him across the playground, and after Woody gives her a trick apple , the episode ends with Meany spanking him across her lap.
