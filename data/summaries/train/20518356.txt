Woody Woodpecker operates a babysitting service when he receives a call for a babysitting job. Woody is shown the baby's crib and, after the parents leave the house, rushes to the refrigerator, makes some sandwiches, opens a few bottles of Coke, and settles down to enjoy the evening TV show in solid comfort. Just as he is completely relaxed and enjoying himself, he hears the baby cry. He opens his Baby-Sitters' Manual and ascertains that when the baby cries, you give him a bottle. He prepares the bottle, takes it to the crib, and, to his consternation, discovers that he is babysitting baby gorilla. About to rush out of the house, he suddenly remembers the $50 fee, so he decides to stick it out. Following directions in the Baby-Sitters' Manual, he does everything in his power to get the baby gorilla asleep. The baby defies every rule, but Woody finally gets the baby asleep and settles down to await the arrival of his parents.
