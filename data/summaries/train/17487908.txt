Hard-drinking female detective Yukihira Natsumi  has the best record in the police force, but her independent personality and penchant to not go by the book has alienated her from colleagues, while her obsession with work has already cost her her marriage and custody of her eight-year-old daughter. Natsumi has no time for misgivings when there is crime to be fought. She is forced to reconsider everything she knows, however, when terrorists take over the hospital where her daughter is being treated. http://cgi.ebay.com.au/Unfair-The-Movie-Japanese-Movie-With-Eng-Sub_W0QQitemZ130356528018QQcmdZViewItemQQptZAU_Movies_Movies_TV_Shows?hash=item1e59dac392
