The film takes place in a world based loosely on Medieval Europe, where Sorcery is commonplace and people live in a feudal society. An evil wizard, wishing to conquer the world for his own, unleashes a seemingly unstoppable dragon onto the world to terrorize the peasant folk into submission. The creature can withstand any attack from humans, and appears indestructible. However, a small resistance movement has formed to defeat the wizard utilizing the strength of a fabled dragon believed to be the only creature in the land that can match the fire dragon in strength, and so the vigilantes set out in their quest for the dragon to save the kingdom.
