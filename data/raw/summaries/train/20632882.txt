Inspired by the legendary fictional character The Scarlet Pimpernel, the Pink Panther dons a red cape and a red hat with a feather, and becomes The Scarlet Pinkernel, protector of stray dogs. The first two dogs he saves from the dog catcher are anything but grateful, but the third dog, a large and cuddly one, gets too grateful and persistent, hops on the panther's motorcycle while he starts it, and blocks his view. The wild ride goes through a subway tunnel with a train in hot pursuit, and ends up in a telephone pole as the dog tries to chase a cat.
