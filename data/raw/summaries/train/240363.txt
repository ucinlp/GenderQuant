Phil Potter splits with his wife, Jessica. She wants to begin a singing and songwriting career and she also has been having an affair. Phil moves from New York to Boston, where his brother Mickey and sister-in-law Marva live. Against his wishes, they set up Phil with a blind date, Marilyn Holmberg, a nursery-school teacher working on her master's degree. He begins a new life. Phil takes a part-time teaching job and attends a divorced-men workshop in a church basement, meeting lonely men like Paul and Larry whose situations are similar to his. Marilyn feels it's too soon following his breakup for Phil to begin a new relationship. He goes on a date with her friend Marie, a single mom who literally throws herself at him. The longer he is apart from Marilyn, the more he wants to be with her. They become lovers and their relationship grows, although Phil seems prone to panic attacks. On the day Phil finally invites Marilyn to move in with him, Jessica unexpectedly turns up at his apartment. She looks fabulous and has become a great success as a songwriter, although she is a decidedly off-key singer. At a family Thanksgiving dinner, a phone call from Jessica comes at an inopportune time. Marilyn overhears him telling Jessie that he is dining with his family and "a friend." Marilyn's feelings are hurt and she knows their relationship is at an end. Phil moves back to New York to be with Jessica again. But the more he is with her, the more he misses Marilyn. He returns to Boston only to find she is now dating a basketball player. Phil does everything he can, even disrupting a Boston Celtics practice, in an attempt to win her back.
