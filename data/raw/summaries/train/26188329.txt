After his wife dies, Sam Crockett honors her last wish by moving back to their native Texas with their two sons and Grandpa Firth. They have a farm there that is in serious disrepair. Neighbor and old acquaintance Rod Murray has become owner of a large ranch by marrying Averill Marshall. He hates poachers and resents Grandpa hunting deer on his land. He also is unhappy that Averill's sister Ann, engaged to a doctor, is developing a romantic interest in Sam. Sam needs money and does some fencing work for Rod, who is slow to pay him, leading to a fight. Grandpa suffers a stroke and Ann helps nurse him back to health. She knows that Sam still loves his late wife, but persuades him that they can begin a life of their own.
