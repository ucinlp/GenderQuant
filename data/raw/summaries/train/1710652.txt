U.S. Army Specialist 5  Tulsa McLean  is a tank crewman with a singing career. Serving with the 3rd Armored "Spearhead" Division in West Germany, McLean dreams of running his own nightclub when he leaves the army, but such dreams don't come cheap. Tulsa and his buddies have formed a band and perform in various German "Gasthauses", night clubs, and on an Armed Forced stage. In one bar, he even discovers the record "Blue Suede Shoes" sung by someone named Elvis on a jukebox. To raise money, Tulsa places a bet on his friend Dynamite , that he can spend the night with a club dancer named Lili , who is rumored to be hard to get. She turned down one other G.I. operator, Turk . Dynamite and Turk have vied for women before when the two were stationed in Hawaii. When Dynamite gets transferred to Alaska, Tulsa is brought in to take his place. He is not looking forward to it, but in order to keep his money, he must go through with it. McLean uses his Southern charm and calls Lili, "Ma'am." She at first sees Tulsa as another Occupation Duty GI. Then after a day on the Rhine, Lili begins to fall for McLean. Tulsa's friend Cookie falls in love, with Lili's roommate, Tina  from Italy. In the end, Rick and Marla's baby son Tiger helps Tulsa win the bet for the outfitâ€”and Lili's heart.
