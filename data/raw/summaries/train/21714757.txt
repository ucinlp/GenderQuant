A young and attractive girl, Sarita, lives with her wealthy father, aunt, cousin and maid. Her father hires a tutor to teach her with essay writing, named Arun. Arun and Sarita slowly fall in love, especially when she finds out he's a famous poet by the name of 'Rahee'. Her father is adamantly against the union because Arun is poor. He wants Sarita to marry the son of a wealthy man, Moti Lal. Furthermore, Sarita's aunt wants her to marry her nephew Ramu, also known as Romeo and gets him hired as Sarita's music tutor. Moti Lal then gets a letter saying that Sarita is not her father's legitimate daughter, and her birth, religion and caste are called into question.
