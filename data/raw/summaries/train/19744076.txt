Chintamani was based on the legendary story of a Sanskrit poet and devotee of Lord Krishna named Bilwamangal . Bilwamangal, a resident of Varanasi, was a Sanskrit scholar, who gets infatuated towards a courtesan called Chintamani , a woman of ill-fame. As a result he deserts his wife. His attraction towards Chintamani eventually draws Bilwamangal closer towards Lord Krishna and transforms his life forever. Bilwangal, himself, becomes a devotee of Lord Krishna and pens a monumental Sanskrit work Sri Krishna Karnamritam.
