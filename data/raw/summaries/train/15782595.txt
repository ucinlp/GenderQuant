Thomas "Tom" Rosner  is a successful lawyer and happens to be a good catch. However, his unmarried state is the greatest sorrow of his mother, Helen , who is a cancer patient. As Helen visits the hospital for a check-up, she encounters her doctor's new nurse, Jane Cronin , a single woman who is hesitant to meet someone new after getting out of a five-year relationship. She is taken by Jane's beauty, compassion, intelligence and sense of humor, and immediately decides that she is the one for her son. Helen plays matchmaker between the two of them, much to the chagrin of her longtime caretaker, Katie Beale . Tom and Jane decide to humor Helen by going out on a date, but Tom is wrong in assuming that Jane likes him. In turn, Jane tells Helen that her date was "the worst social experience since the dawn of man." Undeterred, Helen manages to convince Jane to go out with Tom again. The second date goes successfully, but this time, Tom is afraid to commit because he feels he isn't the kind of man Jane's looking for. Helen succeeds in making her son see Jane again by employing jealousy, but just as things are going well between the couple, she learns that her cancer is back. This fuels her determination to finally get Tom to settle down with Jane, which frustrates Katie into telling her that she is meddling so much with her son's life that she is not allowing him to move on and live it on his own. Meanwhile, a torn-apart Tom goes back to his old ways and meets a girl at a bar who he reluctantly takes home with him. Jane encounters the girl and flees Tom immediately. Tom becomes withdrawn and depressed, not only because of Jane, but also because of his mother's illness. Meanwhile, as Helen's condition worsens, she begins to realize that she is not going to be around forever to look after her son.
