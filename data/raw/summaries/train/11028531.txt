{{plot}} Jerry runs back to Topsy, who then grabs him. Tom returns and, realizing that his student has finally learned, shakes his hand, kisses him, and then pats him on the head as if to say "Good job you caught the mouse!". Afterwards, he holds his hand out as if to say, "Let me have him," but Topsy refuses and releases Jerry. Tom begins to chase Jerry, but Topsy trips him. Irritated, Tom grabs Topsy and begins to spank him. Seeing this, Jerry helps Topsy by breaking the tip of Tom's tail over his knee; Tom screams maniacally in pain and Topsy escapes. Jerry then runs on a carpet and Tom traps him by rolling it up. As Tom takes the carpet outside, Jerry escapes and even helps Tom throw the carpet  into a garden pool. Jerry runs back into the house and slams the door in Tom's face and closes the windows before Tom can get in, trapping Tom's fingers in the process. After the front door gets slammed in Tom's face, Tom decides to break the door down. He takes a few steps back to get a good running start, ultimately running towards the door at full force. Jerry sees this through the mail slot and quickly clears the way for Tom. Topsy then opens the door and promptly gets flattened by a barrelling Tom. Jerry then runs to the back of the house and stretches an innertube across two posts on the backyard deck. Still running at full speed, Tom plows into the innertube and get sling-shotted back through the house and through the mailbox with his backside hanging out. Jerry arrives with a 2x4 board and is just about to whack Tom when Topsy stops him. After petting Tom's backside gently, Topsy gives Tom a solid whack. The little kitten then takes Tom's hat, places it on Jerry's head, and the two buddies walk away, arm in arm. ("We're Off to See the Wizard", from the score of [[The Wizard of Oz
