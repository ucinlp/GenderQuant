Political and public pressure coerces the government into allowing two well-known reporters and their assistants limited access to the ultra-secretive Area 51. The group consists of 20-year news veteran Sam Whitaker; his camera-woman Mindy; Claire Fallon, an ambitious writer, journalist, and head of an acclaimed news blog called The Fact Zone; and her cameraman Kevin. The four tour the base and things go well for a while, but when one of the base's "occupants" attempts to liberate both himself and those of his fellow species, Area 51 changes from being a secured government facility to a place of horror.
