Rich and spoiled twenty something Jessie Montgomery  winds up in jail after a life of wild partying. Her father  decides he might have been better off without a daughter, and with that her "fairy godmother" Stella  appears and creates an existence where she must make it on her own. Jessie is then forced to find work as a maid for an eccentric rich couple . The film is an unusual variation on the Cinderella formula: the fairy godmother is not the means to a better life for the heroine but rather the nemesis. Stella is Jessie's primary obstacle to achieving her wish of regaining her old spoiled Beverly Hills lifestyle. In the end, however, through her experiences with the other people in the mansion  Jessie learns the true meaning of love, friendship, and self-respect. When she chooses the happiness of her new friends over her own, she is rewarded with having her old life more or less returned to her.
