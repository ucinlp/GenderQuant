Now, Jane has two months to find a guy to fit the lie, complete the guest list, and save face. If the series of miserable set-ups orchestrated by her well-meaning best friends Eloise and Amanda are any indication, Jane's in for big trouble. From first date to blind date, from double date to last date, the match game is on-and with millions of men to pick from, Jane is sure to find Mr. Right, right?
