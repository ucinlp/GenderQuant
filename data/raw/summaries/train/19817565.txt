The gang tries to clean off their clothes after being splattered with mud accidentally by a passing motorist. A "miracle" cleaning solution devised by Billy "Froggy" Laughlin works beautifully, but with one major drawback: The stuff stinks to high heaven! Froggy tells the gang that they would get used to the smell. They do get used to the bad odor to the point of being oblivious to it. The kids manage to empty out a bus trying to board it. They walk to school and get thrown out of the classroom due to their smell. Then, being free from school, the gang goes to see a movie called Don't Open That Door at the theater. The movie-house cashier notices their smell, but they head into the auditorium. Then even the actors on the screen cannot stand the smell and stop performing. They finally get removed from the theater and remove their clothes behind a tree.<ref namehttp://movies.nytimes.com/movie/226212/Mighty-Lak-a-Goat/overview |title2008-10-08|work=NY Times}}
