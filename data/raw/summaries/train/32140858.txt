Narrated by the Iron Master, the story takes place in the Iron Master's forge. Tiger Claw has just earned his name, and so Iron Master explains how the war between the Arashikage Clan and the Red Ninjas began, by telling the origin of the rivalry between Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow. The story is told in flashbacks, to the first time that Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow faced off against each other, when the Hard Master put them through four trials. The trials end with Storm Shadow joining Cobra, blaming Snake-Eyes for the demise of his family. Duke, who had been standing in the shadows with Snake-Eyes during the Iron Master's story, steps forward to tell Tiger Claw that someday Storm Shadow will learn the truth about his family, and be welcomed back into the Arashikage Clan. Storm Shadow then appears to challenge Snake-Eyes and Tiger Claw, who reveal that Kamakura and Jinx are there to back them up. Storm Shadow then reveals allies of his own, in the form of Slash, Slice, and Shadow Strike. The ninjas all battle in Iron Master's forge, until the villains finally escape. Duke then offers Tiger Claw membership in the G.I. Joe Team.
