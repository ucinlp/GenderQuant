Billy Kershaw, the son of a manufacturer in a small western town, comes to New York on business. He becomes engaged to wealthy Peggy Rice, a member of the modern jazz set, who prefers to "play the field" with other men. Sometime before, Billy had sent Jim Gorman to jail for theft, causing Gormans girl, Minette Christie, to leave town. At a fashion show, Peggy persuades Billy to buy her an ermine wrap, trimmed with rhinestones, which is modeled by a girl who turns out to be Minette. Billy realizes that Peggy is no more than a gold digger and breaks the engagement. Gorman shows up and attempts to kill Minette, for he believes she turned him in. Billy, however, defeats Gorman in a fight, and at the very last minute saves Minette from being gassed to death in her apartment. Billy comes to realize that Minette is the girl for him.
