The film follows a man, Jack , faking insanity in order to save his sister, Lily , who has been involuntarily institutionalized. The siblings soon find that the strange doctor at the asylum, Mr. Gianetti , has been testing an experimental compound, orphium, on the patients that seems to be turning them into flesh-eating zombies; Loomis , another patient, spreads the infection. The two siblings band together with a terminally paranoid man, Dave , and a helpful nurse, Nancy , in the hopes of finding a way out of the asylum. They are attacked by most of the prisoners and staff, who kill Nancy; while on the 4th floor, they encounter the doctor, who gives Dave an icepick lobotomy, incapacitating him; he attempts to get Jack too, but ends up being infected by Loomis. At the end of the film, as the two siblings are in a police car heading to the asylum to investigate, the officers  accidentally let the patients escape into the outside world. It ends with a panning shot, revealing the city below the asylum's hillside location. The secondary plot focuses on the affair between Charles  and Heather .
