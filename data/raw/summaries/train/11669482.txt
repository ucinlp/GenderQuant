It is based on the true story of Ed Gein, who skinned, disembowled, and dissected his victims. As a child, he was traumatized by his mother, a religious fanatic who taught him that sex was evil and that all women  were sinful. When he kidnapped 58-year-old Bernice Worden, the police came to Gein's farmhouse and found her dismembered body, as well as parts of at least 15 other corpses. The movie plot centers on Gein kidnapping the girlfriend of a sheriff's deputy and the race to rescue her, something that did not happen in the true story.
