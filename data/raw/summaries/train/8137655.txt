Despite its impressive history and its reputation, the international trading company Struan's  is in trouble. Overextended by the previous management, new Tai-Pan Ian Dunross  has had to issue public stock to improve the company's standing. Regardless, he is courting a private investor, American billionaire Linc Bartlett . Bartlett decides secretly to back Dunross' arch enemy, Quillian Gornt , who will stop at nothing to destroy Struan's. When Dunross realises that Gornt is suddenly strong enough to ruin the Noble House, he must urgently forge new alliances or reshape ancient ones. He romances Bartlett's second-in-command, Casey Tcholok . A subplot involves the missing half of an ancient coin. Whoever possesses it may ask any favour of the Tai-Pan. Half the coin is acquired by crime lord Four Finger Wu , who aims to ask the Tai-Pan to help him smuggle cocaine. Wu and Bartlett are killed in a natural disaster. Wu's son redeems his father's stolen half-coin for a highly-paid position in Noble House. Dunross gains access to the Bank of China, whose funding allows him to foil Gornt's scheme. Tcholok becomes head of Bartlett's company, allying the organization with Struan's.
