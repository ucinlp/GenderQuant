The story examines the adult lives of two onetime teen lovers, Ken  and Sylvia , who were from different social strata. Ken was self-supporting, working as a lifeguard at Pine Island, an exclusive Maine resort, while Sylvia's nouveau riche family stayed as guests of the owners, one summer between years at college. They went on to marry different people &ndash; as it transpires, entirely the wrong people. Ken's wife Helen  turns out to be frigid and shuts him out romantically, while Sylvia's husband Bart  becomes an alcoholic, gradually costing him the family fortune. Ken buries himself in the research chemist's job he finds after college, while Sylvia devotes herself first to charity work, then motherhood. The saving grace of each marriage is their children, Sylvia's son Johnny  and Ken's daughter Molly . Ken and Sylvia meet again on Pine Island after twenty years, with Ken now wealthy through his chemistry work, while Bart has turned his family's mansion  into an inn, which is failing. Johnny and Molly meet and fall in love, while Ken and Sylvia begin to cheat on their spouses with each other. Ken and Sylvia eventually leave their spouses and marry. Bart ends up being taken to a sanatorium for treatment of his alcoholism but not after Johnny and Molly visit him requesting permission to marry as Molly is pregnant.
