The film opens with an implied soft-core sex scene involving two teenagers who are camping in the wilderness of Okaloosa. A Bigfoot-like creature invades their campsite and kills the two. The next five minutes of the film play like a faux-documentary with a narrator, Dr. David Stone  explaining the story of the Bigfoot. The film then changes to a normal movie, and the father of one of the victims, Milton St. John  asks Stone, as the leading expert on the Bigfoot, to lead an expedition in an effort to capture the Bigfoot before it can kill anymore people. Stone does not want to capture the beast, but agrees to try to take photos and videos of the creature. The next day, Stone's graduate assistant, Wendy , convinces Stone to let her come along on the expedition. Stone agrees and takes Wendy into his office to show her some grainy footage he previously took of the Bigfoot. Stone and Wendy, along with four colleagues  depart in a van to begin the expedition, but stop along the way to ask directions of a guitarist, Crazy Joe. The group hike fifteen miles to their campsite. When they arrive, they set up camp and exchange monster stories. Stone and Wendy share a tent, where she confesses she has had a crush on him since she was an undergraduate. The next morning, Stone and Wendy discover the others have gone out looking for the beast save for one of St. John's hired hands, Dan. Stone leaves Dan and Wendy to look for the others, but Bob and Jay are killed. Dan assaults Stone and takes Wendy hostage for unexplained reasons. He ties Stone up and, with Wendy and Darlene at gunpoint, forces them through the forest. Stone escapes and encounters a group of Dan's henchmen, who he deals with. Dan abandons Darlene and Wendy escapes and finds Stone. Dan is killed by the Bigfoot while Stone and Wendy escape in a truck driven by Crazy Joe.
