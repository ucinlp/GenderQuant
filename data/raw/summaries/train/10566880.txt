The title character is an innocent housekeeper whose life is ruined by an invasive tabloid reporter and a police investigation when the man with whom she has just fallen in love turns out to be a radical bank robber. The film, unlike the novel, ends with a scene at TÃ¶tges' funeral, with his publisher delivering a hypocritical condemnation of the murder as an infringement on the freedom of the press.
