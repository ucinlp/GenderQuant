It is 4:30 p.m. at a busy office. Irritated by the sound of a ball pen being clicked on and off, a Sales department worker grabs his Nerf blaster and shoots at the I.T. department worker holding the pen. Another I.T. worker "guns down" a Sales worker on the other side in retaliation. This results in both I.T.  and Sales  departments rushing to their lockers and arming themselves with Nerf blasters to battle each other. For the next 30 minutes, both sides exchange dart fire with each other until every office worker is "killed". Then, when the clock strikes 5:00 p.m., everyone gets up and greets each other goodbye before calling it a day, leaving the janitor with an office littered with foam darts.
