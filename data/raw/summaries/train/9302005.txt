The six-minute clip begins with three bridesmaids killing time in a hotel room while awaiting Jodi, the bride, who they note is running a little late. They joke around and open a bottle of champagne. Two are seen, identified as "Jessie" and "Esther"; the camcorder operator is never seen nor named. Jodi arrives, slams the door and falls to the floor crying about her hair. The other women try to console her. She seems to calm down. They urge her to start getting her dress on. However, once she sees herself in the mirror she returns to her disappointment with her hair. After a skip where the camera is turned off, Jessie offers Jodi some champagne and reassures her things will work out. But the bride is still not convinced. After another break, the camera shows her cutting her hair. When she sees herself in the mirror, Jodi starts to cry again, and starts blaming Jessie for "letting her cut her hair". Esther and the camerawoman are amused; Jessie tries to make the best of the situation. After another cut, Jessie is trying to cut more of Jodi's braids off as all three bridesmaids try again to reassure her. Finally she sees the camera again and lunges toward it.
