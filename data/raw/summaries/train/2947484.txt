His daughter, Momomi, is twice as twisted as her father. Mikura and the Danger Service Agency are hired by a mysterious old man to kidnap Momokichi. But, during that attempt, they run afoul of Momomi. Before the resulting firefight, Momokichi dies when his head falls on a ventilation pipe. Now, Mikura and the D.S.A., have to come up with a new plan before they end up as Momomi's next victims.
