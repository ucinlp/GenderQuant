The film begins by studying the Zero Tolerance policies in public schools in the 1990s, which were designed to eradicate drugs and weapons at schools. By arbitrary application of this policy via unchecked authority, soon nail clippers, key chains, and aspirin were considered dangerous and violations of the rules. This policy, combined with Columbine-inspired fear, has resulted in kindergartners being suspended for using pointed fingers as guns in games of cops and robbers and students being suspended for having Midol and Alka-Seltzer. This policy has turned schools into Kafka-esque nightmares, absurd and demoralizing. Increasingly, issues once dealt with by the guidance counselor or a trip to the principal’s office are now handled by handcuffs and tasers in the hands of police.http://www.nhpr.org/node/29048{{dead link|date"huffingtonpost1">{{cite news|urlJonathan Kim: ReThink Interview: Cevin Soling, Director of the War On Kids |publisher 2010-03-29|accessdate"huffingtonpost1"/> Ritalin and other drugs are being over-prescribed. These strong drugs can have dire consequences, including suicide and murder. Some school shooters, including the Columbine killers, have used or been on these drugs. This film touches on an area almost completely ignored in any discussion of education - the genesis of compulsory education. Public schools are modeled after a Prussian system, one geared towards creating compliant soldiers.{{cite news|urlJonathan Kim: ReThink Review: The War On Kids - Education's Prisoners |publisher 2010-01-14|accessdate"cvillepodcast1">{{cite web|urlCharlottesville-Right Now: Cevin Soling » Charlottesville Podcasting Network |publisher2012-02-26 |accessdate"cvillepodcast1"/>
