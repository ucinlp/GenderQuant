Mickey leads a radio orchestra who performs the Light Cavalry Overture . The sponsor  loves the rehearsal, but come the actual performance, Goofy drops all the instruments under an elevator, destroying the instruments' sounds. Sylvester Macaroni hates it, but suddenly lightens up when he realises the audience loves it anyway. Clara Cluck is in the orchestra in the beginning "rehearsal" sequences but not in the actual performance at the end. Other characters appearing in this short are Donald Duck, Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar. At one stage, Donald is so fed up with the chaos caused by the wrecked instruments that he packs his things and leaves. Mickey, determined to carry on come what may, points a gun at Donald's head to get him back into playing. This scene is missing in some versions of the short.
