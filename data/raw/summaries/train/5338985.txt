Fingerprints is based on an urban legend out of Abilene, Texas that centers around a school bus full of children that was involved in a terrible accident with a train leaving all the children dead. According to the legend, if a driver stops his or her car, in neutral, on the same stretch of tracks now, the ghosts of the children will push it to a safe area. Some of the townspeople in the film even claim to have discovered fingerprints on the back of their cars after being pushed off the tracks . The movie centers around a teenage girl, Melanie , who has just finished rehab. She moves to her family's new home in the town of Emerald, where her father is a part of the crew constructing a highway over the old train tracks. Her sister, Crystal , tells her of the legend and she begins seeing the ghost of Julie, one of the dead children and becomes more and more involved in mysterious occurrences in the town.<ref nameFingerprints  |work2009-09-13 |firstMahan |url2010-01-01}}
