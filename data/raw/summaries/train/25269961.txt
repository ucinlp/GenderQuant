A social drama plays out in the harbor area of Hamburg: Ballhaus-Else, a prostitute, lives together with her boyfriend Leo, a peaceful bar musician, in St. Pauli. One day, Matrosen-Karl, a thief on the run, finds a hideout at Else's. She is fascinated by the man, who promises her a more exciting and better life. Together they want to leave Hamburg. Leo – who feels inferior to Karl – lets them go with a heavy heart. But then Karl gets arrested after a fight between the underworld and the police in the Kongo-Bar, and Else returns to Leo – and her hopeless everyday life.www.cinefest.de/daten/2006/Filme%202006/Razzia_in_St._Pauli_pop.phpwww.kino.de/kinofilm/razzia-in-st-pauli/50635.htmlwww.filmevona-z.de/filmsuche.cfm?sucheNach20732www.kino.de/star/justin-rosenfeld/112762.htm The most important characteristic of this film is the use of local people, including those of somewhat gritty character, as extras playing parts that they actually lived at that time.
