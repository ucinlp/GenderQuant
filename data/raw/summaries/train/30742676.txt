Lynn  was married to Paul , but they split up on bad terms, and Lynn took custody of their daughter Alice  while Paul got their son Dylan . Years later, now that Dylan is getting married, Lynn is attending the wedding at her parents' estate, with her younger sons Elliot  and Ben  in tow. Elliott is a cynical substance abuser and Ben prefers to look at life through a camera than confront the world head on. Meanwhile, Alice deals with her anxieties through cutting; Dylan has only infrequent contact with Lynn; Lynn is fearful of Paul and his 2nd wife Patty ; Lynn's mother, Doris , blames her daughter for her family's many troubles; and her father  is in poor health and hardly cares what's happening around him. To the surprise of no one, all this has left Lynn an emotional wreck, and she's not sure just how she's going to get through the day.{{allrovi movie}}
