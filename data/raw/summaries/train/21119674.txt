Log Line: A life shattering tragedy sends three people on vastly different paths to a similar goal of redemption and understanding. One year ago while on duty as a plain clothes cop, Julian Varone gunned down an unarmed teen. In that time Darralynn Warren, the teen's mother, has spiraled into a pit of despair, while his brother, Dre, has gone another route... ganglife. As for Julian, it's time for him to get back to work. It is a story about redemption, injustice of poverty, the cycle of violence and how these three lives, affected by a terrible tragedy, cannot find closure without the other.
