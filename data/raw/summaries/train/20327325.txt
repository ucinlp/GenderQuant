In a marginalized New Orleans still trying desperately to recover from hurricane Katrina, a private investigator on the fringes of society reluctantly investigates two murders – one present day, one thirty years old. But even as detective Jack Spade encounters ancient French Quarter jewelers, shifty bayou drunks, rich uptown socialites, mysterious street prostitutes, exotic voodoo fortune tellers, corrupt police lieutenants and homicidal Mardi Gras jesters - none of whom he can trust individually – he can’t continue to ignore the mounting evidence that his father may have been involved in both crimes. Ultimately, the only way for Jack Spade to discover the truth may be to unlock the secret of four identical paintings each depicting four playing cards - the three of diamonds, the king of clubs, the ace of hearts, and the jack of spades.{{cite web}}
