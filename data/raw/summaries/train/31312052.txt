Boy Willy  and his friend Lymon  travel from Mississippi to Pittsburgh, where he wishes his sister Berniece  to give him the family's heirloom piano so that he can sell it to buy land from Mr. Sutter , a descendent of the family that once owned Willy's own ancestors as slaves. The piano itself had at one time belonged to the wife of the original Sutter, the white former owner of their family... and decades earlier, Berniece and Willy Boy's grandfather had, at the slave master's instructions, carved the black family's African tribal history and American slave history into the piano's surface. When Boy Willy arrives, his Uncle Doaker  tells Willy that Berniece won't part with the piano. Berniece's boyfriend Avery  and her Uncle Wining Boy  also attempt for reasons of their own to get Bernice to sell. As selling the piano would be like turning her back on their people and their past, Bernice continues to refuse.
