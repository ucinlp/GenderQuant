Two young college students, Phil  and Pete , compete for the love of pretty girl named Mary , and also to win the $1500 prize in a song-writing contest to write the best show tune for the annual college revue. The two men each ask Mary to sing for them, but eventually, she chooses Phil as her beau, and it is he who also has the winning song. Although the film was largely devoid of much plot line, as was typical of musical review pictures of the period, there is a great deal of singing and dancing. Many of Lois Moran’s numbers were actually footage that was cut from the film Fox Movietone Follies of 1929, which were edited out when the film was found to be too long. This film was created to make use of the deleted scenes, and so was fashioned around Lois Moran’s singing talent. Songs include: "Too Wonderful for Words" , "Stepping Along" , "Shadows" .
