Dan and Laura Miller  have been married for several years, but their relationship begins to change when their only son, Adam , loses his hearing at the age of four. At first his parents accept this change because Laura is deaf herself. Though later, Dan begins to explore the idea that with a surgical procedure and cochlear implants his son may be able to hear once again. A rift forms between Dan and Laura when Dan starts to favor the procedure and Laura and her deaf parents oppose it. Soon what opens up is a larger issue of deaf pride, also ethical issues around Cochlear implants and its effect of the deaf culture, as Laura's father Max, a deaf pride advocate, puts it, "The majority always thinks each minority wants to be like them", as he doesn't consider deafness a disability, and hence remains against the implants. Dan on the other hand sees this a deaf prejudice against him, and hearing people, when he simply wants to give his son a better future. Soon, they take the dispute to a child custody hearing, but in the end decide to work it out on their own and stay a family.Sweet Nothing in My Ear Variety.<ref name10976 Sweet Nothing in My Ear] The Hollywood Reporter.Overview New York Times.
