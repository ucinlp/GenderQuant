Inspired by a 1906 poem from early African American writer, Paul Laurence Dunbar, the unique drama explores aspects of Black culture in both turn of the century and present day Chicago in two parallel love stories, both about the relationship between a deaf woman and a hearing man. The narrative revolves about two couples, Malindy and Arthur, and Malaika and Nico, respectively taking place at the beginning and end of the twentieth century. Both pairs revel in the splendor or romance and a possible lifetime commitment only to be forced to deal with the dreaded disease of their difference times: tuberculosis and AIDS. The multi-layered film tackles various issues that arise in the relationship of the "mixed" couples.Compensation Press Release.
