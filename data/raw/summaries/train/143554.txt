Different kind of sitcomCatchphrases The show had several catchphrases used throughout its entire run, the most notable being "Hey now", a phrase Hank repeats in the opening credits of the fictional talk show, and whenever he greets someone. In one episode, Hank says he invented the phrase when he accidentally said it to someone and liked it. In 2007, TV Land ranked "Hey Now" as the 87th Best Television catch phrase. "No flipping" is a phrase Larry uses to go to commercial breaks, encouraging the at-home audience not to use their remotes to flip to another channel. In the series finale, the last thing Larry says on his fictional talk show is, "You may now flip". "See you out there" is another catchphrase commonly heard throughout the show, typically used as a parting phrase to imply the person will be seen on the show, or at some other time.
