During World War II and a few months prior to the Normandy landings, Gus Lang, an Allied agent, is sent to occupied France in order to rescue an "overlord" captured by the Germans - one of the key people with intimate knowledge of when and where the D-Day invasion will actually occur. Several people will help him to succeed: a secret friend of the Allies, a vital German officer who is a highly placed mole, and the French resistance. The SS, however, will try to block their plans.
