Born with the plain name Gencho Gunchev and with the soul of an adventurer, he cannot settle with the daily grind of a clerk. Using his charm, Gunchev begins relationships with rich women and after that disappears with their money. Pretending to be the famous freelance architect Yastrebovski, he wrings a huge amount of money out of a group of na√Øve people. The swindling is caught in a bar where he squanders the money of those people. Despite he is well-known to the police with all his reincarnations , he manages to provoke sympathy in the inspector in charge . Simulating illness, Gunchev is hospitalized, and in the hospital he manages to forge his death certificate. Then he goes to Bourgas in a search for his next victim. There he meets the intelligent and sensitive teacher Boryana and they both fall in love with each other. But soon, realizing he will be caught, Gunchev escapes from Boryana, taking only a picture of her. Again in Sofia, not without the help of providence, he manages to steal a uniform of a police captain. By accident he catches a man  who has an illegal workshop in his house. Gunchev accepts the bribe from Sedlarov and, true to his nature, offers to marry his daughter, Sevelina. Under the name Iliya Burevestnikov he blackmails all illegal private contractors in the area and incidentally comes across one of his ex-wives. His identity is uncovered and he finds himself again in custody. The only thing he requests from the inspectors before going in jail is the picture of Boryana.
