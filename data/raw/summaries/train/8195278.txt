Buster kills Marino by throwing the spear right into his chest when he was about to kill Hank. A month later, Hank gets a job as a tour guide in Texas, while Buster visits him and tells him he has his job back as a policeman. They shakes hands as both men realize they have better futures Buster drives off as Hank waves good-bye.
