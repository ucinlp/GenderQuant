Bill Forrester , a Canadian pilot serving in the Royal Air Force in Burma, flies a de Havilland Mosquito, a two-seat fighter bomber. Forrester is emotionally distraught after losing his new wife in the ‘’Blitz’’ in London and has become self destructive, seeking to end his life in action. "You'd think that would be easy in a war", he explains to a Burmese woman, Anna, "but I just kept getting medals instead." With Anna's support, Bill begins to recover his emotional stability. Forrester and his navigator, Carrington , on a routine non-combat flight to Myitkyina, with Flight Lieutenant Blore  as passenger in the Mosquito's bomb bay, is forced to go down in a remote desert area of Burma's central plain. When the three men struggle to survive in the hostile environment, the self destructive Bill finally realises that he can depend on support from others and that he may have someone to live for. Blore, however, abandons them and commits suicide.
