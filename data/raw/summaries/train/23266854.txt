The peaceful and happy life of Walker and Col Kennedy is interrupted when Kim, a brilliant and attractive male architect, builds a dream house next to theirs. All the people who move into the house turn evil or end up having "accidents" and unexplainable deaths. They realize that the house targets their fears and feeds off of them until it drives them insane. In the end, the Kennedys succeed in destroying the house, killing the architect in the process. In the final scene another couple is seen eyeing a new house identical to the old one. This is the greatest departure from the novel, in which the Kennedys kill the architect before trying to destroy the house &ndash; in the epilogue it is revealed that they themselves lost their lives and the house is still intact.
