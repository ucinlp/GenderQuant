Prickly, Grotke and Finster head home during a snowstorm and remember the times with T.J. and the gang. When they get stuck in a snowbank, Prickly blames it on T.J. and the gang, although Grotke says there is a logical explanation over that, considering that T.J. and the kids are not around the snowbank. As Grotke and Finster tell their stories about their experiences with T.J. and the gang, they are rescued, from where they are trapped, by T.J. and the gang, and Prickly admits T.J. and the others aren't so bad, to which Finster agrees, saying it really makes her feel more warm and fuzzy than before. The film ends with T.J. and the gang singing their version of Jingle Bells, describing about their classmates and teachers.
