About a dozen people, both Men and Women can be seen having a snowball fight in the middle of a tree lined street in Lyon. A cyclist rides along the street and becomes a target for those throwing snowballs. As a result he falls from his bike. He is not hurt, however and picks himself up, riding off to 'escape' back in the direction from which he came, but leaving his hat in the snow.
