A group of refugees from the Congo are stuck in Rabat, Morocco. The Spanish borderline stops them from entering Europe. In a room on the outskirts of the city they rehearse a theatrical piece based on their own experiences. An imperfect, unfinished staging. Real life and the stage are all mixed together. Apollinaire tells us, face to face, about the never-ending journey with an uncertain ending. Television images show us how many emigrants are expelled into the desert, forced to start their journey once more. Faces whose names are lost. Behind them, the empty spaces of what has already happened. Silent tracks that tell a story the same as ours.
