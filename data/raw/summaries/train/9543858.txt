Jimmy Starks  is a smooth-talking salesman certain heâ€™s on the verge of a big break, but when his car stalls in the middle of nowhere, a soothsayer named Vacaro  turns his world upside down. Slick salesman Jimmy Starks  has auto problems in a small New Mexico town and while his car is in the shop he visits low-rent fortune teller Vacaro  to pass the time. The supposed seer tells him he will have good fortune soon, but looking deeper relates the information that his future is blank, and he is safe only until the first snow of winter beyond which there is no future to foretell. The act upsets Jimmy and rekindles old transgressions and makes him feel he is on a collision course with destiny especially when an old friend Vincent  returns from a jail sentence that he went to in Jimmy's place after a bad business deal. Jimmy becomes obsessed with knowing more of his future and re-visits Vacaro but the old man can only tell the salesman that he has related to him all he can see. Jimmy feels that Vincent has returned to kill him and that he must do something to change the course of his future but Vacaro convinces him to accept his fate.
