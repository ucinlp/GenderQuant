The Gruffalo tells the tale of a mouse who takes a walk though the woods in search of a nut. Encountering three predators who all wish to eat him - a fox, an owl and a snake - the plucky mouse has to use his wits to survive. He announces that he is meeting a monster with terrible features, a ‘Gruffalo’, and the three predators are each panicked into running away. Mouse is now increasingly confident. There is nothing that can touch him in these woods. Until he rounds a corner and comes face to face with the extraordinary product of his imagination: the Gruffalo itself. Once again Mouse has to dig deep to escape the danger. Finally safe, he finds a nut, and can eat it in peace.
