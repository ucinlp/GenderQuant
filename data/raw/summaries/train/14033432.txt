 ManBand! is the tale of two music promoters looking to find the next big thing in pop music for television. They inadvertently create a "manband", a boy band with middle-aged men. The television company follows and sabotages their progress. The band, cruelly named ‘Parazone’ , consists of five members: *Barrelman , an opera singer; *RS Smoothskin , who has boy band looks but no talent; *Mild Bob , a Tupperware salesman who mistakenly auditions thinking it to be a Tupperware convention; *Bosco Barret , an “Irish lunatic/Troubadour; and *Bartender , a bartender/crazed heavy metal singer. Their choreographer, TT Bags, is a less than successful dancer and songwriter Lun E. Tune is a recently released mental patient who writes songs about maiming his old girlfriends.
