Sarah Polley plays Harper Sloane, a misfit in her snobbish and upperclass family, who has just gotten accepted to Harvard. At her sister's wedding, after being sent out from her hiding place in the storage room with a bottle of champagne, she meets Connie Fitzpatrick , a bohemian photographer who takes an instant liking to her and nicknames her "Guinevere". Her visit to his flat in order to pick up the wedding photographs soon blossoms into a full-blown affair, and Harper eventually moves in with Connie as he instructs her in the ways of art, in particular photography. After a brutal confrontation with Harper's mother , and Harper's discovery that Connie has a history of relationships with young women, the film comes to a climax in a downtrodden L.A. hotel, after a tumultuous five year relationship between the two of them, when Harper knows it is time to leave Connie. She returns only once, as he is dying from cirrhosis of the liver, and meets the other Guineveres he has had. But she is the only one who stays with him as he dies and describes his personal view of heaven to him, which she affectionately titles "The Connie Special".
