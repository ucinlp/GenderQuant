Yasha Mazur  is a turn-of-the-20th-century Jewish stage magician, conman and mystic. He tours through eastern Europe for his show while at the same time destroying his own career progressively through his personal problems. Nearly everywhere he goes, Yasha has a local girlfriend, from the youthful Zeftel , to the feisty Elizabeta . His burned out manager/impressario Wolsky  arranges for him to have one more chance at theatrical success, which requires that he pull off a never seen before trick in a Warsaw theater.
