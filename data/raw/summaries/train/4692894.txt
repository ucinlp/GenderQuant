The film is inspired by a novel "Uchi Veyyil" written by Indra Parthasarathy. The film revolves around Ambi, a young man in his early thirties. Ambi arrives in Kumbakonam from Delhi to see his ailing father, Vembu Iyer . His father, an orthodox religious scholar, revered for his knowledge in vedic studies, is now ill, having only his memories to accompany him. The state of his father is a shock to Ambi. The two fell out over Ambi's love and subsequent marriage to a Christian girl Sweetie in Delhi. Barely able to recognise his son now, Vembu Iyer ponders in total silence, as Janaki , Ambi's mother, shares with her son what has happened since he left for Delhi. Over time, he overhears his father mutter the name of Ambi's stepmother Avayam . Before his marriage to Janaki, Vembu Iyer intensely loved Avayam, much to the anger and diapproval of Vembu's own mother, who hated her daughter-in-law as she loved to dance. Eventually, Avayam and Vembu separated because of the pressure. Beginning to understand that guilt might be a reason why his father has retreated into silence over his own marriage, Ambi suggests bringing his stepmother Avayam to the house. Janaki, a traditional, submissive woman by nature is upset by the proposition, becoming frustrated at the prospect of sharing her husband with another woman. Eventually, Ambi's friend Murthy helps to reach a solution.
