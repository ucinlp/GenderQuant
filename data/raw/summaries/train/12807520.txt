The film involves a plot by a present day  Mafia don  to avenge the killings of a group of Mafia dons back in 1931  with a bold nation-wide counter-strike against most of the current Italian and Jewish syndicate heads using teams of Vietnam vets instead of Mafia hit men. Bronson plays a gritty, independent detective who stumbles across the plot when a washed-up former hit man is killed under circumstances that make it clear that it was an inside job and that Mafia were involved. He then slowly but surely uncovers the clues that point to a seemingly impossible plot. Who waits 40 years for revenge? Bronson's character is vintage Bronson; he is forced to resign from the NYPD after he shoots and kills an armed teenager. Later, after being hired by the LAPD he comes under scrutiny again after he runs over a suspect who has fired at him.
