In this sequel to the 1990 movie Class of 1999, the setting is still a violent future metropolis where gangs rule the hallways and themes like education and higher learning are a mere memory. Jenna McKensie is a young, sweet high school teacher who witnesses the killing of one of her students by gang member Sanders. Jenna wants to testify, so Sanders and his thugs try to intimidate her with threats and even going as far as to try to rape her. The principal cannot suspend Sanders without definite proof of wrongdoing, the cops have no evidence and Jenna's boyfriend Emmett wants to deal with Sanders himself, but Jenna does not want him to do that. Jenna starts to question whether or not suspending Sanders will improve the educational system or not. Enter John Bolen, a substitute teacher who believes in extremely strict discipline. Jenna takes a liking to him and feels she has found a friend who is willing to listen to her problems. John teaches Jenna that students should not be allowed to gain control of any situation in the classroom and that she must have a firm hand when it comes to teaching students. When Sanders and his gang try again to harm Jenna, John shows up in the nick of time and defends her from harm. John realises that Sanders and his crew have no respect for the faculty and decides to kill the gang members one by one. Then, Emmett and the local sheriff learn that an ex-C.I.A. operative named Gordon Ash is in town and is tailing John. It turns out that John is not an ordinary teacher after all: it seems that he believes he is the last of a group of cybernetic fighting machines who are programmed to teach students and discipline those who misbehave. But, in reality is only a human ex-soldier wearing body armor. As it happens, Sanders and his group are at the top of John's "Termination" list. But then, John starts to malfunction and starts to target almost everyone for termination, even Jenna.
