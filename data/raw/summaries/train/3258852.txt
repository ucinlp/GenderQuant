Shepard stars as Howard Spence, an aging, hard-living Western movie star, who, disgusted with his life, flees by horse from the set of his latest western filming in the desert outside Moab, Utah. He hits the road looking for refuge in his past, traveling to his hometown of Elko, Nevada and, eventually, to Butte, Montana, looking for a woman  he left behind twenty years before when he was filming a movie there. Spence is doggedly pursued by Mr. Sutter , a humorless representative of the company insuring Spence's latest film, whose mission is to return Spence to the set to finish filming the movie. Also converging on Butte is a young woman named Sky , returning her late mother's ashes to her hometown and conducting a search of her own.
