Opening with a shot of a statue of "the pioneer woman who helped win a continent", the film briefly outlines the way in which women could help prepare the country for the possibility of war. Among the various way women could help were: *working in a war materials manufacturing plant *sewing parachutes for US servicemen *attending free lectures on how to prepare nutritious meals on presumably rationed food *Joining the WAC or the Red Cross *donating blood There is also a segment on the types of costumes women would wear while engaged in war work. At the end of the film, the narrator explains women are vital to securing a healthy American home life and raising children "which has always been the first line of defense".
