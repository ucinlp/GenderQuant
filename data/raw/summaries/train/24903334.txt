Lars  decides to leave the army after accusations of having made passes at some of his men prevent his promotion to a higher rank. Disillusioned with the army and angry at his overbearing politician mother, he joins a Neo-Nazi group, discovering only later that they practice gay-bashing. He and his violently homophobic peer Jimmy  become involved in a secret love affair, moving from hostility through grudging admiration to friendship and finally tenderness and passion. Jimmy's emotionally unstable younger brother Patrick , already jealous that newcomer Lars quickly advanced above him in the Nazi group, discovers the relationship and tells Michael , the leader of the group, about it. They beat up Lars, forcing Jimmy to do the beating; but when the group leaves, Jimmy stays with Lars and takes him to the isolated Nazi safe house they had been sharing while they renovated it. As the two are preparing to go away together, a gay man whom Jimmy had beaten severely in the movie's opening scene emerges from the dark and stabs him. The movie ends with Jimmy lying unconscious in a hospital bed and Lars holding his hand.
