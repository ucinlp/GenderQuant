A group of scientists explores Siberia to find red-trimmed butterflies, but not allowed by the natives to go into a lake named Kitakami in the mountain because they believe it was the home of their mountain god: Jigoku-no-Sanjin, or Varan. They belittled the natives' story and get into the lake, but a roar was heard and they scream as green light shines and an explosion was heard. Further expeditions were sent, the "Mystery of the Centuries" group, was dispatched. But the groups also disappeared, and so, only one of them was left. He was Kenji Kogoro, a member of a scientific team. Actually, when he was still with his friends, a giant flying monster named Varan emerged from Lake Kitakami and attacked them. Kenji was the only one who survived the attack and only suffered a sprinkled arm. He was rescued by the rescue team send to Siberia to find the team. But, only Kenji who was left. Kenji, holding the photo of the monster and shows it to the government. The government knows it wasn't a joke and he gets ready if Varan attacks Japan. And it was right, Varan was reported by the local fishers who is fishing ashore. In the night, Varan surfaces and wreaks havoc. Varan was immune to gun and tanks, even electric fences can't stop him! Everything were destroyed, as everything were devastated heavily by the ferocious Varan. But Kenji knows what to do: drop bombs in Varan and he will take it. The bomb was set and they drop it, and Varan eats it. Three more bombs were drop and Varan eats them all too. Kenji says: "Eat that, fool." and Varan returns to the sea. They detonate the first bomb from Varan's body and Varan roars in the surface. They detonate both the second and third bomb, causing Varan to blow out. After that, they finally declare that humans are win, and Varan was dead. Everyone was cheering after the chaos, and as morning comes, human wins again and rise as the victor, once again.
