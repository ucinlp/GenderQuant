In the remote countryside of Ilongo, various women are sexually abused by local men. Two sisters, Tonya , a sexually repressed young woman, and Selda , a promiscuous woman, meet Simon , the most attractive man in the village. Tonya teaches catechism to the children of the village. Selda comes home from the city with her American lover, whom she throws out shortly afterward. She's the exact opposite of Tonya, as her views on sex are more liberal and less guilt-filled. Tonya is secretly sexually attracted to Simon, but she refuses his sexual advances.
