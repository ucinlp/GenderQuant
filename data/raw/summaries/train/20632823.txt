The Pink Panther is a responsible caretaker in a national park. One man and his dog comes to the park and he ignores a sign that says "no open fires" he chops it down and uses it to start a fire. Pink sees the fire and puts it out. He man comes back and sees the fire has been put out, he accuses his dog which the dog denies. The man then chops down a tree and sets it on fire. Pink sees this and puts his box of matches near him. The man thinking that his box of matches is fire wood puts the box in the fire. When he realizes this he gets a water bucket and puts it out. The ignores a sign that says no fishing and goes to the lake and fishes while littering. Pinks sees this and attaches his hook to a safe then pulls on the string causing the man's boat to sink. Pink sees that the man is littering again and holds up a sign that says "RED ALERT" to a woodpecker who then taps on a tree which wakes a sleeping bear. The bear sees all the trash and forces the man to clean it up. By nightfall the man is tired and he goes to bed, Pink then shuts down the park.
