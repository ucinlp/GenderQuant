Albert bets his friend Pierre he can seduce the first woman that Pierre might pick. The working girl Gaby happens to be the chosen. When Albert gets to know her he falls in love with her. At the same time he attempts to make a fortune by participating in a swindle about alleged "synthetic gold". But at the very day when the scheme ought to be accomplished, everything goes terribly awry and he is debunked. After that he has scarcely enough money left to buy a ticket to the United States for himself and his fianc√©e Gaby.
