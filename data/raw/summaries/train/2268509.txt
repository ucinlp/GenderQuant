Sixteen-year-old Lynda Mansell  lives in a small English seaside town in the early 1950s. She is feisty and precocious and always shocks other people with her vulgar and saucy tongue . She is also naive and easily taken advantage of. Bored with conventional jobs  and her town's dull young men, Lynda has her first sexual experience with Dave  but after she has slept with one of her father's middle-aged friends ([[Tom Bell , her life changes. She becomes pregnant and her father, a somewhat rigid and conventional man, disowns her. Desperately she tries to seek an illegal abortion but in the end decides to become a mother. "Wish you were here" is a sigh Lynda makes because of her dead mother, who understood her and protected her from her intolerant father. Beneath her cheeky exterior, Lynda is a vulnerable girl who seeks love and a place in life; she lives in a time when it was difficult for teenagers like her to do that in their own way. This movie was based loosely on the memoirs of the British madam Cynthia Payne as an adolescent. It was filmed in Worthing and Bognor Regis.
