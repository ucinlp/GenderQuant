In the city of Hamelin, there was a rodent problem as it kept spreading and eating all the food in sight. The mayor thought it was becoming a big nuisance until the Pied Piper showed up. The mayor offered to pay him a bag of gold for his services, or at least that what the Pied Piper thought. He used his pipe to hypnotize the mice to follow him out of Hamelin. Then, he made cheese with his pipe, tempting the mice to come in, and once all of the mice were in the holes of the cheese, he disappeared all of them and the cheese. When he came back, he got cheated and was only given one gold coin. The reason was because the mayor said that he was only blowing a pipe. Then, seeing how all the children were made to work hard and never have fun, the Pied Piper got revenge and got all of the children in Hameiln to go with him. The mayor and the adults thought he was bluffing, but it was true. Then he opened part of a mountain which led to a joyland for children with a fun playground and some candy as the Pied Piper and the children lived happily ever after.
