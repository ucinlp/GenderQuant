The film takes place in a small Iowa town in 1927. A traveling Chautauqua company arrives in the town, but internal squabbles create friction amidst the troupe. The new manager, Walter Hale , is trying to prevent Charlene, the troupe’s “Story Lady” , from recruiting the performers to form a union. Meanwhile, the town has a scandal following the murder of the local pharmacist Wilby . Although a shady gambler is arrested, Walter realizes that the real killer is Nita , one of Wilby’s employees. Walter successfully gets Nita to confess during a Chautauqua performance, where she makes public the sexual harassment that Wilby directed at her. Nita’s self-defense plea frees the wrongly jailed man, but Charlene is outraged that Walter used the crime to financially enrich the Chautauqua, and attempts to quit. Walter attempts to reason with Charlene, but when she refuses to give in, he deceives her and uses the local police force to be sure that she must leave on the train with the rest of the troupe.
