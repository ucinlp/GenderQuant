{{Expand section}} 1993 Made-for-TV movie with Rutger Hauer, Karen Allen, Eric Roberts. Another imitation of Dead Calm, this one is more successful than the others. I'll give you the negatives first. It's predictable, the bad guys are very one dimensional, and, like Dead Calm, there's a point where you'll be screaming at the screen, ranting for a modicum of common sense from the lead character. On the other hand, the lead characters have a lot more depth, and Rutger Hauer and Karen Allen portray a couple approaching middle age, with all the associated health and emotional problems, quite well. They're attractive without being blow-dried pretty. Despite its predictability , the story is actually pretty good, and it takes place mostly on the sailboat. The story line takes the boat and crew from Monaco to Malta in a series of short hops down the Italian coast, making good use of some beautiful coast , and good sailing. And the boat is utterly gorgeous; a sixty foot Chebec ketch named Charlie the Bird. All the deck scenes were done on the boat, most of the interior scenes looked like the real thing, and the sailing sequences are worth renting the movie for. Available VHS
