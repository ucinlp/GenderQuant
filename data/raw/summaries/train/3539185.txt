Su Fen, a young and frail girl, looked forward to her wedding with her fianc√©, Li Kuo-liang. The happy couple's bliss was cut short when war broke out. Kuo-liang was summoned to fight at the front lines. In his absence, Su Fen discovered she had tuberculosis. This did not please her mother-in-law who was looking for a healthy daughter-in-law to bear sons to continue the family name. She forced Su Fen to divorce her son and leave. When Kuo-liang returned on leave, he was angry and in despair for he still loved Su Fen very much. He went to look for her and was prevented from seeing her by her furious father. To his father-in-law, he swore his undying love for Su Fen, vowing never to marry another and left to return to the front lines. Su Fen suffered a lapse after failing to see Kuo-liang in time. Months passed and Kuo-liang returned to Su Fen's home to see her. However, her father had brought her out on a trip. Incidentally, Su Fen was returning that day and saw him as both their trains left and arrived respectively. At this second failure to meet Kuo-liang, Su Fen's illness took a turn for the worse. As the war drew to an end, Kuo-liang took a serious injury to his leg which left him half-crippled. After the war, he visited Su Fen once more.
