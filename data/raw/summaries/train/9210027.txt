Heiji Hattori searches for a girl he fell in love with after he saw her playing outside a temple when he was little. Meanwhile, Kogoro, Ran, Conan, and Sonoko go to Kyoto and meet up with Heiji and Kazuha to investigate a robbery and several murders. The killer tries to kill Heiji several times and severely injures Heiji. The killer kidnaps Kazuha, but Heiji collapses before he can reach her. Conan swallows a pill Haibara gave him and a bottle of wine, temporarily turning him back into Shinichi. He disguises himself as Heiji and attempts to arrest the killer and save Kazuha and manages to stall the murderer until Heiji arrives. Using kendo, Heiji fights the culprit while Shinichi runs into the woods to hide while his transformation into Conan occurs. In the woods, Shinichi bumps into Ran and stuns Ran with his tranquilizer watch to prevent her from seeing his transformation into Conan. Conan then reaches Heiji and Kazuha in time to save them by kicking sticks of fire at the culprit. The culprit continues to fight Heiji and manages to push the Osaka detective to the edge of the roof. Conan kicks a soccer ball at the enemy, giving Heiji time to regain his footing. In the end, Heiji finds out that the girl from his childhood was Kazuha and does not tell Kazuha that she is the girl he was looking for.
