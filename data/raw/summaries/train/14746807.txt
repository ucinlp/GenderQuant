The Stooges are trainers for the boxer Chopper Kane . Their boss, Big Mike , a mean-spirited prankster and mobster bets on Chopper's opponent, Gorilla Watson. He then tells the boys  to make the Chopper throw the fight or else.  The Stooges try to fatten up their boxer so he will lose against Watson. However, the boys have a stroke of luck when Gorilla Watson breaks his hand  on fight night. Unfortunately, their boss is not pleased and sends his goons after them. After the Stooges get some Stooge-style revenge on Big Mike, they are chased by his henchmen. Shemp manages to knock them out, but ends up knocking himself out as well. Moe and Larry try to revive Shemp but accidentally revive the goons, thus they take Shemp and flee the scene.
