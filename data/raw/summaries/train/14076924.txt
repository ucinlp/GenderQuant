In an isolated farmhouse, a woman named Dorothy Yates lives with her husband. Dorothy has just been released from a mental institution after it was found she was a cannibal who killed and partially ate at least six people in 1957. Her husband, Edmund Yates was convicted as well but we come to find out that he only faked his dementia in order to remain with his wife. He was a truly devoted husband who loved his wife dearly but really had nothing to do with the actual murders in 1957 and in the present. Now it is 1974 it seems as if Dorothy has had a severe relapse. She secretly lures lonely young people to her Haslemere, Surrey home, promising tea and a tarot card reading, only with the session ending with a violent murder and "feast". Jackie,  began to suspect her stepmum, Dorothy, rather early in the film and juggles her family ties while at the same time, trying to control her stepsister, Debbie . Debbie rides with a violent bike gang and has apparently inherited her mum's appetite for human flesh herself. Debbie became involved in a fight with her boyfriend and a barman after closing time near one of London's hip nightclubs. The bike gang leave when spotted by customers but Debbie hid the body in a car shelter before the police arrived. Debbie has severe arguments with Jackie about where Jackie goes at night. She learns  that Jackie has been visiting her parents in Haslemere. Debbie finds out where they live and she and boyfriend  flee to the countryside home to be reunited with mum and dad. They are a family again and plan to plot against Jackie, who kept Debbie from them.
