The pod contains “The Runaway,” a human slave played by Daniel Bernhardt. He is being pursued by cyborg slavers and dinosaurs that they use as “trackers.” Since he was kidnapped some time from Earth’s past, the Runaway is familiar with the English language and the King James Bible and he regards Earth as a literal heaven. The Runaway finds refuge with novice nun Sister Ann(Travis Brooks Stewart}, who's past involved dealing drugs and prostitution. Together, they fight the dinosaurs and their robotic masters, seeking help from a street gang.

After being arrested as a suspect in a rash of deaths due to strange animal attacks, The Runaway is interrogated by federal agents. They present to him a dinosaur collar found on the beach. The Cyborg Master, breaks into the police station during the interrogation and the Runaway manages to escape in the confusion. He returns to Sister Ann and her gang friends with aplan to attack the dinosaurs where they live, as Runaway simply explains, "Near water...". Using dynamite, Runaway successfully destroys a water treatment plant, killing the dinosaurs.

After Runaway finally kills the Cyborg Master, he becomes a counselor for runaway teens, working closely with Sister Ann.
