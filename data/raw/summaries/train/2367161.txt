Thomas Crown  is a wealthy financier who aches for a challenge. Despite all of his success in business , he feels bored. Among other diversions, he crashes an expensive catamaran while racing and bets $100,000 on a golf swing simply because "it's a beautiful Saturday morning", and there is not much else to do. In order to cure his boredom, Crown orchestrates an elaborate heist to steal a painting ([[San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk  by Monet, valued at $100 million, from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The insurers of the artwork send Catherine Banning , an insurance investigator, to assist NYPD Detective Michael McCann  in solving the crime. From the beginning, Banning suspects Crown is behind the theft. A game of cat-and-mouse ensues that results in their becoming lovers and gives Crown exactly what he was seeking, as his psychiatrist puts it: "A worthy adversary". To prove his sincerity and test her loyalty to him, Crown returns to the museum under the eye of Banning and dozens of police officers, vowing to put the stolen painting back.
