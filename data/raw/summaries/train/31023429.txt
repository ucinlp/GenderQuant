A minivan transporting ordinary citizens is stopped on a Burundian dirt road. With force a band of Hutu rebels armed with Kalashnikovs get the passengers off. The rebel leader barks:"Hutus to the left, Tutsis to the right!". The sorting fails as all hurry to the left and neither passengers nor rebels can distinguish Hutus from Tutsis.
