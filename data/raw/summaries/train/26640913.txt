Clay Lomax gets out of prison after serving nearly eight years. He goes looking for Sam Foley, a bank robber who shot Lomax in the back and left him to take the rap. Foley has a trio of hired guns, Bobby Jay Jones being the fastest and most vicious. Lomax offers an old friend, Trooper, all the money he has in the world, $200, for the name of the town where Foley can be found. A woman named Teresa Ortega has been keeping Lomax's money for him, so he sends for her. When the train arrives, a girl of age 6 called Decky gets off. Lomax learns that Teresa is dead and believes Decky could be his own child. He can't find anyone to look out for her, so Decky accompanies him on the search. Trooper is killed by Foley's men, but with his dying words reveals that Gun Hill is where Lomax needs to go. A woman named Juliana offers shelter to Lomax and the little girl. Jones and his men arrive and take them prisoner. To amuse himself, Jones shoots objects, ala William Tell, off the child's head. Jones shoots one of his partners by mistake, flees, then kills the other. He goes to Foley for his money, but when Foley draws a gun from the safe, Jones is too quick and kills him. Jones is enjoying his money when Lomax gets the drop on him. Lomax forces him to place various objects on his head and shoots them off. In the end, he makes Jones prove just how fast he is supposed to be. Jones is forced to place a cartridge atop his head. He tries to outdraw Lomax but can't and he is shot dead. A relieved Lomax rides back to Juliana and Decky to begin a new life.
