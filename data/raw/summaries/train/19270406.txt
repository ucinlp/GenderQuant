Eti is more like a routine love story where a bunch of college-goers get together, play pranks and make merry but are caught unawares — or rather with their pants down — by the subsequent twists and turns. By the end of it, Eti becomes a complex story too simply told. At the centre of all the action is Gourab, who plays the super cool Sanjoy in love with Shreya . The couple, along with two other couples and a still-single friend, plan a holiday in Darjeeling. The gang of friends  is meant to have a blast on the road but the foolish gags and lukewarm dialogues slacken the pace. Gourab and Shreya get cosy and make the mistake of recording their intimate moments on a handycam. The sequence is candidly filmed with Gourab caressing Roopali’s bare back as they make love on satin sheets. But the director does desist from turning the film into a sleaze fest.What had started off as a teen romance changes track post-interval. Things take an ugly turn when the teenagers get sucked into a porn racket. A giggling, squealing Roopali takes time to get under the skin of her character. Gourab does better as a mischievous fun-loving youth, except for the times when he bursts into tears as things go awry. Of the rest, Bhaswar tries to be the friend-philosopher-guide to his pals; his bright and chirpy lady love Sweta livens up things a bit. Swaralipi fits in as a silly romantic, while Dhruv, the guy without a girlfriend, is hardly funny.But the wafer-thin plot struggling to hold the chain of sensational events takes a toll on the film. The pedestrian treatment does not help matters. Digitally shot, Eti has the feel of a home video with shoddy editing and jerky camera movements.
