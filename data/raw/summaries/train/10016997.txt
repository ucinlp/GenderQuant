A farmer is busy with hoeing while his son Porky is ploughing the fields with his horse Dobbin. Hank Horsefly speeds up the process. The farmer and Porky are about to take a turn for the worst as Mr. Viper The Snake comes with a Mortgage form ready to evict them unless a sum of rent money is paid. Porky applies for a job as horse driving milkman with a strict condition not to break a single bottle. Porky is doing well until Hank having followed their trail, sends Dobbin going at full speed and crashing, causing all the milk bottles to break. As Porky despairs, Dobbin accidentally enters a horse race. When the race starts, Dobbin isn't getting far, until Hank kick starts Dobbin to overtake every racer and wins a $40,000 prize. Porky makes it to the farm in the nick of time, riding in a roofless limo. Porky pays the owed money to Mr. Viper and Hank gives him a kick.
