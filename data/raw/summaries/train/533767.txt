Chuck , formerly a successful stockbroker, has found a refuge from the ulcer-inducing Wall Street rat race in his job as an attendant at the New York City morgue. His displeasure at being "promoted" to night shift supervisor to make room for his boss's nephew is exacerbated by the irrational exuberance of Bill "Blaze" Blazejowski , his new coworker. However, both men are inspired by the plight of Chuck's prostitute neighbor, Belinda , to apply Chuck's M.B.A. education and Bill's entrepreneurial spirit to open a prostitution service with headquarters at the morgue.
