Kafka is straight while Daniel happens to be gay. The young men fall in love, believing that their love can bridge anything, despite their difference in sexuality and Kafka's drug-taking. Daniel does not regret his love for Kafka, who tries to love him back against his nature. But a flashback memory from Kafka's past makes it difficult for their relationship to work. It turns out that their addiction to love proves more fatal than the drugs they use to explore the boundaries of their friendship. The film stars Hong Kong Chinese actor and former model Byron Pang , who was a runner-up contestant for Mr. Hong Kong in 2005, and Thomas Price, a half Chinese-half British actor who appeared in Permanent Residence and City Without Baseball. Like Scud's previous films, Permanent Residence  and the earlier City Without Baseball , Amphetamine features full-frontal male nudity in many scenes, in among others, an outdoor fight scene in which Pang is stripped naked by other guys, gym showers, and a leap from a public building, in which Pang wears 'wings', and his whole body is covered in calligraphy and silver paint. Amphetamine examines the limit of passion, and is the second of a trilogy: the first, called Permanent Residence, examines the limit of life, while the third, known as Life of an Artist, examines the limits of art. Amphetamine was screened at the Berlin International Film Festival on 15 February 2010, and was also shown at the Hong Kong International Film Festival on its final day . The third film has not yet been released.
