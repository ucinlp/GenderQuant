Eventually Steve learns that the killer was a young man named Warren, who was himself killed three years previously, but Steve is unable to prove it.

He confronts her again, but she has come to the same realization about the murder. They rush off to alert the governor as the execution starts. They reach the governor just in time to save Frank.
