A Union cavalry brigade, led by Colonel John Marlowe , is sent on a raid behind Confederate lines to destroy a railroad and supply depot at Newton Station. Ironically, before the war, Marlowe had been a railroad building engineer. With the troop is a new regimental surgeon, Major Henry Kendall  who seems to be constantly at odds with his commander. Kendall is torn between the duty and the horror of war. Complicating matters, while the unit rests at Greenbriar Plantation, Miss Hannah Hunter , the plantation's mistress, and her slave Lukey  eavesdrop on a staff meeting wherein Marlowe discusses his plans. To protect the mission, Marlowe is forced to take the two women with him. Initially hostile to her Yankee captor, Miss Hunter gradually warms to him. In addition to Miss Hunter, Marlowe also has to continually contend with Col. Phil Secord who doubts Marlowe's orders and command decisions. Several battles later, including a fire-fight which results in the death of Lukey, and a skirmish with Boy Cadets from a local military school ,http://archaeotex.blogspot.com/2007/05/cinematic-license.html and with Confederate forces in pursuit, Marlowe and his command reach a bridge which must be stormed in order to access the Union lines. Dr. Kendall is forced to choose between remaining behind with some badly wounded men , or leaving the men without medical care until the Confederates arrive. Marlowe, wounded, is able to lead his troops over the bridge after they have set charges under it. First, he lights the fuse and the bridge blows up to halt the Confederates once again. He and his command continue on to their destination having successfully completed their mission. This is not shown but is understood. See below.
