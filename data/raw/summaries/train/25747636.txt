Dean Singer  has terminal cancer, yet is determined to spend his last days taking care of his 15 year-old 'big brother program' autistic protégé, Louis 'Zig Zag' Fletcher. Dean got Louis a dishwasher job in shamelessly abusive, exploiting Mr. 'The Toad' Walters'  restaurant. Louis' dead-beat, neglecting yet abusive dad pushes him for 'rent' , which Zig Zag gets by &ndash; stealing from Walters' safe, remembering numbers being his only talent. Singer is determined to return the money, despite excessive risks, with surprising allies.
