Nanhe  is the self-proclaimed best camel jockey in all of Jaisalmer. Only ten years old, he can speak a myrad of languages and has won the hearts of all the tourists who visit Jaisalmer. But who has won Nanhe's heart? His best friend, the actor Bobby Deol. No one believes that Bobby Deol is Nanhe's friend. When Nanhe's "sab se acha dost"  finally comes to Jaisalmer on a 30 day movie shoot, Nanhe's wish is fulfilled, to finally meet his long-lost friend and he learns a lesson on how to use his most powerful utility, his brain. Bobby teaches him how to fight with life, and do creative challenges but then he finds out at the end, it was all an elusion. Bobby never came to Jaisalmer, he cancelled his shooting, and only Nanhe could see him. As an adult Nanhe  changes his name to Vikram Singh and writes a book about his own life, how he thought he met Bobby Deol and the rest of stuff that happened in his earlier life, but is in big shock and excitement when he finds out that on his Book Premiere, Bobby Deol actually showed up, remembering they became good friends after all.
