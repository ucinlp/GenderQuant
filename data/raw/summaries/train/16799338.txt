When her husband George disappears after a flight up to northern BC's interior wilderness to search for gold, Andrea Spalding  contacts Jean Dupre  for help, who is serendipitously available for hire after intimidating a surly Mollyco corporate superior/passenger with aerobatics in a company Cessna 206, then landing, exiting and walking away from the aircraft as it continues to taxi onto an active runway with said superior still aboard and into the path of a landing Cessna 185. Together, Dupre and Spalding embark on their search in a neglected de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, along the way encountering a mechanical breakdown and gypsy fisherman Elijah , who earnestly urges them to stay away from "Headwater". On arrival at Headwater, Dupre accidentally crashes the plane during the water landing, yet he and Spalding survive, shaken but unhurt. From there the movie evolves into a plot of suspicious activities and a hermitous prospector , and then into a whodunit mystery/adventure, involving mistaken identities , the truth about Spalding's husband, greed and murder.
