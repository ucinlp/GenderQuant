Leaderless and heartsick over their losses, the cadets carry their vendetta for revenge against the Dutch to the high seas in a dangerous mission to Bali, home island of the maimed mute Dayan , where they are sent to kill the Dutch militia Colonel Raymer , who murdered the family of the band’s new leader Tomas  in the opening of RED AND WHITE. Facing the cannons of a Dutch PT boat, the hard-drinking playboy Marius  must overcome his fears as he rivals Tomas for the affections of the starchy aristocrat’s daughter Senja . Arriving in Bali, the band saves the woman Dayu  from the ravages of Colonel Raymer’s KNIL militia, but one of the heroes is nearly killed. As their friend hovers between life and death, the band finds the underground caves of rebel leader Wayan Suta . Tomas clashes with their former commander, Amir  as they plan a final assault against Raymer’s militia, raising the question: how far can the revolution go to defeat evil, and still retain its ideals?
