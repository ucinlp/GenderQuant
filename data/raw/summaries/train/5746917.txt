Michael soon finds his day going from bad to worse when he's caught up in a botched robbery at the convenience store he's now stranded at. The cops  show up ready for a gunfight. Michael finds himself trying to convince the gunman  to let him and the other hostages go, all while trying to plan how to get to the airport before Rae's flight leaves.
