Colonel Cooper  is a U.S. Airborne squadron commando who comes to Vietnam with a special mission to liberate imprisoned American soldiers. He gets caught in a North Vietnamese POW camp where there are other airbornes as well as regular soldiers. Action is set at the end of the war and he, as the highest-ranking officer in the POW camp, is to be sent to Hanoi and prosecuted by the North Vietnamese. Camp commander Vinh  gets an order to send him to court but instead of obeying it, he offers Cooper a deal - he will help him get to the American sector and then Cooper, in return, would help him immigrate to the USA, where Vinh has family. Cooper promptly disregards his proposition, as he's a tough soldier who would rather sacrifice his own life than help the enemy. However Vinh is persistent persuading him, threatening that if he'll not accept his deal, then all of the fellow prisoners from his camp will die. Given that threat Cooper reconsiders Vinh's offer, and accepts the deal, but under one condition - all of the camp prisoners must go with them. Vinh, being short of time  OK's the plan and so they leave camp in column of two jeeps and a truck . Their journey won't be without obstacles as they need to go through zones controlled by The North Vietnamese, and through the jungle wilderness.
