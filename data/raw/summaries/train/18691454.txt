In a forest dwells Grover Groundhog and today is Groundhog Day. Grover Groundhog does a dance with his shadow saying that his shadow means nothing in relation to the weather forecast. A radio broadcast prompts Grover to leave his burrow for photographers to see if his shadow appears or not. Upon leaving his burrow the cameras switch to guns  and begin firing at Grover, but he manages to retreat. Porky and his dog Mandrake are hunting for a groundhog as well. Mandrake's first searching attempt only has him retrieve a boot. While Mandrake lingers in the woods, Grover gives him a fright. Mandrake recognises Grover as a groundhog and begins chasing him . Grover starts scolding Mandrake and making a sad story. This makes Mandrake oppose Porky's hunting, until Porky snaps him out of it. Before resuming the chase, Porky's dons a pair of earmuffs on Mandrake, but Grover tells another sad story through a microphone into the earmuffs. As Porky scolds Mandrake, the dog pretends to commit suicide with a water pistol. Porky gives Mandrake a final chance to catch the groundhog. Grover tricks Mandrake into eating a bone so that Porky thinks he ate the groundhog. As Porky confronts Mandrake, Grover whispers a sad story to pass on to Mandrake. Mandrake snaps Porky out of his tears and Grover runs off. All three of them rush into Grover's home and switch their fighting into shadow boxing.
