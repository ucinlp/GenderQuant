Brother Jim Jefferies leads the "Congregation of the Cross" in the small West Texas town of Britten. To be sure his children never falter, Brother Jim relentlessly reminds his congregation of the dire consequences, should one stray from the Lord's word. Temptation, however, can be great, and when sin is in the heart, a young man finds himself damned for all eternity, thus leading himself, his best friend, and his friends brother, on a cross country journey to avenge God's will. Arriving in Los Angeles, they meet a cunning con man. Together, the four young men find themselves in the middle of dangerous street games that finally lead them to perpetrate the ultimate sin; or had the sin already been committed?
