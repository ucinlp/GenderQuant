Marcia  is a single mom and street vendor barely scraping by even with a financial assist from the seemingly avuncular Larry , a gun-toting strongman with a twisted desire for Marcia's teenage daughter, Tanya . Complicating things is Priest , a murderous hood who killed Marcia's friend and now is terrorizing the defenseless woman. Facing three big problems--Larry, Priest, and a lack of money---Marcia arrives at an inspired solution: develop an alter ego, a dancing celebrity called the Mystery Lady who can compete in a cash-prize contest and put both of the men against one another. Which is exactly what she does, and it's great fun watching Marcia instigate her complicated plan with a little help from sympathetic friends.
