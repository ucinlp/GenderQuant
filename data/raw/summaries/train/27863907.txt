But when his old friend from the chemical institute, Yuri Lebedev  arrives in Moscow from the Siberian city of Dalnegorsk, along with a traveling companion, Olga , Bochkin becomes uncomfortable with his job title. He decides to tell his friends that he is a scientist working on top-secret experiments for the government, but eventually this cover story backfires, leading to one misunderstanding after the other.
