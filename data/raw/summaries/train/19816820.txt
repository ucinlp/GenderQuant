Determined to uncover the identity of the mysterious leader of a juvenile extortion racket, the gang sets up a crusading newspaper called The Greenpoint Press. The kids gratefully accept the help of a pleasant, well-spoken youngster named Frank, little suspecting that he is the duplicitous boss of the dreaded Gas House Gang. Only after Frank's henchmen have taken Froggy for a "ride"  are the kids able to expose the villain and save the day.
