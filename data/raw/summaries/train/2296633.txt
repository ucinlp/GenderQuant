The film centres on a group of colleagues in downtown Calgary, Alberta, who bet a month's salary on who can last the longest without going outside. The film takes place over one lunch hour during the course of the month long competition. The dark comedy often uses surrealism to achieve its goals. The cast includes Fab Filippo, Don McKellar, Marya Delver and Michelle Beaudoin. The film's title is derived from a particular form of suicide where one smashes the  window of one's high-rise office and then jumps through. Many people go "downtown", but such folks go "waydowntown". In the movie, one of the characters has accumulated a 2-litre pop bottle full of marbles in the hopes of breaking his window.
