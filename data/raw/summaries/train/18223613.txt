It's Pluto's birthday, but Mickey's nephews prefer to amuse themselves. The children receive a small cart, and treat Pluto like a workhorse. Then, they decide to play to see who can catch Pluto's tail. Eventually, they gobble up all of Pluto's birthday cake and leave. Pluto, understandably upset, angrily throws a tantrum, knocking away all the dishes until Mickey passes him one last slice of the birthday cake he saved. Pluto, happily eats the cake, licking Mickey between bites to show his gratitude.
