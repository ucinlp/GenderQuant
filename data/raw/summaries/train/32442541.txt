The first part of the movie is about the hero and the heroine falling in love and getting married. Then the story from the song starts. The husband and his friends decide to go on a pilgrimage to Silu. When the wife finds out about the plan, she insists on coming too. He reminds her of the tradition that it is not done, and that it could lead to their separation. But she tags along with them, and the party reaches Silu. On the return trip, the wife is kidnapped, the husband's friends desert them, and he rescues her with the help of a passing holy man after a big fight.Grandin, Ingemar  Music and Media in Local Life: Music Practice in a Newar Neighbourhood in Nepal.
