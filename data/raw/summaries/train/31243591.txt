The Cantones are a bourgeois family who own a pasta factory in Lecce in the conservative Southern Italy. One of the two sons, Tommaso , returns from his studies in Rome and hopes to make the most of a family reunion to reveal his homosexuality. Tommaso discusses his plans with his elder brother, Antonio , and also tells him about his desire to break away from the family business to become a writer in Rome. During a dinner with the Brunetti family, with whom the Cantones are in business, just as Tommaso is about to share his news, Antonio interrupts and reveals to everyone that he himself is homosexual. Mr Cantone , the brothers' father, takes the news badly and is admitted to hospital. Rejecting Antonio, Mr Cantone decides to place Tommaso in charge of the family business. Tommaso changes his mind about revealing his homosexuality, as he thinks it could kill his father, and accepts. Life is made more difficult for Tommaso when his boyfriend, Marco , decides to visit him at his family home along with various other friends from Rome.
