The gang reside at the Happy Home Orphanage, an inaptly-named organization run by the nasty and dishonest Mr. ([[Clarence Wilson  and Mrs. Crutch . Invited to a garden party at the home of wealthy Mr. Wade, the children enjoy a good time and are showered with gifts, though they know full well that their new clothes and toys will be appropriated and sold by the Crutches once they return to the orphanage. Meanwhile, Mr. Wade's daughter Mary  and her boyfriend Dick  stumble upon a magic lamp, which grants them their wish: to be children again. Dick and Mary are summarily rounded up by the Crutches and bundled off to the orphanage, where they manage to get the goods on the underhanded operation. Spanky has some funny scenes where he refuses to take a dose of castor oil and instead pushes it into Mr. Crutch's mouth. During a sleepless night, Spanky helps Dick escape out the window. Dick runs to Mary's house where he finds the lamp and wishes he was an adult again. He then returns to being an adult and leads Mr. Wade back to the orphanage, exposing Crutch and restoring Mary to adulthood. Spanky has his revenge on Crutch by using the lamp to wish him down to his size, then beating him up.<ref namehttp://movies.nytimes.com/movie/225676/Shrimps-for-a-Day/overview |title2008-09-20|work=NY Times}} {{clear}}
