Six friends come together to try to find fame and fortune by making the world’s most innocent adult movie ever made. Although they have literally no idea what they’re doing, they keep at it and are determined to accomplish their goal...no matter what gets in the way. After the clueless crew ultimately does make a porno, they screen it for the first time at the local bar. The brother of a girl whose scene ultimately was not used sees her featured briefly while looking through the bar window; he angrily barges in takes the reel off the projector, covers it in whiskey and sets it aflame. It is revealed that this was the only print they had, all their work was now destroyed. However, the cinematographer had been taping the entire production process on mini DV tapes. He then edits these down into a completely innocent documentary about the trials and tribulations of making  their porn film. The movie he cuts together from the DV tapes is the actual film "The Amateurs" itself. "The Amateurs" becomes a hit within the independent film community, which brings fame and fortune to the group.
