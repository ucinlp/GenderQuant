In Red River Valley, Banker Hartley Moore  schemes to sabotage the efforts of citizens to secure water rights in order to win water profits for himself. Following the murder of five men who were overseeing the completion of an irrigation system, Gene Autry  is hired for the dangerous job of "ditch rider", in charge of patrolling the ditches to prevent malfunction or sabotage. At the Red River Land and Irrigation Company, Steve Conway  works for Mary Baxter  and her father, George Baxter . Jealous of Mary's attention towards Gene, Conway joins Moore in his scheming actions and hires Bull Dural and his gang to dynamite the water gates and kill the ditch riders. On his first night on the job, Gene and his friend Frog Millhouse  are almost killed. They apprehend Bull's henchmen and turn them over to the sheriff. Conway and Bull then rob the payroll, accuse Gene of the crime, and encourage Baxter's workmen to revolt by destroying the dam. Gene and Frog go after Bull, while Baxter and the railroad conductor hold off the men at the dam until Gene arrives with Bull and the payroll. Conway and Moore steal the train in a desperate attempt to escape, but they are killed riding into dynamite. Baxter successfully finishes the irrigation, after which, Gene and Mary ride off on their honeymoon.
