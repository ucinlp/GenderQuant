In November 1973, Frank and his grandson go on a late afternoon hunt that forever changes their lives. Just before dusk, the hunters track down and find, to their horror, that they've not shot a deer but Marion Mitchell, a long-time neighbor and family enemy, trespassing on their land. Due to the sour history of land disputes between their family and the Mitchell family, Frank assures the boy that the only way to take care of the issue is to take Marion's corpse deep into the woods. After hours of trouble and difficulty, Frank and the boy find themselves only deeper in darkness. Though Frank tells the skeptical grandson everything will soon pass, the boy is questionable whether everything will truly be okay, come morning.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2016168/plotsummary According to an article in @Urban Magazine, the story of Come Morning is completely fictional but was partially inspired by Sims' boyhood hunting trips with his grandfather.http://www.aturbanmagazine.com/people/tabid/65/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/255/come-morning.aspx
