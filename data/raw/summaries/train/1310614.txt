The band is a three-piece vocal group dominated by their utterly untalented lead singer "M*Pete". When they are caught lip-synching before the release of their first album, scandal erupts  and they are dropped by their record company. They consider leaving the music industry, but their manager gets them a sponsorship deal with a Norwegian fish finger manufacturer. Ultimately they bounce back to fame after an appearance at the HitAwards Norwegian music awards show.
