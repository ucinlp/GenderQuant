Jerilee Randall is an innocent schoolgirl living in the San Fernando Valley area of California with dreams of becoming a famous screenwriter. Shortly after winning a trophy for her creative writing, she meets the son of a famous screenwriter, Walter Thornton, at a party. She goes home with him, along with some other friends, and during a late evening pool party, one of Jerilee's friends  beats her, slaps her and then sexually assaults her with a garden hose nozzle. Walter arrives after the assault has taken place and saves her from further attacks. A friendship, then a love affair, develops between them, and they soon marry, despite the disapproval of Jerilee's mother. The marriage begins to fall apart when she rewrites one of his scripts and is told she had improved it greatly.  Divorce is inevitable when Walter scorns Jerilee during an argument and accuses her of enjoying having been raped all those years ago. After the divorce, Jerilee has several love affairs while trying to get her own screenplay produced. She uses her sexual charms to pave the way to recognition, with revenge thrown in the end for good measure. Jerilee finally has a nervous breakdown in a sequence where she sees the callous people of her past appear as faces on the keys of her typewriter. The film ends with Jerilee finally successful and winning a prestigious award for her screenplay of a film titled The Hold-Outs. At the live awards telecast, she admits to her ex-husband Walter Thornton that she has never learned "the meaning of self-respect." Jerilee then refuses to accept the award, and walks out of the auditorium with her newfound dignity.
