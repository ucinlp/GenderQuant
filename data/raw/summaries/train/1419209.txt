 André Maciel, a young man who works in a photocopier shop, falls in love with his neighbour Sílvia, who works in a clothes shop. In order to get closer to her he decides to buy a dress he can't afford. To pay for it he begins photocopying money, which quickly gets out of control. Once he realizes that he can get away with photocopying money, he decides to try it on a slightly larger scale. Even so, he realizes that the amount he can make by photocopying is limited and so he looks for better ways to get money. Being a guy with little education and a job as a copy machine operator, he decides that the only way out he has is to rob a bank somehow, so that he can run away with his sweetheart Silvia. The plot also has characters such as Marinês, Cardoso, Feitosa , and his mother along with Silvia's guardian / father, Antunes. The movie takes an unexpected twist when André, who does not really look like the kind of guy who could pull off a robbery, actually pulls it off and the next day he also finds out that he has won the lottery with the numbers ' 1 2 3 4 5 6'. He does all the activities with the help of his friend Cardoso. Two people die in the movie and eventually, the movie goes on to tell us the truth behind all the incidents and how they were actually masterminded by Silvia. The movie ends with Silvia writing to the man she believes is her father and telling her about the journey she had undertaken to be in Rio, the place she meets Paulo, her father.
