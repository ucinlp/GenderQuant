Craig and Helen  are two teenagers who, along with their friends enjoy the latest trend of traditional jazz. However, the mayor as well as a group of adults dislike the trend and move to have the jukebox in the local coffee shop taken away. Craig and Helen, with the help of a character who also functions as an omniscient narrator, journey to a radio station's studios in hopes of finding a disc jockey and organizing a show to gain popularity for the music. They meet David Jacobs, who agrees to help, along with several artists who are willing to perform. But upon hearing the news of the upcoming performance, the mayor decides to stop the bands' van by any means necessary. When the show is scheduled to start, Craig and Helen find that their disc-jockey and musicians have not yet arrived, so they decide to find local talent within the crowd of guests. The interim acts manage to stall the crowd long enough for the true performers' bus to traverse a series of traps the city council had set up for them. Just in time, the performers reach their stage and put on their act for the citizens. The film ends with the town's kids and teens enjoying the music and the adults grudgingly accepting it.
