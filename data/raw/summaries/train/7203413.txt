Angst tells the story of a group of horror film devotees living in Sydney's King's Cross. There's Dean ([[Sam Lewis , a cynical, sexually frustrated video store employee with a bad case of unresolved love. Then there are his flatmates Ian ([[Justin Smith  and Jade  - Ian works in an adult bookstore, waiting for his break as a stand-up comedian, whereas Jade doesn't work at all, content to smoke pot and watch videos while she can still get away with it. Wandering into our characters' lives is street kid Mole , who challenges Jade's lifestyle by stealing the trio's trusty VCR, and the alluring May , a goth chick on whom Dean develops an over-the-counter crush. It has been described as an Australian version of Kevin Smith's Clerks and Mallrats with the same Dark humor as SubUrbia.
