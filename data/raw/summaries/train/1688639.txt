Nino Culotta is an Italian immigrant, newly arrived in Australia. He expected to work for his cousin as a sports writer for an Italian magazine. However on arrival in Sydney Nino discovers that the cousin has abandoned the magazine, leaving a substantial debt to Kay Kelly. Nino declares that he will get a job and pay back the debt. Working as a labourer Nino becomes mates with his co-workers, despite some difficulties with Australian slang and culture of the 1960s. Nino endeavours to understand the aspirational values and social rituals of everyday urban Australians, and assimilate. A romantic attraction builds between Nino and Kay despite her frosty exterior and her conservative Irish father's dislike of Italians.{{cite news}} A tone of racism exists in the film between Anglo-Saxon/Anglo-Irish characters such as Kay Kelly's dad Harry  and Nino. This is undermined when Nino, sitting in the Kelly house notices a picture of the pope on the wall. Nino says "If I'm a dago, then he's a dago". Realising the impossibility of referring to the pope by that derogatory term, Harry gives in.
