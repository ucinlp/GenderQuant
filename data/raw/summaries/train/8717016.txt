The southernmost tip of Patagonia, in Argentina near to the Straits of Magellan, is an interesting place, with some of the roughest seas in the world. It's a good location for a resort for travelers. As such, a British corporation has purchased property to build an airport. However, holding up plans is a stubborn Irish rancher who won't sell his land. In order to fight the proposed plans he fences in his land and at the same time fences in his two late-teenaged children. Eva Logan  is particularly frustrated at this event as it prevents any romantic options she has.
