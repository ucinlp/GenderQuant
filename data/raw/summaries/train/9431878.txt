The kids, preferring Jennifer  to Vivian, play matchmaker, and expose the plotting Vivian for who she really is. In the ending of this movie, when Oliver arrives at his splendidly beautiful castle, he discovers that his ruthless and corrupt fiancée, Vivian, has already made arrangements for their wedding and that they were going to get married that very evening. Later on, Jennifer, Alex, and Katie arrive, and Oliver demands to speak with Jennifer. To Alex and Katie's dismay, Jennifer is mercilessly fired by their father  just moments before the ceremony begins. Alex, then, comes up with an idea to spy on Vivian and her clumsy, odd sisters. As the children, Nigel  , and Oliver spy on Vivian in her boudoir, Vivian reveals her evil plots and schemes. Infuriated, Oliver bursts into the boudoir and breaks up with Vivian. Oliver storms out of the castle with Vivian and her wacky sisters chasing after him. Once they descend upon the bridge, Vivian demands that Oliver hand over her ring. Oliver takes the ring out of his coat pocket, throws it over the bridge, and into the water. Vivian, then, blindly launches herself off the bridge in her silk bridal gown and plummets into the water. Vivian's sisters try to catch their sister as she falls, but they end up falling into the water as well. Vivian emerges from the depths of water and angrily pounds the water's surface with her clenched fists. Later, Jenny and Oliver share a kiss.
