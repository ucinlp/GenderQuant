Two affairs, a generation apart. Nick ([[Kevin Anderson , a professor of architecture in upstate New York, comes to an Illinois town to be with his birth mother  in the final days of her illness; he was adopted and has never known her. On the first day, he runs into Paul , a college friend, whose construction company is demolishing an old, downtown department store where a murder-suicide happened 30 years before. The building is of beautiful cast-iron construction, so Nick wants to study it before the demolition. Paul introduces Nick to his wife, Jane , and over the next four days, their attraction grows as Nick explores the old building, attends his mother's bedside, and unravels the past.
