The plot of the movie is convoluted and rather loose. It concerns a man dressed as priest who gathers together a group of teen boys, both American and European, and takes them to a beach on the Mediterranean Sea. There he has plans to stage a play based on the biblical Book of Genesis. Throughout the movie, the boys in question are frequently entirely nude and are shown frolicking in the surf, building shelters, driving a van and climbing up cliffs. The storyline is largely stream-of-consciousness and starts many threads it then leaves unfinished.
