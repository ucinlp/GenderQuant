 Slim , Frank , Otis  and Alex  are a group of youthful bank robbers who commit their crimes anonymously and in innovative ways involving extreme sports such as skating and snowboarding. The group evade capture from the police, led by Lieutenant Macgruder , and plan even more daring robberies. But an anonymous individual seems to know who they all are and threatens to inform the police unless they undertake a robbery for him. Subsequently, the Mafia, represented by underworld enforcer Surtayne , instruct the group to work for them, otherwise they will be killed. At the same time, Slim becomes romantically involved with Karen , a detective who distrusts Lieutenant Macgruder and believes that he is not doing all he can to find the bank robbers and bring them to justice. Ultimately Slim, the leader and brains of the group, hatches a plan for their final retirement: five consecutive burglaries, in five days, involving 20 million dollars. In the process of executing the robberies, the group turn the tables on the anonymous individual  and the Mafia and escape with all of the money that they have stolen, to a foreign country. Karen comes to realise that Slim is one of the bank robbers but consoles herself with the arrest of Lieutenant Macgruder, as Otis had managed to plant some of the stolen money in his office while posing as a cleaner.
