In Brittany, a middle-aged woman, Anna lives in a rambling home with her sometime dead father , her opinionated mother  and the memories of her three grown-up daughters. As Anna struggles with her mid-life crisis, the possessions and photographs in the home begin to spark her memories of childhood and earlier adulthood. In particular the memories evoked are of her three husbands and the children she bore with them. Her first marriage to Fanny's English father  failed and as a consequence, Fanny  barely knows him. Fanny's half-sister is Camille , who Anna had with Camille's now dead father, Max . There is also her third husband, Jean , with whom she had Lilly , but he left to pursue affairs.Boxes Variety.
