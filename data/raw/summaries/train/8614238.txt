Jibananda is a drunkard zamindar. Ekkari is his companion in all sinful deeds and greed for money. Sorashi is the priestess in the local Chandi temple and the ex-wife of Jibananda . She is adamant and responsible, but stubborn and honest. She has immense influence in certain sections of the society. Jibananda knew Sorashi. When he was young, he married her. Then she was known as Alaka. Circumstances force Sorash to stay whole night in the drunk Jibananda's house. This created a ripple amongst the local villagers when they come to know about this incidence. But Sorashi gave a legal statement to the police and magistrate that she went to the zamindar's house villingly. Jibananda was freed from all offences due to this statement. But the village leaders were very strict to their decision. Sanbeswar Shiromani Mr Chowdhury, Janardan Bapu decided not to asssign the responsibility of a priestess of the temple to Sorashi any more. Nirmal, son-in-law of Sabeswar Shiromani, is very impressed by the attitude and intelligence of Sorashi. Jibananda later tried to make advances on Sorashi but was refused by her, making him angry and he attempts to evict her from her shelter. Sagan and his team wait for Sorashi's order to fight against jibananda. But Sorashi is totally dispassionate. She leaves the temple. In the end Jibananda realises his mistakes and surrenders to Sorashi.
