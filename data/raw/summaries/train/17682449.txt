Nick Donovan  and Ocee James  were two former race car drivers who joined the LAPD as part of the B.A.D. C.A.T. squad . Using their superior driving skills, the two mainly saw fit to run the bad guys off the road rather than question them. Their superior, Captain Nathan  publicly chastised the two, but privately encouraged their "loose cannon" style. Officer Samantha Jensen  would occasionally lend a hand when a more feminine approach was called for. Also seen were Ma , who owned a bar which the boys frequented, and Rodney , a former car thief trying to get on the straight and narrow.
