Unni  is a share broker in Coimbatore and leads a comfortable life with his wife Latha  and daughter Lakshmi/Lechu . Into the cosiness of such a living intrudes a stranger  who introduces himself as Jose. Cashing in on Unni's forgetfulness, Jose goads him into believing that he is Unni's 7th grade classmate. However, a sense of insecurity pervades, with the unwelcome guest – alcoholic and somewhat eccentric – pitching for an extended stay. Unni's misgivings about the 'mystery man' and his ulterior motives proves true, when his confidant and classmate, Dr Alex Varghese , on consultation, reaffirms his doubts that they had no schoolmate in the name of Jose. Soon, they discover to their horror that the stranger is that man whose arrival they have been dreading for a long time now, Sivankutty. It is eventually revealed that Unni and Alex ruined Sivankutty's life by framing the latter for a murder which they had committed. The duo realises that it is payback time and that they're at the receiving end. Death is looming over their head.
