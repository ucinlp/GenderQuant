Shot between 1986 and 1988, Kafi's Story captures Nuba peoples life just before they got involved in the Second Sudanese Civil War. Kafi, a young man from the Torogi village in the Nuba Mountains in Sudan is one of the first men to travel north to the capital Khartoum in search of money. Having money is the only way through to get a dress and to get married to a second wife, Tete. Arthur Howes went back to Sudan ten years later. He has then shot Nuba Conversations where he tries to recapture Nuba peoples life conditions during the war.
