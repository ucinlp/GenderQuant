The film, a dark psychological drama, stars Tom McCamus as Henry Adler, a bank employee and struggling actor who finally gets his big break, being cast as a police officer in a television series. However, Adler begins to identify too closely with the sense of power and authority that comes with wearing the police uniform, takes to wearing it in public as if he were a real police officer, and gradually loses his grip on reality.
