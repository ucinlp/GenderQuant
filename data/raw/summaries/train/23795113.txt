A hapless delivery man learns why sometimes too much of a bad thing can be detrimental to your personal well being after getting caught up with an older woman who sends his life spinning out of control. Trey  may be working hard, though he just can't seem to catch a break. He's got no money for school, and his recent attempt to win over the girl of his dreams  resulted in nothing less than complete and total embarrassment. But while a seductive cougar  may be more than happy to pay for Trey's "personal delivery services," his ideal situation is about to backfire in a way that the roving Romeo could have never seen coming.
