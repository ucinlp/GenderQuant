Texas Ranger Gene Autry  and cavalry Lieutenant Bob Cameron  are competing for the attentions of Dixie Summerall , the beautiful daughter of Colonel Summerall  at Fort Adobe, Texas. Their romantic aspirations are cut short when an Indian war party threatens to cause trouble. A peace treaty is signed with the help of Duval , the fort's interpreter. Gene and his buddies, Frog Millhouse  and Rufe Jones , suspect that Duval is working with the Indians, and they go to his canteen to investigate. Confronted by the Texas Ranger, Duval tries to kill Gene and a barroom brawl ensues. Afterwards, Gene and his friends are court-martialed for their involvement in the fight. When Gene tries to warn Colonel Summerall and Major Crosby about the interpreter's involvement with the Indians, he is arrested for the murder of a Comanche brave. Known to the Indians as Chief Tavibo, Duval is now free to continue his plot to re-route a supply train so that the Comanches can attack and capture the cavalry's ammunition. After Gene escapes jail, he joins the bloody battle between the cavalry and the Comanches. Soon Frog arrives with the Texas Rangers to win the battle, during which Duval is killed and his true identity is revealed. After peace is restored, Colonel Summerall apologizes to Gene, and Gene wins Dixie as his bride.
