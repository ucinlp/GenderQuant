During the last days of the Civil War, President Lincoln  selects Indian scout James Kingston  to facilitate a cattle shipment from Texas to the north. He is helped by cattle driver Oâ€™Roarke  and Maj. McGuire . Mexican fanatic Joaquin Jironza  wants the Henry Repeating Rifles that Kingston has. Embittered ex-rebel leader Lee Parker  is also an obstacle to Kingston's mission, as he tries to get the cattle through Apache territory.
