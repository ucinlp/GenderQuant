Peter Nelson and Jerry Hotchkiss have just gotten out of the army. Hotchkiss decides to use the G.I. Bill to become a lion tamer. He gets a job with the Clyde Brent Circus , whose owner, Jill Brent, is in financial difficulties. Nelson tags along. Hotchkiss, while learning the lion trade, also does odd jobs at the circus, including filling in for the Human Cannonball. His real dream is to become a circus clown. Nelson, meanwhile, is shown a romantic interest by Saadia, Queen of the Trapeze, and quickly gets a job as her assistant. Brent has also shown interest in Nelson and becomes jealous. Hotchkiss finds Puffo the Clown in a drunken state, so he seizes the opportunity and fills in for Puffo. He takes the name "Jerrico the Wonder Clown" and becomes the new star of the circus. In the end, Nelson and Brent get together, and the circus is in better shape than ever thanks to its new clown.
