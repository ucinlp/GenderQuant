14 Hours is based on the harrowing events of June 2001, when Tropical Storm Allison stalled over the Houston metropolitan area, pouring nearly 30 inches of rain on the city within a 14-hour period. The story begins as the storm seems to be moving away from Houston. Jeanette Makins , a nurse at Memorial Hermann Hospital, arrives ready for what she expects to be a normal day. But Tropical Storm Allison's rains return, quickly turning a normal day into a nightmare. As floodwaters inundate the lower levels of the hospital, a brilliant young surgeon, Dr. Foster , makes the decision to move the patients to safer ground, including a young couple whose premature baby is struggling for life, as well as, a girl and her mother, severely hurt in a car accident. With the resourceful thinking of Chuck Whortle , chief of Harris County Emergency Management, the hospital staff and volunteers race against the clock to get all patients to safety.
