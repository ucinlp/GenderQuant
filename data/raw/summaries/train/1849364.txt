This feminist Hong Kong film comprises three separate stories telling of the predicament of modern women when they have more than one choice of a partner. In Singapore, Fann Wong is a reporter who falls for a shy baker  while she’s seeing her suave co-worker . Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, Theresa Lee is about to marry, but falls for her fiancé's twin brother . And finally, in Macau, Michelle Reis is stuck between Alex Fong and David Wu, though not in the same way the other two women are.
