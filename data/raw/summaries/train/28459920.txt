In New York City, avant garde sculptor Lily McGuire  lives a complicated and frustrating life as she tries to not only provide for herself and her daughter, but debut her latest artwork known as Apology. The design is a two part project consisting of a walkthrough sculpture of advanced mechanical design and a phone service that allows callers to anonymously leave confessions of whatever they desire on the answering machine. There is just one problem: someone has been calling the line and using it to announce a string of recent high-profile killings. After contacting the police, Detective Hungate  advises Lily to take the threats seriously. Eventually, the serial killer stops his phone calls and intends to murder Lily to the sounds of the exhibits programmed confessions.http://www.moviefone.com/movie/apology/1001577/main] Charles S.
