The film begins by revealing that an epidemic disease has overwhelmed humanity, turning nearly everyone into blood-thirsty vampire like humans. According to the narrator, there is no known cure and very few survivors left fighting "Against the Dark". The first few scenes are used to establish the main characters, with Seagal playing a tough guy in charge of a group of vampire hunters. The survivors in the hospital are shown to be scared, isolated and untrusting. As the characters work their way through the hospital, they drift apart numerous times, often getting lost and attacked. . To make matters worse for the survivors, a massive army base is planning to sterilize the area at dawn. The survivors explain that there is only one functioning exit from the hospital  and they have to get to this exit before the emergency power runs out and they are shut inside. To make matters worse many of the stairways and elevators are blocked off, forcing them to make their way level by level, finding a way to the next one down to gain the exit. Meanwhile, Cross  tries to prevent Lt. Waters  from unleashing a bombing raid on the hospital. Some survivors and a hunter are killed and one is infected as they make their way out of the hospital. A survivor is captured by a human to be fed on by his infected daughter, but is rescued by Tao . As the humans make their way out a horde of infected chase them. As they exit the hospital just in time before the power fails the vampires become trapped inside. The surviving humans then run as jet planes bomb the forsaken hospital.
