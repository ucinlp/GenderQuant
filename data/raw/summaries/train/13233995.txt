A homeless Pink Panther is roaming the streets late at night, barely able to keep himself awake. He manages to find a flop house, but gets tossed out as quickly as he enters. Eventually, he finds his way into a cozy, nearby home, and washes up for bed. Soon afterward, the sauced homeowner stumbles in and crashes to bed, completely unaware that the Pink Panther is occupying his bed. Only after the homeowner gets himself a hotwater bottle and places it in his bed does the boiling feline, make himself known. Having never seen the Pink Panther before, the homeowner is convinced that he is hallucinating, and phones Alcoholics Anonymous . The AA rep comes over , smells the alcohol on the homeowner's breath, and sternly proceeds to remove every bottle of booze in the house, tossing them out into the trash can at the curbside. The two guys are then about to drink a toast to sobriety  when the Pink Panther strolls through the house, looking for the bed. Realizing that the hallucination was real after all, both men run out of the house and chase after the garbage truck in an attempt to retrieve the liquor.Beck, Jerry.
