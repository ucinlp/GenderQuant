Shifting periodically between two parallel stories, Dust opens in present-day New York City with a young criminal, Edge , being confronted at gunpoint by an ailing old woman, Angela , whose apartment he is attempting to burglarize. While he awaits an opportunity to escape, she launches into a tale about two outlaw brothers, at the turn of the 20th century, who travel to Ottoman-controlled Macedonia. The two brothers have transient ill will between them, and they become estranged when confronted with a beautiful woman, Lilith . In the New York storyline, Edge hunts for Angela's gold to pay back a debt, and gradually grows closer to her. In the Macedonian story, the brothers end up fighting for opposite sides of a revolution, with the religious Elijah  taking up sides with the Ottoman sultan and gunslinger Luke  joining "the Teacher" , a Macedonian rebel.
