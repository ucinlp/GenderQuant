Among the warriors stands the champion, Deathstalker, who handily defeats all opponents. Mysteriously, combatants disappear from the castle one by one. Now, in a blood chilling Match of Titans, Deathstalker must defend his fellow warriors, his life and his newfound love against an invincible army of Stone Warriors and the wicked Queen who rules them as master.
