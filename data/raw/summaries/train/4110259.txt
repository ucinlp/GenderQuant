Rachel Schpitendavel , an innocent Amish girl from rural Pennsylvania, arrives in New York's Lower East Side, hoping to make it as a dancer. Rachel's dances are based on Bible stories. She auditions at Minsky's Burlesque, but her dances are much too dull  for the bawdy show. But then Billy Minsky  and the show's jaded straight man, Raymond Paine , concoct a plan to foil moral crusader Vance Fowler , who is intent on shutting down the theater. Minsky publicizes Rachel as the notorious Madamoiselle Fifi, performing the "dance that drove a million Frenchmen wild." This will invite a raid by Fowler and the police. But they will let Rachel perform her innocuous Bible dances, thus humiliating Fowler. During the run-up to her midnight performance, Raymond and his partner, Chick , show Rachel the ropes of burlesque, and they both fall for her in the process. Meanwhile, Rachel's stern father , who even objects to her Bible dances, arrives in search of his daughter. The film climaxes when Rachel takes the stage after her father has called her a whore and she realizes that the Minskys are just using her. Her father tries to drag her off-stage, but she pulls away and accidentally tears a slit in her dress. The sold-out crowd spurs her on and Rachel begins to enjoy her power over the audience and starts to strip. But when she looks into the wings and sees Raymond leaving the theater for good, she calls and throws out her arms to him, inadvertently dropping the front of her dress and baring her breasts. Fowler blows his whistle and the police rush the stage and close down the show. A madcap fight sequence follows. In the end, most of the cast members are carted off to the paddy wagon, including Rachel's mystified father.
