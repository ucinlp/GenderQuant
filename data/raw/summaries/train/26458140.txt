Much of the plot depicts the testing of downward firing ejection seats from B-47 Stratojet bombers that were conducted at Eglin AFB, Florida, initially between 7 October and 21 October 1953, when nine tests were conducted of the seat from a B-47 over Eglin's water ranges over the Gulf of Mexico, by the Air Proving Ground, at an altitude of 10,000 feet and various speeds. A second series of tests was also conducted beginning 8 July 1954 after refinements to the system.Henderson, Col.

"'Actually, we feel that the star of the movie will be the Air Force and the progress it is making in the Aero Medical field,' said Robert Webb, director, in commenting on the movie. "It will deal with [the] Air Force's work in the aero medical field and will include actual shots of experimentations with the Air Force sled being made under direction of Lt. Col. John Paul Stapp, Air Force surgeon, who appeared on the cover of the Sept. 12 [1955] issue of Time magazine."Fort Walton Beach, Florida, "Movie Crew Shoots Scenes in the Area", Playground News, Thursday 22 September 1955, Volume 9, Number 86, page 1.
