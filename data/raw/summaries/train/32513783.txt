Chip 'n' Dale's curiosity leads them into Donald's home after they see him chop down a Christmas tree in the forest and take it inside. They see nuts and candy through a window and decide to try to take them. They slip in through the mail slot and load the nuts into a toy truck. But Donald sees them stealing the nuts and uses the toys to foil them. When Chip 'n' Dale catch on, Donald next dresses as Father Christmas and gives Chip a much larger present than Dale making him jealous and start fighting with Chip. The plan initially works and Donald traps and crashes the chipmunks in a toy paddy wagon. Donald then loads a pop gun with nuts and the chipmunks retaliate. At last the confrontation escalates into full out combat. Donald sets up a fort of presents on one side of the living room while Chip 'n' Dale bombard him from across the room with the toy cannon. Dale covertly sneaks a Candlestick telephone into Donald's fort which Chip uses to transmit direct cannon fire. After the chipmunks have neutralized Donald's means to resist, they march back to their tree, and in a scene reminiscent of The Spirit of '76, employ the help up the mechanical toys to transport the hoard of nuts.
