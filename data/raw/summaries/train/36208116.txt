Ken Marks is the new student at his new school in Phoenix, AZ. There he meets the girl of his dreams named Julie. Unfortunately, she has a boyfriend, Tom, who is not only possessive of her but is also a brutal karate expert and considers himself "King of the Campus". Ken also meets Billy Grant, the school janitor. When Tom's bulling becomes too much for Ken to handle, Billy, who is not only a martial arts expert himself but also an ex-cop, decides to train Ken to defend himself. But when Billy learns that Tom's sensei is none other than Lee, an old enemy who wants nothing more than to see Billy dead, both Ken and Billy are pitted against their adversaries in two separate fighting matches at Lee's dojo where only one side can win, student vs. student, sensei vs. sensei.
