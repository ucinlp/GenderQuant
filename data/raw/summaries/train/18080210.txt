Manbei Kohayagawa  is the head of a small sake brewery company at Kyoto with three daughters. His eldest and youngest daughters, Akiko  and Noriko , stay together in Osaka. Akiko is a widow who helps out at an art gallery and who has a son. Noriko, unmarried, works as a salaried office worker. Manbei's second daughter, Fumiko , lives with him. Her husband helps at the brewery and they have a young son. Manbei asks his brother-in-law Kitagawa  to find Akiko a husband, and Kitagawa lets Akiko meet a friend Isomura Eiichirou , a widower, at a pub. Isomura is enthusiastic about the match but Akiko is hesitant. Manbei also asks Kitagawa to arrange a matchmaking session for his youngest daughter, Noriko. During summer Manbei sneaks out constantly to meet his old flame, a former mistress by the name of Sasaki Tsune . Sasaki has a grown-up, rather Westernized daughter Yuriko who may or may not be Manbei's own daughter. When Fumiko finds out Manbei has been seeing Sasaki again, she is angered and confronts her father, but Manbei denies the whole affair. The Kohayagawa family meets for a memorial service for their late mother at Arashiyama. After returning, Manbei has a heart attack but survives. Akiko asks Noriko about her matchmaking session with a man with a voracious appetite, but it appears Noriko is more inclined towards a friend Teramoto , a lecturer who has just moved to Sapporo as an assistant professor. In a secret trip out with Sasaki to and back from Osaka, Manbei has another heart attack, and dies shortly after. Sasaki informs the daughters of what happened. The ailing Kohayagawa brewery is to be merged with a business rival's, while Noriko decides to go to Sapporo to search out Teramoto. At the film's end, the Kohayagawa family gathers and reminisces about Manbei's life as his body is cremated.
