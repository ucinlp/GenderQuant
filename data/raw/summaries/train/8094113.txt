The onset of the Great Depression has forced the Stooges to look for jobs. However, they are mistaken as thieves and soon find themselves on the run from the police. With a cop chasing them, they flee into an art school where they are mistaken for students. They take their first art lessons while hiding from the police, resulting in a climactic clay fight that takes no prisoners. The film ends when three art students break sculptures over the boys' heads, resulting in them being soundly beaten up.
