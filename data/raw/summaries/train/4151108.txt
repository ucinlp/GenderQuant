Peter O'Toole is Peter Plunkett, the owner of a dilapidated Irish castle which has been converted to a bed and breakfast supplying the only employment for the local villagers. Owing money to an American businessman, Plunkett has the idea to turn the castle into "The most haunted castle in Europe" for the tourist trade. He and his wacky staff of Irish characters set about creating ghost costumes and effects for their first group of American lodgers. At first annoyed by the inept hauntings, the American guests  soon get what they paid for as the genuine ghosts of Castle Plunkett take umbrage with being cheaply exploited and stage a full scale paranormal event. Two of the castle's ghosts, Mary Plunkett and Martin Brogan  become romantically entangled with Guttenberg and D'Angelo's characters. This romantic twist is the focus of most of the plot.
