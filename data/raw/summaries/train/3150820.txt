Porky Pig is on a radio quiz show called "Truth or AAAAHHH!!", a parody of the popular quiz show Truth or Consequences hosted by Daffy Duck, sponsored by "Eagle Hand Laundry" , and broadcasted by the Ajax Broadcasting Company, in which the object is to answer near-impossible questions, such as "Who, mind you WHO, was the referee for the New Zealand heavyweight championship fight in 1726?"  Failing to answer the other questions required him to "pay the penalty"  These penalties include Porky being crushed by the Rock of Gibraltar, rained upon by Niagara Falls, tied up and blown up with dynamite, pounded with a mallet, threatened by a buzz saw, crushed by a safe, and other forms of abuse, to Daffy's amusement. Eventually, after a particularly snide line from Daffy , Porky threatens to retaliate, forcing Daffy to offer his final challenge for a huge jackpot. Porky is invited to meet a celebrity "Miss Shush", but it's revealed by Daffy to be his final torture; Miss Shush is really a gorilla who proceeds to maul Porky. Porky eventually emerges and advances on Daffy menacingly, and Daffy finally gives in: awarding Porky the jackpot of 26 million dollars and three cents. Porky immediately contacts the Ajax Broadcasting Company and, upon learning that they will sell for the exact amount of the jackpot, buys it out. Now Daffy's boss, Porky takes over the quiz show and then asks Daffy: "At what latitude and longitude did the Wreck of the Hesperus occur?". Daffy fails to answer, and as a result, Porky gets his revenge by submiting Daffy to the same "penalties" that he had received earlier. Daffy is then tied to a long plank being cut by the same buzz saw Porky was on to begin the cartoon, quickly irising out after Daffy screams at his studio audience: "Have you got a doctor in the balcony, lady?!"
