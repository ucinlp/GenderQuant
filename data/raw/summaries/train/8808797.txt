Just weeks before their wedding, newly crowned King Edvard  and his American fiancée Paige  find their relationship — and the Danish monarchy — in jeopardy. Edvard's childhood friend, Princess Kirsten , comes for a visit and plots to try to steal Edvard from Paige, both for her personal reasons  and that her father, a Norwegian royal, is heavily in debt and seeks to marry Kirsten into the royal family's money. At one point Princess Kirsten teaches Paige how to say something in Danish. When Paige is asked to say something in Danish she says what Kirsten taught her and we come to find out the Paige has just called the Queen Mother a green donkey, which both offends and puzzles the royal family. An old law is also brought to light, one that requires a Danish king to be married to a Scandinavian princess before his 23rd birthday, or be forced to abdicate and relinquish the crown. The stress caused by the law causes Paige and Edvard to break up as Edvard plans to marry Princess Kirsten. Paige decides to stay in Denmark to finish her semester. During the "wedding" planning of princess Kristen and Edvard, Paige sees that through Edvard's body language that he does not love Kirsten and is only going through the motions. Paige is able to find a loophole in the succession law with the help of her friends, who are law students. The newer law states that any woman can be a crowned a princess if she can demonstrate knowledge of the Danish Constitution by reading it in Danish before the Parliament. Luckily the Danish Parliament is present at the wedding, the Constitution is read, and the happy couple marries.
