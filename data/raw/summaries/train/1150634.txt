Set in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1959, Diner tells the story of a group of male high school friends, now in their twenties, who reunite for the wedding of one of their group. The title refers to the diner that was located at Reisterstown Road and Rogers Avenue, Baltimore, the group's late-night hangout . The semi-autobiographical film explores the changing relationships among these friends as they become adults through what is mostly a series of vignettes rather than a traditional narrative. Levinson encouraged improvisation among his cast to capture naturalistic camaraderie.
