Michigan Governor James Reynolds Pryce  is a popular liberal politician who, while running for the office of the President of the United States, finds out to what a great degree his life and career are influenced by the women in his life. As a front-runner for the Democratic Party presidential candidate, Pryce owes the success of his campaign to his manager Lauren Hartman  and his wife Jennifer . Pryce has not yet chosen a vice-presidential running mate and has a hard time making the decision. Senator Parker Gable  was something of a mentor to Pryce in his early political career but Gable is a womanizer which makes Pryce uncomfortable with making him the vice-presidential candidate. Nevertheless, Gable's Washington socialite wife Meg  considers Gable to be the best choice and tries to exert pressure over Pryce to make this happen. Pryce's other choices are Senator Mitchell Morris , a lobbyist whom Pryce dislikes due to his close ties to Big Business, and Senator Terrence Randall  who is disliked by Pryce's shallow Hollywood campaign fundraising manager Shawna Morgan . Being previously sexually involved with Lauren, Meg and Shawna before marrying Jennifer is a fact that makes listening to their advice all that much harder for Pryce. All four women are seemingly more intent on exerting control over Pryce and winning their own personal battles against each other rather than honestly trying to help him make the correct political decision.
