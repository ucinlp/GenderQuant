The short-story adaptations are set as flashbacks to 1893 within a frame story set in 1946, near the end of Wells' life, when he is interviewed by members of a military research institute interested in his past exploits. In 1893, Jane is shown to be a student, with Wells initially one of her two potential suitors, the other being a member of the college staff. Wells is portrayed as a single man, a journalist and aspiring fiction writer, who is not scientifically trained. Eventually their friendship becomes more intimate, and they move in together, despite the social conventions of the day.
