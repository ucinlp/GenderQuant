 Private Snafu has learned a secret, but the enemy is listening and he'd better zipper his lip. However, Snafu - little by little - lets his secret slip : His ship is about to set sail for Africa at 4:30. The information is picked up by spies and quickly relayed to Adolf Hitler, who orders the Nazis to attack the American fleet - which they do. A scene in which Private Snafu becomes drunk is musically accompanied by an excerpt from Raymond Scott's composition, Powerhouse.
