Bill is a Woolloomooloo larrikin, who vows to abandon his life of gambling  and drinking after a spell in gaol following a raid on a two up game. He falls in love with Doreen , who works in a pickle factory, but faces competition from a more sophisticated rival, Stor' at Coot. Bill and Doreen argue, but are eventually reunited and get married. Bill gives up drinking and hanging out with his mate, Ginger Mick, and becomes a family man. He gets an offer from his uncle to manage an orchard in the country, and he and Doreen settle down there with their baby.
