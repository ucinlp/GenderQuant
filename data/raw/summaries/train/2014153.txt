Ka Fu  and Natalie  , are from two different family backgrounds. Ka Fu's father  is a mini-bus driver and his mother  is a restaurant hostess. Natalie is from a very affluent family and her parents  are lawyers. Another contrast is that Ka Fu has a loving relationship with his parents, but Natalie's relationship with her parents is distant as they are often away on business trips. After Ka Fu and Natalie meet and fall in love, it is exactly this window of opportunity of Natalie's parents' absence that causes the two to have a weak moment in their budding love for each other, which results in Natalie getting pregnant. Despite her anxiety of this issue, she decides to go through with the pregnancy in complete support of her boyfriend, Ka Fu. However, Natalie, being underage and about two years younger than Ka Fu, causes her parents, especially her father, to fly into a rage and a law suit gets under way for Ka Fu and his parents. Ka Fu's parents also scold him and express that they do not want him to make the same mistakes they did. Learning of the impending legal action, Ka Fu and Natalie, with the help of their friends, run away and eke out a living for themselves in the countryside. The young lovers are eventually discovered by Ka Fu's parents. When Natalie goes into early labor, they are forced to return to the city, where she gives birth to a baby boy  and Ka Fu is arrested. During the court scene, the relationships of the parents and their son and daughter are resolved. Ka Fu was also sentenced to 3 months in a rehabilitation center for his actions. Upon his release, he is greeted by Natalie and their child.
