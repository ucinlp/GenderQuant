Brenda  and Yvonne , two girls from the North of England, arrive in London to seek fame and fortune. However, their image of the city is quickly tarnished when they are robbed of their savings. Determined not to let her chance slip, Yvonne visits Carnaby Street in the hope of catching the eye of a trendy photographer, whilst Brenda gets a job in a 'greasy spoon' cafe. Yvonne does get spotted by a trendy photographer, Tom Wabe , but for all the wrong reasons; she is singled out for being poorly dressed. After several unsuccessful job attempts, Yvonne accidentally wins the star prize in a television game show and decides to invest the prize money on being a pop star. Her single, I'm So Young, though patently awful, becomes a big hit and she and Brenda drift apart. However, at a glamorous party  the girls realise the shallowness of the media business and decide to return home.
