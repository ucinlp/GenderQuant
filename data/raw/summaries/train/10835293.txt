On the distant planet Pangea, a transmission of the show is seen by the child genius brother of native forces leader Tyra, who has been captured by the tyrannical Lord Vox of Vestron whose people, subsequent to some global catastrophe, migrated to the stars from Pangea thousands of years ago and now seek to recover the lost ancient knowledge of their people. Lord Vox intends to do this by conquering Pangea, their old home-world, and with the knowledge rebuild it as the seat of his empire. In his desperation Tyra's brother brings Captain Zoom to Pangea with hopes that he can save his sister and defeat the Vestrons. Though Captain Zoom is reluctant to lead the natives, his attempts to explain that he is only an actor leads the natives to believe he is a spy because he "is paid to pretend to be other people". He quickly backtracks, pretending that he was testing them, and through various adventures and using his old TV stories as inspiration he leads the natives to a victory by default as Lord Vox is turned into a statue by an ancient guardian.
