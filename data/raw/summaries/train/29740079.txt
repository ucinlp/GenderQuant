http://www.yehfaasleythemovie.com/ Arunima the daughter of one of the biggest builders in town has returned home after completing her studies. She is happy that she will now be living with her father Devinder Devilal Dua for good. Arunima lost her mother to a car accident when she was barely two. Devinder Devilal Dua is a gregarious man who loves his daughter a lot and wants his daughter Arunima to live as freely as possible. Arunima further chances upon a few things from the past and it is a revelation for her that her mothers personality was very different to what her father narrates. She further meets an old friend of her mother, Diggy and a few people from the past who tell stories that point in the direction that her mother was not a happy as long as she lasted. With the image of the past being different to what her father has been telling her, Arunima is left in doubt about what really is the past and especially when the father is not giving a conclusive answer. To top it, Arunima starts to learn about too many shades of her father that she has never seen. Arunima is at a loss, as everything that she is learning about the past is in complete contradiction to what she knew and the man she loves the most, her father, has so many shades that she is not even aware of. Arunima is torn between love for her father and the truth. But she is even more guilty as the needle of suspicion keeps pointing towards her own father. The man she loves the most is that man Arunima suspects. The shadow of doubt becomes a very difficult place to live under. So Arunima sets out on a journey to find the truth about her mothers and fathers past and more so how her mother died.
