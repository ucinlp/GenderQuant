Following a car accident, in which he believes he killed a boy, Arthur Seligman  falls for several hours into a coma. While in the coma, he pronounces incoherent sentences. At his awakening, he does not remember what happened before the crash, and he does not know the meaning of the words he pronounced while unconscious. The nurse who assisted him, Isabelle Kruger , recorded those to a tape, which she gives him. Arthur then tries to understand what happened, what those sentences mean, and begins to lose his grasp of reality.
