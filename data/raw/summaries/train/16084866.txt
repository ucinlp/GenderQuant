Ayat Ayat Cinta is the tale of a virtuous Muslim protagonist who overcomes all obstacles in life maintaining pure ideals. Fedi Nuril as Fahri bin Abdillah is a poor, intelligent student who wins a scholarship to complete his graduate degree at Egypt's esteemed Al Azhar University. Very disciplined and dedicated by nature, Fahri embraces his life in Cairo, completing his studies and translation of religious books with full enthusiasm, exactly according to pre-determined targets. Only one goal is left unattempted: the pursuit of marriage. For Fahri is innocent and pure, and does not believe in the concept of relationships prior to marriage. He is inarticulate and shy around women. All his life, only two women have been close to him â€“ his mother and grandmother. Life changes drastically in Egypt for he suddenly finds himself surrounded by four beautiful, distinctly different women. Carissa Putri as Maria Girgis, a shy, open-minded Coptic neighbor who is attracted to the teachings of the Quran, finds herself falling in love with Fahri . Melanie Putria as Nurul, a student at Al Azhar like Fahri, is the Muslim daughter of a renowned Indonesian cleric. Fahri feels unworthy of her and thus ignores his feelings for her, leaving her confused and guessing. Zaskia Adya Mecca as Noura, an abused Egyptian neighbor, develops strong romantic feelings for Fahri, who in turn simply sympathizes with her situation. His romantic rejection destroys her and eventually leads to a false accusation of rape. Rianti Cartwright as Aisha, a German-Turkish student in Cairo haunts Fahri with her beautiful eyes. Following an incident on the metro where Fahri defends her against narrow minded bigoted Muslims, both immediately develop feelings for each other.
