 The daily routine in the village of Yugla is shaken by the statistician clerk Asenov  who come with a mission to take the census of the hares in the locality. He make the village mayor Bay Georgi  mobilize the local men in realization of the absurd task. On the very day all the village men are in the field. The mayor, the teacher, the veterinarian... even an old man joins the group. Naturally all the efforts failed in fulfilling the mission since not a single hare came into sight. The undertaking ends with an open area banquet, with a grape brandy, and wine under a tree. The last episode presents Asenov leaving the village with his small noisy Russian car loaded to the top with fresh cabbage.
