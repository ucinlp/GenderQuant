Shammi Kapoor plays Pritam, a young man who desperately needs a job to pay for his mother's tuberculosis treatment. He finds out about a job tutoring two young women and two schoolgoing children - the catch is that their guardian, Sita Devi Verma  will only hire an old man for the job. Pritam disguises himself as an old man and takes the job. The situation is very tense between the young women and their aunt as the girls' parents have recently died and Sita Devi have been given the responsibility of the caretaker who is very strict. While Pritam's young avatar is romancing one of his two young tutoring charges , his old avatar is romancing their guardian. Producer F. C. Mehra, director Lekh Tandon, actor Shammi Kapoor and music director duo Shankar Jaikishan later worked together again on the 1969 film Prince.
