During the Irish War of Independence, Irish rebel leader Dennis Reardon  and English aristocrat Helen Drummond  meet and fall in love. Reardon is pursued, however, by British army officer Captain Preston . The original movie ended with Reardon getting shot and killed, but did not do well at the box office. A happier ending was also filmed which all subsequent versions have. The original cut has since been lost. The movie has several comic relief scenes: after a raid on an IRA "safe house", British officers grumble about being not being able to find Reardon, who is in fact standing just behind them; when the Irish Delegation goes to a formal ball and is asked by the footman for their names to be announced, the delegation replies in Irish.
