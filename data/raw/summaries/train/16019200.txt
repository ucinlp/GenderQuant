The setting is a farm on the slopes of a Karoo Kopje, South Africa, during the 1870s. Fat Tant Sannie  looks after her charges, the sweet Em  and the independent Lyndall , with a strict Biblical hand - it was Em's father's dying wish. Gentle Otto , the farm manager, runs the farm and cares for Waldo, his son. Waldo  is bright, and busy building a model of a sheep-shearing machine that he hopes will make them all rich. Things change when the sinister, eccentric Bonaparte Blenkins  with bulbous nose and chimney pot hat arrives. Their childhood is disrupted by the bombastic Irishman who claims blood ties with Wellington and Queen Victoria and so gains uncanny influence over the girls' gross stupid stepmother, Tant Sannie. As the story of Lyndall, Em and Waldo unfolds to its touching end, we learn not merely of a backwater in colonial history, but of the whole human condition. Olive Schreiner's intense story of three children living in the African veldt has often been compared to Emily BrontÃ«'s Wuthering Heights. Wildly controversial at publication  because of its feminist sentiments, the story has remained a touching and often wickedly funny portrayal of life on a late Victorian farm in South Africa.
