In the Framing Story, a psychiatrist in a high tech modern mental asylum, Dr. Tremayne , discusses a bold new psychiatric theory with colleague Dr. Nicholas . Tremayne uses four patients who went insane - Paul, Timothy, Brian, and Auriol - to illustrate the theory, presenting each in turn to Nicholas: In Mr. Tiger, Paul  is the sensitive and introverted young son of constantly bickering parents Sam  and Fay Patterson . Amid the unhappy domestic situation, he befriends an "imaginary" tiger. Features David Wood as Paul's tutor Phillipe. In Penny Farthing, Timothy  an antique store owner, stocks a strange portrait of "Uncle Albert"  and a penny farthing bicycle. In a series of episodes, Uncle Arthur compels Timothy to mount the bicycle, and he is transported to an earlier era where he observes the apparently mourning Beatrice , who was young Albert's love interest. These travels place Timothy's girlfriend Ann  in peril. Features Neil Kennedy and Richard Connaught as the removal men. In Mel, Brian Thompson  brings home an old dead tree, which he lovingly calls Mel, mounting it in his modern home as a bizarre piece of objet d'art. He increasingly shows unusual attention to Mel, angering his jealous wife Bella . In Luau literary agent Auriol Pageant  lasciviously courts a new client Kimo . However, he shows more interest in her beautiful young daughter Ginny . Auriol organises a sumptuous luau for him, as per the detailed instructions of Kimo's associate Keoki . However, it is actually a ceremony to assure Kimo's dying mother Malia  passage to "heaven" by appeasing a Hawaiian god, and a requirement is that he consume the flesh of a virgin: Ginny. Features Leslie Nunnerley as Vera. In the Epilogue, Nicholas has Tremayne himself declared insane, apparently for believing the patients' bizarre accounts, but manifestations of the patients' histories materialize, and "Mr. Tiger" kills Nicholas.
