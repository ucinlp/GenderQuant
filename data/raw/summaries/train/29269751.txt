Based on the true story of the Detroit Red Wings' Ted Lindsay, a nine-time NHL All-Star who, along with Doug Harvey of the Montreal Canadiens, headed up a small group of players in a battle to protect the rights of players against monopolistic NHL owners of the 1950s era, including Bruce Norris of the Detroit Red Wings, Conn Smythe of the Toronto Maple Leafs and James D. Norris of the Chicago Black Hawks as well as NHL president, Clarence Campbell. The film focusses on the conflict between Lindsay and Jack Adams, Detroit's general manager, as well as Lindsay's struggle to win over the trust and support of the players, including Lindsay's long-time team mate, the legendary Gordie Howe, amidst coercion and threats from the league and the owners. Lindsay's efforts would ultimately result in the formation of the NHL Players Association.
