Ina looses her loved teddy bear Nonno in the Metro after Christmas-shopping with her mum. An old man and his dog find Nonno and leave him at the post but he falls down into a bag which will go by train to Kiruna, where Anna who works at the post at the station finds him and brings him home. Later a boy called Per-Olof finds Nonno who has disappeared from Anna's family. When two girls are bad to him, he becomes angry and throws Nonno down on the motorway and Nonno lands on a truck which is going towards Stockholm. Later Nonno is for sale in an antique shop and Ina's older brother Jakob, who later comes back home from the United States, passes the shop and buyes Nonno.
