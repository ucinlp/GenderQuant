Sattar , owner of Good Luck Recovery Agency, is the saviour and the solution for all those caught in the debt trap. From Bhaigiri to business to politics to social work -- that's how Sattar wants to progress in life. He has already graduated from Bhaigiri to business and is now eager to jump into politics. Most sought after by banks, telecom companies and various multinationals, today his Good Luck Recovery Agency is a leading recovery agency. Sattar follows a simple rule when it comes to his business -- Loan liya hai to chukana padega. But will Sattar succeed in using this simple principle when dealing with disparate characters and cases like Anil-Shilpa , Chandrakant-Arjun , Ryan-Nancy  and Prerna ? Money crunch? Need a house? Looking at a car? Wanna travel abroad? Pick up a loan for just about everything today. The pesky calls at odd hours, the sweet talk and rosy picture painted by financial institutions, before you pick up a loan -- EMI picks up stories/incidents from real life. Interesting!
