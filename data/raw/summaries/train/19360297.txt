Spud wants to go camping and shoot lots of bears with Jackie, Chubby, and Farina. But his mother has forced him to look after his little brother Wheezer, who has the croup. In caring for his brother he must periodically apply ointment to his chest. He tells his friends he must stay home and grease Wheezer. He tries to get his sister Mary Ann to do this but she insists on going camping. Spud decides to merely go camping anyway and take both Wheezer and Mary Ann along. The gang all go together in an old dilapidated wagon guided by Dinah The Mule. The trip initially goes smoothly, but after some time two bootleggers who have themselves concealed in the area spot the gang and decide to try to get the gang to leave. One of the bootleggers dresses up like an ape in order to scare the gang away. While he scares the gang, the gang manages to trap the ape. Eventually the gang ends up leaving the forest due to a skunk spraying the area, not the bootlegger in the ape suit.
