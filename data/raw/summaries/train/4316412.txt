Isaac Barr  is a top-notch San Francisco Freudian psychiatrist, who has Diana Baylor  on the patient's couch. He is treating her for frightening and horrific childhood memories, which include images of her drunken father and his death in a fire for which she wasn't blamed. One night, Heather Evans  enters Barr's office and says she is Baylor's sister. She asks Barr for information about her sister's case. It is implied, as part of the treatment, that Isaac speak to Heather to find out more about her sister's past experiences and determine if she might provide information Diana has forgotten. Not long after, Heather seduces Isaac, and a steamy affair follows. The problem: Heather is married to Jimmy Evans , a violent and wealthy Greek gangster. She also has a way of embarrassing Jimmy in public by taking a sip of wine and then flipping into an attack of "pathological intoxication," which can end with the restaurant in shambles. It turns out Heather is trying to involve unsuspecting Isaac in a diabolical plan to murder Jimmy and collect a $4 million double indemnity life insurance policy on him. She's also using Diana as bait and wants Isaac framed for the murder.
