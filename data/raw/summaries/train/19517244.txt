Marta and Angela are Brooklyn roommates. Angela has lived in Brooklyn her whole life, Marta has recently arrived from South America. Marta becomes exploited by both the city and Angela's brother, Eddie. She desperately waits for her Chilean boyfriend, Alvaro to arrive and make things better. Marta, it seems, is a woman with her life on hold. She moved from Chile to get work as an actress in New York, but she spends all of her free time talking about and waiting for her boyfriend, Alvaro , to join her from Chile. Once he arrives, however, he is so supremely uninterested in her that he rarely makes eye contact with her and bolts from the apartment as soon as he dumps his stuff on the bed.by Steve Rhodes, http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/new_brooklyn/articles/1801319/exquisitely_constructed_it_gives_viewers_a_consistently_satisfying_experience_which_works_on_every_level_but_lewin_steals_the_movie_be_ready_to_have_your_heart_break, 03-9-2009, "Exquisitely constructed, it gives viewers a consistently satisfying experience, which works on every level.
