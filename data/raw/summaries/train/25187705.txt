Horaţiu  is an 8-year-old boy who still believes in Santa Claus. As a Christmas gift, his mother  takes him to the mall to buy him a gift. What might otherwise have been a normal day becomes an adventure when Horatiu gets lost. He meets Ion , a thief disguised as Santa Claus who is there to steal a diamond for Vandame  and his gang of fake Santas. Out of character for Santa Claus, Ion is rude and doesn’t seem to like kids. However, the boy believes he is the real Santa and decides to stay with him despite Ion's attempts to abandon the boy. As the day goes on, the two enter a series of dangerous yet funny misadventures. By the end of the day they become great friends, both learning something from each other. And because it is Christmas and miracles do happen, everyone gets their wish.
