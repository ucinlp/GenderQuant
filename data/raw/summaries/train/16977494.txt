Innerstate follows the journeys of three very different adults on similar paths. The subjects are Jason, diagnosed with psoriasis, Janie, diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, and Ray, diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, all diseases of the immune system, which may be characterized by immune deregulation, chronic inflammation and tissue damage. In total, they affect millions of people worldwide, while also having a profound impact on their families, friends and loved ones. The film opens with a long shot of a suburban highway, giving the viewer the distinct feeling of taking a road trip or journey. Through the film’s progression, first-hand accounts are intertwined to show how Jason, Janie and Ray, people with different illnesses and from different backgrounds, share an important bond with each other. Each has a unique story to tell, but their “inner states” are similar in that they found the strength to keep striving for their dreams by staying focused on overcoming their conditions.
