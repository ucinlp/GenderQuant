Lonnie Wilson , the son of a sharecropper, Zuba Wilson , returns to his small southern hometown of Clinton, Louisiana after spending six years on the chain-gang for killing Colonel Ben Marquand's son, Davey, in an automobile accident. He revives his love affair with Melinda Marquand , who is now Mrs. Melinda Thomas, having married Dr. Ned Thomas  while Lonnie was serving time in her place for the accident she caused.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053762/ IMDB Somewhat miffed about all this, Lonnie incites Dr. Ned about his wife's infidelity, which Dr. Ned verifies when he catches Lonnie and Melinda in a semi-torrid embrace in Colonel Marquand's hunting lodge. Melinda, looking for an explanation, shoots and wounds Lonnie to defend her innocence by claiming she was being raped. Colonel Marquand, who had bribed Lonnie to take the blame for his daughter, uses her story to have Sheriff Wheaton  kill Lonnie, thereby putting an end to all this mess. Mrs. Marquand  eventually faces Davey's death and realizes that she witnessed Melinda run down her little brother. Peter Marquand  and Ned return to the lodge and inform Otis that the charges against Lonnie are all lies. Exonerated, Lonnie gives Zuba the deed to the farm, and the old man dances in delight, thrilled to finally own his land.http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/89222/Desire-in-the-Dust/overview
