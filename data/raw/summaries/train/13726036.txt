Fatty plays a somewhat lazy young man who disrupts his mother's life by causing a fire by smoking in bed, then ruins laundry day by dropping it in the mud. He has two loves of his life, the girl next door Lizzie and his dog Luke. After showcasing his lack of talents helping his mother, he is able to save Luke from the dog catchers and express his love for Lizzie through a hole in the fence. In the second reel, Fatty, Lizzie, mom and Luke go to the amusement park, where Fatty is first outwitted by a couple of sharks but then retrieves his losses by pointing a fake gun at them. To extract revenge, they kidnap Lizzie with the help of the embittered dog catchers, and take her to an abandoned shack, where they tie her to a post with a gun attached to a timer pointed at her head. Plucky pup Luke follows the crooks, and is able to warn Fatty in time to perform the last-minute rescue, with the help of the Keystone Cops. In the closing shot Fatty, Lizzie and Luke embrace in a joint kiss .
