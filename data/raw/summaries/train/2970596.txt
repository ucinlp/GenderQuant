Twin girls Sarah and Julie are two naughty but sweet children that drive their work-obsessed widowed mother, Rhonda, up the wall. They overhear her saying that they are a "handful" and she needs a "vacation". They decide to go give Rhonda what she wants and head off to their great grandmother's house for Christmas. The girls pack up their bags and hop on their bicycles. But there's a problem; they aren't allowed to cross the street on their own. That's when the city bus pulls up and they sneak on through the back door. While riding the bus, an elderly lady tells them that it only goes Downtown, Uptown, and back. They also discover that Edgemont  is actually hours away. After getting off the bus Downtown, they spot Eddie  and his truck. They sneak into its back and only reveal themselves to him because Sarah desperately has to go to the bathroom. He doesn't like kids, but eventually starts to enjoy the girls' company after he figures out that he gets large tips when they deliver packages with him. He evens buys them ice cream, as well as a lottery ticket with the numbers of their birth date . After the day's deliveries are finished, he brings them home, only to be attacked by two robbers who steal his truck . When the robbers, Harvey and Shirley, discover them, they decide they can make some money by kidnapping them for ransom. Shirley makes a phone call to Rhonda, asking for $10,000 in cash. She tells her that they will make the trade at the ice rink in Edgemont, and that she is to wear a red hat. Meanwhile, Harvey has begun to like the girls and when he asks Shirley why they never had kids, she replies that it's because they are criminals. Sarah and Julie eventually get to their great-grandmother's house, and then Eddie and Rhonda  get together after he saves the girls. He wins the lotto of 1.3 million on a TV show. Afterwards, they give all the people their parcels back. At the end everybody is happy spending Christmas together.
