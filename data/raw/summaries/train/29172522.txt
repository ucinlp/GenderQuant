17 year-old Carol  flees her small-town home to escape from her alcoholic stepfather, and heads off to London to live with her aunt. Once in London she is drawn to the sleazy excitement of Soho and finds work in a coffee bar. She falls in love with handsome young nightclub singer Joe Shane  and soon they are a couple. She then discovers that Joe is a small-time crook on the side, with a gang background and a line in petty burglary. At work, Carol finds herself on the receiving end of advances from all manner of men, including her boss, Mort Wilson , who, though older, professes to be in love with her. When Carol becomes pregnant, Joe decides to do "one last job" to make the money to take them to a fresh start in Canada. He burgles Mort's house, but Mort catches him. After shooting Mort dead, Joe, himself severely wounded, goes on the lam with Caro.
