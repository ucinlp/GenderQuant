Three sideshow performers leave the circus after Tweedledee the midget assaults a child at one of their shows and become "The Unholy Three." Echo the ventriloquist assumes the role of Mrs. O'Grady, a kindly old grandmother, who runs a bird shop. Tweedledee, "The Twenty Inch Man," becomes her grandchild, and Hercules  is their assistant. Soon an incredible crime wave is launched from their little store. Convincingly disguised as a little old lady, Echo and his two carnival cohorts perform a series of Park Avenue robberies. Echo's sweetheart Rosie  plays along with the Unholy Three but changes her mind when their latest burglary, which ended in murder, threatens to send an innocent man  to the electric chair.
