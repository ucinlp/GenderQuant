At Asashi High, a run-down senior high school for boys, Kujo , Aoki , Yukio , Yoshimura  and Ota  are a gang of school friends lost in apathy and dissatisfaction. They are aware their future offers limited options. Even most teachers have already written them off as a lost cause. Kujo's gang is part of the school's illegal society, which is controlled through a rooftop game: the Clapping Game, which is a test of courage. Who wins the game gets to be the society's leader and rules all gangs throughout Asashi High. No teacher can stand up to the society. After a round of the Clapping Game, Kujo wins the leadership, which excites his best friend Aoki who wants Kujo to dominate the school with punches of casual violence, but Kujo passively resists. Aoki eventually realizes his best friend only took part in the Clapping Game to pass the time. Kujo never wanted to be the school's leader. Devastated, Aoki challenges Kujo for his leadership, and loses. As Aoki becomes disillusioned, alienated and hostile toward Kujo, friends around them slowly fall apart, bringing their school to a series of mini violent climaxes.
