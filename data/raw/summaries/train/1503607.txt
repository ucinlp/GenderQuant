Eat the Document includes footage from the infamous Manchester Free Trade Hall concert, wherein an audience member shouted "Judas!" during the electric half of Dylan's set. Dylan's band during these shows were The Hawks . Songs from various shows throughout the tour featured in the film include "Tell Me, Momma", "I Don't Believe You", "Ballad of a Thin Man", and "One Too Many Mornings." Other scenes include Dylan and Robbie Robertson in hotel rooms writing and working through new songs, most of which remain unreleased and unpublished. Among these songs are "I Can't Leave Her Behind", which was later covered by Stephen Malkmus for the I'm Not There soundtrack. The film also includes a piano duet with Johnny Cash performing Cash's "I Still Miss Someone".  Some bootleg versions of Eat the Document include a long scene featuring a possibly alcohol- or drug-impaired Dylan in a limousine with John Lennon on 27 May 1966. As Dylan shows signs of fatigue, Lennon urges him to get a grip on himself: "Do you suffer from sore eyes, groovy forehead, or curly hair? Take Zimdawn!...Come, come, boy, it's only a film. Pull yourself together."Mojo, Launch Issue, October 1993, p.60 Lennon would later recall in an interview with Rolling Stone that he and Dylan were "both in shades, and both on fucking junk, and all these freaks around us... I was nervous as shit. I was on his territory, that's why I was so nervous."Rolling Stone article: "The Rolling Stone Interview: John Lennon, Part II"There's a Riot Going On by Peter Doggett, p. 537.
