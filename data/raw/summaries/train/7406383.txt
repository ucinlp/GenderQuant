Taking place in the not too distant future, North and South Korean governments are on the verge of re-opening the Kyungui Railroad, which connects the two Koreas as a further step toward reunification, when Japan refuses to accept the decision, claiming rights to the railway lines based on official documents imprinted with the imperial seal of Emperor Gojong of Joseon a century ago. Yet an age old conspiracy is uncovered where the imperial seal with which Emperor Gojong signed the documents is suspected to be fake. It is a race against time and hidden agendas as the South Korean President  employs the outspoken historian Choi Min-jae  and the descendant of the Joseon royal bloodline Kim Yu-shik  to find the authentic seal and prevent the history of Japanese occupation from repeating itself. In the meantime, Japanese economic sanctions divide the Korean government, and its armed forces appear on the border of Korea threatening its sovereignty. Eventually, the authentic royal seal is found and Japan apologizes for its occupation.
