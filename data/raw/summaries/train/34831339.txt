In 1942, in the Swedish province of VÃ¤rmland bordering Nazi-occupied Norway, a group of Swedish soldiers leave their post at a check-point in neutral Sweden, and ends up on the wrong side of the borders. One soldier is killed and another captured by the Germans, and a rescue operation is underway. However, a Swedish colonel sends out an execution squad to eliminate the lost soldiers and their rescuers, in order to cover up the mistake. The lost Swedish soldiers now suddenly face two different enemies on their way home across the border.
