Gus is a film about a football-kicking mule  and his trainer "Andy" . The film opens with a soccer game, and the Petrovic family watching their son Stepjan win the soccer game. Their other son Andy Petrovic works on his farm in Yugoslavia, and can't play soccer at all. A soccer ball is behind his mule, Gus. After saying that he never wants to see a soccer ball again, Gus kicks the soccer ball a long distance. Andy tries it with him and he says, "Oyage!" and Gus kicks the ball. Meanwhile, the California Atoms are a team that cannot do anything right. Debbie Kovac, a woman with Yugoslavian parents gets the Yugoslavian papers, and once Hank Cooper and Coach Venner find out about Gus, they want him over. So with that, Andy and Gus fly over to California and Gus' kicking of the football gets them to agree to let them join the team.
