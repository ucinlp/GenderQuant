The film portrays Lukša's attempts, in trips to western Europe, to gain support for the armed anti-Soviet resistance , whose fortunes in a guerrilla war against Soviet authorities were waning, largely due to widespread infiltration and harsh crackdowns by the NKVD. The film depicts Lukša being killed in an ambush in Lithuania, although his body has never been found.
