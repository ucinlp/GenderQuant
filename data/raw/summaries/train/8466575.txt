A junkman is attacked by the Dead End Kids: Frankie , Squirt , Spike , Goofy , Fats , and Bugs , and suffers a concussion. When the court cannot convince the boys to divulge which one struck the damaging blow, they are all sent to reform school. The superintendent of the state reformatories, Mark Braden , visits the school and finds that it is being mismanaged. As a way of starting over, he fires Morgan , the cruel warden, and four ex-convict guards, while retaining the head guard, Cooper . Braden runs the school himself and attempts to parole the kids, while romancing Frankie's sister, Sue Warren . Meanwhile, Cooper is afraid that Braden will learn of Morgan's illegal use of the food budget, which would implicate him as well. He learns that Spike is the one who dealt the blow to the junkman and blackmails him. He gets him to tell Frankie that Braden is forcing Sue to pay for the special treatment the boys have received. Although untrue, it causes the kids to escape from the school. On the outside, they confront Braden and learn the truth. Cooper "discovers" that the kids have escaped and Morgan calls the press to discredit Braden and get him fired. Once the kids are back at the school and the police arrive, Braden delivers evidence about Morgan's fraud, and Morgan is arrested.
