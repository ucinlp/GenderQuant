The movie follows a man ([[Paul Jones  who is unnamed. The movie starts out with the central character in a car with a man  who just picked him up. The victim talks to him, but he's uninterested. The victim decides to pull over because he doesn't like the sound of the engine. While he's looking under the hood of the car the central character slams the hood down on him, decapitating him in the process. The central character eventually sews the head back on, and the victim wakes up. The central character tells him he doesn't want to drive anymore that day and to leave without him. A few years later the central character is called on to be part of a committee, groups that supposedly keep the system running but really don't do much of anything. He feels paranoid that the committee was called on account of him, and runs into the victim while there, who doesn't seem to remember him. The central character talks about this with a man listed as 'The committee director'  in the credits. This conversation lasts for the duration of the movie, and features most of the music Pink Floyd wrote for the film.
