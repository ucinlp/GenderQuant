At 1945, in the devastated city of Dresden, Karl 'Kalle' Bl√ºcher - a former worker in the cigarettes factory - returns home, wishing to resume his job. The chief of the reconstruction team explains that the plant cannot produce cigarettes without carbide. He assigns Kalle with the mission to obtain the material. The worker travels to Wittenberge and manages to secure nine barrels, but his return to Dresden turns into a long chain of comical incidents: at first, a war widow named Karla allows him to travel on her wagon. Afterwards, he encounters greedy American soldiers, Red Army troops who confiscate some of his barrels and other obstacles. Eventually, after many adventures, he brings two barrels back and marries Karla.
