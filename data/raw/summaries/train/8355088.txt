Buenos Aires, 1983. Christmas' Eve. Rey  and Isabel , two old college friends, bump into each other at a restaurant. It has been fifteen years since they last saw each other. Isabel has just returned from exile; Rey had just wanted to be alone, wrestling with his own personal demons. This by-chance encounter with Isabel takes Rey back to his college days when he was secretly in love with her. "A dos aguas"  is a look at the effects of years spent living under a brutal dictatorship and peoples' desperate rush to recover lost time. Perhaps more importantly, it depicts the pain of being an orphan in both a physical and spiritual sense.
