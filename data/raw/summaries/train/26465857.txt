Music by Prudence tells a self-empowering story of one young woman's struggle who, together with her band, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds and, in her own voice, conveys to the world that "disability does not mean inability." Zimbabwean singer-songwriter Prudence Mabhena was born severely disabled. The society she was born into considers disabilities to carry the taint of witchcraft.<ref namehttp://www.sfbayview.com/2010/oscar-nomination-for-%E2%80%98music-by-prudence%E2%80%99-about-disabled-zimbabwean-singer-prudence-mabhena/|title5 March 2010|publisher21 March 2010}} Because of this, many disabled children are abandoned.
