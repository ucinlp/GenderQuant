Quentin "Fifty Dollah" Waise  is involved in a crime ring that earns him good money but worries his grandmother , who dotes on him and encourages him to follow a more righteous path. Fifty Dollah's brother Miles "Foolish" Waise , whose grandmother gave him the nickname, is an aspiring comedian, but his inability to get his career going convinces his older sibling he's wasting his talents. The movie pays homage to several of Griffin's idols, such as Redd Foxx, who appear as feet under a bathroom stall while he gets ready for shows. These idols, it appears, seem to inspire Foolish to do well on his shows, which are widely attended and placed on last so as to keep people in the bars drinking. Meanwhile, Foolish also shows himself to have home trouble with his girlfriend, her son, and his seeming inability to keep his gigs going or getting any better after his grandmother dies. Fifty Dollah tries to get his own life in order and give Foolish the push he needs, he also has to deal with a sudden conflict with criminal leader Eldorado Ron  and a painful romantic triangle when he and Foolish fall for the same woman .
