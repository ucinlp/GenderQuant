A parody of The Human Centipede, in 'The Human Sexipede', Dr. Heiter kidnaps two young American girls and an Asian man, all of whom are unable to achieve sexual satisfaction through everyday sexual behaviour. He presents them with the idea of joining them mouth to genitals, so that they are able to continually pleasure each other by way of oral sex and finally achieve sexual satisfaction.
