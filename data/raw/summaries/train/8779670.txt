Buck Caesar ([[Stanley Fields  is a paroled convict who makes a contribution to a reform school on the advice of his nephew, Jim Donahue , a lawyer. Jim feels that the boys in the reform school, including Tony , Gyp , Joey , Bongo , Ace , and "Ouch" , could benefit from the contribution and he believes the publicity from it will help his uncle. The superintendent, Krispan ([[Grant Mitchell , does not want the contribution to lead to an audit, as he has been carrying two sets of financial books. He gets a professional hockey team to substitute for the team his school will be playing. His reasoning is that Buck will place a large bet on the school and lose, thereby getting him angry and possibly violent, which would violate his parole and send him back to prison. Buck does proceed to get angry and punches the opposing coach and then hides to avoid arrest. Krispan continues in his role as ruler of the school, which had deteriorated under Buck's influence. As punishment for their actions while Buck was around, Krispan locks Joey into a freezer and he dies. The other kids revolt and Buck comes out of hiding to aid them. The kids capture Krispan and make him go through a trial where they convict him to "join Joey". Buck, however, has gone to the police and they arrive in time to stop them. Krispan is punished through the proper legal channels and Buck returns to prison for violation of parole.
