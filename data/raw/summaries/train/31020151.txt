This film is similar to the breezy love stories that come from the stables of Yogaraj Bhat and Preetham Gubbi. Its upbeat and modern approach, good clothes, good looking people and great locales, make it a multiplex winner — a formula Sandalwood’s young brigade has adopted. The film is about two youngsters, both of whom are quite the ideal children. Imagine a girl who makes a guy wait hoping to get her parents to approve his proposal; or a guy who says, “I’ve met the girls parents, I see them in her eyes”. These are the stuff most of the typical families dream of, as they plan their kids’ futures. The film has its funny moments and occasionally, an overdose of sentimental scenes. The director has done a fairly decent job with the narrative and Yash impresses in his role as the lovelorn urban lad. His dancing skills deserve special mention — he’s easily one of the best we have in Sandalwood. New girl Bhama makes a decent debut, though Deepu, who has dubbed for her, deserves equal applause. Rangayana Raghu and Tara excel, the film shows Raghu in a different light, as opposed to his over-the-top comical roles.
