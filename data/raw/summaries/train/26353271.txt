There is going to be a wedding in the family, and a father and son journey all the way from Punjab, India to London, U.K. to participate in the ceremony. Once in London, they come to know that the neighbourhood is being terrorized by Caucasian skinheads, who want to drive all Asians away, back to the countries of their birth. The son stands up against the skinheads, and even beats up quite a few of them. When the leader of the skinheads, Cain, comes to know about this incident, he asks his men not to interfere with this Indian male, as the skinheads are not the only ones who hate Indians - the Pakistanis hate them more, and Cain decides to kill two birds with one stone, and do what the East India Company did in the 19th century - divide and rule. But then Cain finds out that the Pakistani befriends the Indians. Cain kills the Pakistani. Later the protagonist beats up Cain and gets him arrested for the murder of Aslam Qureshi.
