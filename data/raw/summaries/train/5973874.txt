A German secret document is stolen and Usmarte , the actual thief, lures Bugs Bunny into taking it. General Pandemonium  gets a frantic call from Foghorn Leghorn saying the secret document has been stolen, and immediately heads for the Carrotblanca nightclub---the Cafe Au Lait Americain. Meanwhile Sylvester Slazlo  and his wife Kitty Ketty  arrive at the hotel. Ketty attracts the unwanted attention of Captain Louis  but she scratches him and throws him into the wall. Ketty, who happens to be a former girlfriend of Bugs, asks Daffy Duck  to play her favorite song. General Pandemonium suspects Sylvester may know about the document and binds him in his office. Ketty pleads with Bugs to help Sylvester out of this. Though Bugs is initially reluctant due to the fact that Ketty broke his heart, he goes to the General's office nevertheless and confuses the General himself into jail. The story climaxes with Sylvester and Ketty escaping on the plane for Toronto, New York City and Cucamonga, as Bugs watches them go... except that they find Louis on the plane working as a steward. Louis asks Ketty, "Coffee, tea, or moi?", causing her to jump out, seemingly without a parachute, landing right in front of Bugs. They kiss, then the parachute opens, covering them. The Warner Bros. Family Entertainment logo appears with "That's All Folks!" written on top of it and Tweety says  "That's All Folks" and the cartoon ends. This cartoon contains the Looney Tunes-logo, but the Merrie Melodies-leader can be heard.
