Carpathia, 1851: Elvira and her maidservant Zou Zou , on their way to a can-can revue in Paris, get kicked out of an inn for a slight monetary discrepancy. She is rescued by a local who takes her to stay at the castle in the hills high above the village. The fact that she happens to resemble the count's  former "missing" wife opens a can of worms for the two.
