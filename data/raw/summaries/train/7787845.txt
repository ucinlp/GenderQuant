Judith Moore had what she thought was a perfect marriage, both she and her husband studying to be doctors. But after she puts her studies on hold to find a job and support them, her husband promptly leaves Judith to be with another doctor. Depressed, she holes up in her apartment, where the middle-aged Pat Francato serves as a building superintendent and elevator operator. He is as lonely as she is, beset with gambling problems, and for a moment Judith and Pat make a connection. Unfortunately, what he wishes to pursue as a romantic relationship, Judith sees only as a friendship. Her friend Liz Bailey, who sings at a nightclub, makes attempts to improve Judith's love life as well as her own. By the time Judith's loneliness becomes overwhelming and she misses what she had with Pat, a sweet person and good listener, it is too late -- he has found someone else.
