Overland with Kit Carson is constructed upon a seemingly simple premise. Old Western settlers are being driven off their homesteads and ranches by a combination of Indian assaults and harassing attacks by bands of mysterious outlaws. Then, the US government sends out famed Indian scout Kit Carson and army officer David Brent to investigate the facts, and Carson discovers that a mysterious villain known only as Pegleg, who enjoys planning his misdeeds as much as carrying them out, controls an outlaw gang called the Black Raiders and is using them and the Indians to drive out the settlers so he can establish his own empire. By 1939, film-goers knew exactly what to expect from a western serial: a clean-cut, self-assured hero facing down a good-for-nothing villain in a tireless pursuit, the menacing Indians and gun-toting bad guys, the moral soldier and the pretty girl, a reckless boy, lots of action, the climactic final gunfight, and not much in the way of thematic depth.
