Esther Hoffman, an aspiring female singer/songwriter meets John Norman Howard, a famous, successful and self-destructive male singer/songwriter, whom, after a series of coincidental meetings, she finally start dating. Believing in her talent, John gives her a helping hand and her career begins to eclipse his. Writer and director Frank Pierson, in his New West magazine article "My Battles With Barbra and Jon" summarized it this way: "An actress is a little more than a woman, an actor a little less than a man  ... The woman in our story is ambitious to become a star, but it is not necessary: it can make her happier and richer, but she could give it all away and not be a better or worse person. With stardom she is only a little more than a woman. For the man, his career is his defense against a self-destructive part of himself that has led him into outrageous bursts of drunkenness, drugs, love affairs, fights and adventures that have made him a legend. His career is also what gives him his sense of who he is. Without it, he is lost and confused; his demons eat him alive. That's why he is a little less than a man. And it is not that her success galls him, or that she wins over him; the tragedy is that all her love is not enough to keep alive a man who has lost what he measures his manhood with."{{Cite quote}} And so the conclusion is measured by the theme. He takes his life in the mistaken belief that he will then not drag her down with him.
