A young alien, Stu, is inside a spaceship taking an examination in abduction. He must snatch a sleeping farmer named Ernie  under the watchful eye of his impassive examiner, a gelatinous blob named Mr. B.Pixar.com - Lifted Working from memory, Stu is expected to use an array of thousands of unlabeled toggle switches for this purpose, and Mr. B gives no hints of which one to use. Stu's hesitant flicks of the switches turn out to be wrong, causing Ernie to bump into the walls and ceiling but not waking him up. Frustrated, Stu yells and swipes randomly at the array; Ernie bounces crazily around the room like a pinball, knocking over the furniture in the process. Eventually, after checking his notes, Stu does succeed in maneuvering Ernie out the window and up into the ship, but he shuts off the tractor beam without closing the cargo hatch. As Ernie plummets toward the ground, Mr. B takes over and catches him, then works the switches with incredible speed to put him back in his bed and clean up the mess Stu made. Ashamed over his failure, Stu starts whimpering and tries to hold back his tears. Mr. B generously allows him to launch the spaceship for the trip home. Stu cheerfully grabs the steering yoke and begins to maneuver; a moment later it slams to the ground, crushing Ernie's house. When it lifts off, its underside is covered with dirt and debris and nothing is left of the house except a tall pillar of dirt in the center of a crater, cut out by the open cargo hatch. Atop this, Ernie is still sound asleep in bed. As the end credits run, the sound of Ernie's alarm clock is heard, followed by his yawn, a scream, and a thud - he has fallen into the crater.
