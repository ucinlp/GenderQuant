{{Expand section}} The Bradley family and their friends gather at an isolated country home to celebrate Thanksgiving. But unknown to the Bradleys, they have an uninvited guest. A giggling, PCP-addled, homicidal maniac has escaped from imprisonment to satisfy his pent-up lust for murder. And he has singled out their home for his psychopathic killing spree. One by one, the revelers will be methodically stalked and served up in the butcher's holiday blood feast. Until the Bradley's home becomes a grisly house of horrors.
