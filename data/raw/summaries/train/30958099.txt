Real Pests is a light-hearted comedy about a widower Štebe , who works as a bus driver and lives with his five adolescent sons and an elderly maid Rozi  in Ljubljana. The boys are wild, constantly playing pranks on neighbors and Rozi, who is fed up with their behavior which earned them the nickname "gadi" . One day, she fulfills her threat and leaves for home in the countryside despite being extremely fond of the family. Right then, Rozi's young niece Meri  comes to town and is offered a place to stay by Štebe until she can find a job. The attractive Meri cannot compete with Rozi at housekeeping, but she immediately wraps all the boys around her finger, also getting attention from Štef's coworker Toni  with whom she later becomes a couple. However, nobody seems to know where she is going every afternoon. Finally, Štebe, who knows Rozi very well, convinces her to come back. At the same time, the mystery about Meri is also solved: she had been learning to drive a bus and has just passed the driving test, becoming a driver at the city transport company. Everybody boards her bus and they drive off.
