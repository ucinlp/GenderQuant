Marley Corbett, a carefree woman with a promising career, great friends, and witty sense of humor, learns that she has terminal cancer. She is told the news by Dr. Julian Goldstein, a successful doctor with a hardened exterior, who is deeply impressed and affected by the way Marley accepts the news of her fate with humor and dignity. The movie opens up on a random day showing Marley heading to work. As the movie unfolds, clues of Marley's illness are shown: unexplained weight-loss, etc. Not even half way through the movie, she learns she is suffering from colon cancer. Throughout the movie, there are scenes that show how carefree Marley's life once was, before the diagnosis. Prior to her diagnosis, Marley thought she had everything she could ever want in life, living in a state of dreamy eternity. Marley makes an appointment for an endoscopy. While under anesthesia, God appears to Marley as played by Whoopie Goldberg. In her dream, Marley makes three wishes: money, to fly and a third that is later revealed. From there, Marley and Julian find themselves falling in love, and doing their best to make the most of the time they have left.
