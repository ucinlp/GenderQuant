The Stooges are phone repairmen who are mistaken for the psychiatrists in whose office they are working, Drs. Z. Ziller , X. Zeller , and Y. Zoller . Wealthy J. Rumsford Rumford , upon the recommendation of a doctor friend of his, hires them to treat his impetuous young wife, Sherry Rumford , who is always running off on her guests for one crazy reason or another. The Stooges ruin their clients' dinner party in their usual style, but because their antics so amuse his wife, her husband believes that she is cured and the Stooges are paid handsomely for their efforts.
