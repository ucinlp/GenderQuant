The four Angel sisters are singers, although all wish to pursue other careers. At a roadhouse, bandleader Happy Marshall makes a pass at Nancy Angel, but she already has a boyfriend, cab driver Oliver. After the girls are paid just $10 for a performance, Bobby Angel gambles with her sisters' money and wins $190. But she is conned out of it by Happy, whose band needs it to make a trip to Brooklyn to perform at a club. Bobby thinks he wants to both hire and romance her, neither of which is true. Happy ends up falling for Nancy, and the girls' act is so good, the club's owner won't hire Happy's band in the future without them. Nancy's fine with the arrangement, particularly when Bobby ends up falling for Happy's friend in the band, Fuzzy.
