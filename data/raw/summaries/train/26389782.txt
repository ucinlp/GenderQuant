The story opens with a hunched old man, Pete Jensen, who lives in a shack in the town of Furnace Flats. He slaughters a goat and daubs its blood within a pentagon drawn on the floor of his shack. A young man, Nick Richards, comes to town, claiming that the old tramp was his uncle. Everyone notices that even though it's incredibly hot, the young man doesn't so much as have a drop of sweat on him. The Devil proceeds to run a gas station which he uses as a base to do some petty interfering in the lives of a few locals, driving a wedge between Nell Lucas and David Simpson after Simpson's dog attacks him and mauls his face. Nick Simpson seems to be behind all this, and further animal-related incidents occur - for instance, a local drunk is trampled by a horse, and a rattler gets in to attack Simpson in his bedroom. The sheriff goes to the shack and finds a buried goat .Ultimately, Nick dies and transforms back into his human shape, having had it revealed that he was behind the various animal-inflicted maulings and killings. At this point, David Simpson's facial wound miraculously disappears and the film ends on a happy note with the townsfolk characters standing over Nick's body in a field.
