The movie's protagonist is Mark Watson , the pampered son from a rich family who is about to attend Harvard Law School along with his best friend Gordon . However, all of a sudden his father's neurotic psychiatrist talks his patient into having more fun for himself instead of spending money on his son. Faced with the horrifying prospect of having to pay for law school by himself, Mark decides to take up a scholarship, but the only suitable one is for African Americans only. So he decides to cheat by using tanning pills in a larger dose than prescribed to appear as an African American. Watson then sets out for Harvard, naïvely believing that blacks have no problems at all in American society. However, once immersed in a black student's life, Mark finds that people are less lenient than he imagined and more prone to see him as a black person instead of a fellow student. He meets a young African-American student named Sarah Walker , whom he first only flirts with; gradually, however, he genuinely falls in love with her. As it turns out, she was the original candidate for the scholarship which he had usurped, and now she has to work hard as a waitress to support herself and her son George while studying. Slowly, Mark begins to regret his deed, and after a chaotic day—in which Sarah, his parents  and his classmate Whitney , who is also his landlord's daughter, drop in for surprise visits at the same time—he drops the charade and openly reveals himself to be white. The film ends with Mark declaring to his professor  that he wishes to pay back the scholarship and do charity work to make amends for his fraud, and Sarah decides to give him another chance.
