Middle-aged Sam Dodsworth is the head of Dodsworth Motor Company, an automobile manufacturing firm. His wife Fran, a shallow and vain woman obsessed with the notion of growing old, convinces her spouse to sell his interest in the company and take her to Europe. Before long, Fran begins to view herself as a sophisticated world traveler and Sam as boring and unimaginative. Searching for excitement in her life, she begins spending time with other men and eventually informs Sam that she's leaving him for a member of the nobility. Sam remains in Europe, seeing the sights, but otherwise drifting aimlessly. While in Italy, Sam reunites with Edith Cortright, a divorcee he first met aboard the Queen Mary en route to Europe, and the two fall in love. When Fran's plans to marry the nobleman fall through and she calls off the divorce, Sam rejoins her on a ship to sail back to America. In the climactic scene, Sam realizes his marriage to Fran is over. He gets off the ship at the last moment to rejoin Edith after he realizes just how much he cares for her.
