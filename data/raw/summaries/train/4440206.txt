The film is based on the story of Elizabeth BÃ¡thory, a 16th&ndash;17th century Hungarian countess. Her story takes place in a part of the Kingdom of Hungary, now Slovakia. She is infamous for killing many young women because &ndash; according to legend &ndash; she thought that bathing in their blood would preserve her youth. Eventually the royal authorities investigated, and she was walled up in her castle, where she died four years later. Juraj Jakubisko declared in an interview: {{quotation}}
