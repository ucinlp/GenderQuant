Lana Turner plays Adriana Roman, a successful stage actress who retires to marry Charles Winthrop , a wealthy tycoon. Winthrop's daughter, Lisa , is instantly distrustful of Adriana. When Charles is killed in a boating accident, Lisa's new boyfriend Johnny  capitalizes on that distrust to lead Lisa to believe that her father's death was murder – a charge exacerbated by Adriana's threat, as per her late husband's instructions, to disinherit Lisa if she marries Johnny. Johnny and Lisa conspire secretly to dose Adriana's sleeping pills with enough LSD to drive her insane. Though they accomplish their goal – and Adriana is committed to a mental hospital – a playwright friend of Adriana's  suspects foul play. He writes a play detailing Adriana's traumatic experiences and casts her in the lead role, hoping that replaying her experience on stage will cure her.
