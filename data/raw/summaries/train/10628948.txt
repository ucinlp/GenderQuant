Vaanavaraayan  plays the role of a feudal chieftain, adored and respected by his village people. He lives with his grandparents (M. N. Nambiar & [[Manorama . Following his advice, they abstain from voting in the elections and instead, pool the money given by the candidates to get themselves some basic amenities. Vallavaraayan ([[Napoleon  is his arch enemy. Their enmity is further sharpened when Vaanavaraayan wins the hand of Vaitheeswari , whom Vallavaraayan had also wished to wed. So Vallavaraayan convinces the priest at the temple to mix a poison in the holy water that Vaitheeswari drinks. As a result she becomes incapable of conceiving. But surprisingly, Vaitheeswari soon becomes pregnant-though she has pretended with the help of the mid-wife , to do so to uphold her husband's honor. She takes poison and kills herself unable to bear the grief of being incapable of giving her husband a child and on her deathbed makes Vaanavarayan swear to take Ponni  as his wife. Vaanavarayan however refuses until Ponni agrees to marry Sembattai - Vallavarayan's hechman-who abandons her to Vallavarayan's vice. Infuriated Vaanavarayam attacks Vallavarayam and spares his life after giving him a sermon on how to win the heart of people. Vaanavarayan marries Ponni in the end and has a daughter he names Vaitheeswari . http://rajinifans.com/review/ejamaan.php | 3rd Paragraph
