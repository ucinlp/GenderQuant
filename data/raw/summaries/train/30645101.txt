Alba  seduces a stranger Natasha  at a club . Alba invites Natasha to her hotel room in what seems merely a harmless sexual adventure crowning their last night in Rome. Natasha is at first reluctant - she insists she likes men and is not a lesbian. Alba says that many who experience lesbian relationships never go back to men. It is clear that Alba has done this before. However, through stories, memories and interaction with artworks in the room, the two connect tremendously, descending more and more into the depths of truth, trust, and ultimately love. The lovers eventually agree to part ways, returning to their previous lives in Russia and Spain. However, the ending of the film is ambiguous.
