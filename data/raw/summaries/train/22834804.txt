On land, on the high seas and high in the sky, the SBT members do their best to repel the forces of evil. On their mission, they find themselves in London where, for their meritorious service to the free world, the Queen knights them as Dames.  Now, they must locate and erase a black market copy of the infamous Los Alamos hard drive. They must prevent INTERR, the nefarious international terrorist organization, and one of their key representatives, Hakim , from possessing the top secret schematics for high level nuclear triggering mechanisms and weapons system. The SBT are trained in close quarters combat, improvised weapons and modern tactical warfare methods by the extremely secretive CSD, the Covert Situations Division of the Swedish Military.
