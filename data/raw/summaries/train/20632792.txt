A zoo elephant breaks free of its tether and follows The Pink Panther out of the zoo. Pink orders it back, but the zoo is closed. Sympathetic to the elephant's sadness, Pink takes it home. He battles wits with his apartment manager, who is in bed trying to sleep while Pink attempts to push the elephant into various rooms and beds. Eventually the elephant finds a bed, which then collapses through several floors squashing both Pink and the apartment manager.
