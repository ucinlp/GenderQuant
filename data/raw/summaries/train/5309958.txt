The special begins with a musical number showing that Beansboro Elementary School is canceled for the day due to a seven-inch snowfall. While the adults incessantly complain about the problems snow and ice cause, the children enjoy the opportunity to play in it. We then see Holly DeCarlo , a relatively lonely young girl and aspiring magician with only one friend, a tone-deaf, somewhat geeky character named Charles who has a knack for climatology. While practicing a magic act with Charles, Holly's hat blows off her head, out the window, and onto a snowman who comes to life as Frosty , thus revealing that Holly's hat was "that old silk hat" featured in the original song and previous adaptations. Meanwhile, evil Mr. Twitchell  is the inventor of "Summer Wheeze", an aerosol spray that makes snow instantly disappear.http://www.cbspressexpress.com/cbs-entertainment/releases/view?id=33324 He hopes to use the product to win over the people of Beansboro so that he will be crowned King of the Bensboro Winter Carnival. When one of the members of the town council voices concern about the environmental impact of the untested product, Mr. Twitchell has her dropped through a trapdoor. To Twitchell's delight, and Frosty's dismay, the town of Beansboro falls head over heels for "Summer Wheeze" which makes Frosty concerned about his safety. Although many of their classmates rally for the elimination of snow, only a day after singing about its virtues, Holly and Charles take on the duties of protecting Frosty, including hiding him in a freezer and securing refuge for him in an ice castle built for the Carnival. Later, Holly gets Frosty to appear at the Winter Carnival in an attempt to persuade the townspeople to rethink their hatred of snow. Singing about the joy of winter, Frosty is unanimously declared king of the carnival while still allowing Mr. Twitchell to wear the cape and ride in the sled of the carnival king.
