Two nerds, Nelson and Adam book a room at an inexpensive hotel in Ft. Lauderdale for a great time on Spring break, where they meet Stu and O.T. from Brooklyn, New York, also there to have fun. The hotel has overbooked the room so Nelson, Adam, Stu and O.T. agree to share the room due to the shortage of hotel rooms. The Wet T-shirt contests, beer drinking and other illicit activities associated with Spring Break are all on display here. Nelson's step-dad shows up and causes trouble for the group; he is paired with a building inspector who threatens to shut down the hotel .
