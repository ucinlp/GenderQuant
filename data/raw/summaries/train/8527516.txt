In Campbell's film, a writer, a producer and a director are hired by seedy erotic film producer Benny U. Murdoch  to make a dirty movie based on the poem. However, they run into difficulty when each of the production's backers want a completely different style of film made. Then Murdoch makes off with the money, and the three have to produce four different versions of the movie to keep everybody happy - a gay Western, a hardcore porno, a family version and a Kung Fu-style production.
