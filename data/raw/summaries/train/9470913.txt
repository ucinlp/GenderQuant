A poet marries a peasant girl. Their wedding reception follows. The celebration of the new marriage moves on from the church to the villager's house. In the rooms adjoining that of the wedding party, guests continually burst into arguments, make love, or simply rest from their merriment, dancing and feasting. Interspersed with the real guests are the well-known figures of Polish history and culture, who represent the guilty consciences of the characters. The two groups gradually begin a series of dialogues. The Poet  is visited successively by the Black Knight, a symbol of the nation's past military glory; the Journalist , then by the court jester and conservative political sage Sta≈Ñczyk; and the Ghost of Wernyhora , a paradigm of leadership for Poland. Wernyhora presents the Host with a golden horn symbolizing the national mission, and calls the Polish people to a revolt. One of the farm hands is dispatched to sound the horn at each corner of Poland, but he loses the horn soon after. {{cquote}}
