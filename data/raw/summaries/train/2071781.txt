Michael Bannon , a wealthy but bored businessman, issues the code word "Gumball" to his fellow automobile enthusiasts, who gather in a garage in New York City to embark on a coast-to-coast race "with no catalytic converter and no 55-mile-per-hour speed limit." Their nemesis, the evil LAPD Lieutenant Roscoe , also learns of the race and most of the film is devoted to the adventures of the various driving teams and Roscoe's ineffectual attempts to apprehend them. A number of running gags ensue – the Jaguar that will not start; the silent Lapchick's  numerous mishaps; Italian race driver Franco Bertolli's  frequent detours to seduce beautiful women – as well as some splendid stunts and driving sequences. The race ends at the Queen Mary in Long Beach, California where the finishers celebrate their adventures and the defeated Roscoe sulks off to one side – until a fleet of police cars and tow trucks, all in conspiracy with Roscoe, arrive to impound the vehicles; as it proves, Roscoe had contrived in advance to see to it that all of them were guaranteed to be illegally parked. Bannon congratulates Roscoe on his final victory and again utters the command "Gumball" to initiate a race back to New York.
