Some Mexican mice see the Guadalajara Food Processing Plant and try to enter there, only to be chased out by Sylvester. The pussycat then yells: "And stay out of here, you rodents" and starts guarding. The hungry mice then call Speedy Gonzales to help them get food. Speedy steals some cheese, but when he goes back, Sylvester starts chasing him. They end up on a conveyor belt, where Sylvester gets shaved by some chopping blades. Speedy spreads some grease on a platform, and Sylvester skids into a vat of Tabasco Sauce. He melts a block of ice to recover. On another conveyor belt, Sylvester gets a bottle cap pressed onto his head. He pries it off with a bottle opener, but Speedy "yee-ha's" him into the ceiling where it gets stuck again, and Speedy hides his bottle opener. Sylvester wanders off, trying to club Speedy but unable to because of his lack of sight, and his aimless wandering lands him in a dehydrator. He emerges from the dehydrator in a miniature size , but then Speedy, who is now larger than the cat, greets him: , prompting the tiny Sylvester to run away in fright.
