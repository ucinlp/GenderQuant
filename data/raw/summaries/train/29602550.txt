A few months after Ina left the position as the President of the Philippines, she is back in the media limelight as she releases a book of her life in her journey as a mother to her children and as a mother to the people of the Philippines. Ina now lives a simple life with her beloved children, together with her long-time best friend, Rowena. After a freak accident at President Ren's wedding, Ina found herself doing an X-ray and medical examinations inside a hospital. The doctor who examined Ina's health told her that she is suffering from brain tumor and only has 6 to 8 months to live due to the fractures found in her skull and some complications found in her medical results. Upon knowing this, Ina is having a hard time telling her children that she only has a few months to live. Ina is also having visions of her departed husbandsâ€”or so it would appear at first. Ina was very sick of her children fighting. She thought Juan, her first son, was in New Zealand but he's actually living on the streets. Pip had a daughter named Monay. And Tudis keeps fighting with her husband, Troy, because of her daughter being with another man. When Ina's children knew about her sickness, they were heartbroken and decided to change for the better, especially Juan and Tri. When yet another accident occurred, Ina was rushed to the hospital, where Rowena was due give birth, Six and Ten-Ten came, but Por was not there. Ina thought that the light that she saw was God, who was about to take her. But it was actually a light from a shooting. Then, another doctor claimed that Ina was not sick. Ina and her family then enjoyed a happy life together. Then came the Christening of Rowena's daughter when Frank came and he was accepted. After which, it was Seven's wedding to William.
