Set in the summer of 1978, Lucy and Norman, a young married couple whose relationship is going through a rough patch, decide to visit an English friend, Paul, who lives with his Spanish wife Isabel in the Basque Country. Standing in an isolated spot in the middle of the forest, the house seems the ideal spot for a quiet stay and the chance for Lucy and Norman to sort out their emotional problems. However, their peace is shattered when Paul and Norman discover a cabin in the forest in which a girl with ectrodactyly is imprisoned. Their attempts to take the girl to the police are hampered by the difficulties of the heavily wooded terrain and the intervention of a group of villagers who are determined to keep the girl locked away for good.
