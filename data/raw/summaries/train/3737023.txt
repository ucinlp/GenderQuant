On Saturday afternoon, 5 April 1941, one day before the Nazi invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, a colourful group of random passengers on a country road deep in the heart of Serbia board a dilapidated Krstić & Son bus, headed for the capital Belgrade: two Gypsy musicians, a World War I veteran, a Germanophile, a budding singer, a sickly looking man, and a hunter with a rifle. The bus is owned by Krstić Sr., and driven by his impressionable son Miško. Along the way, they are joined by a priest and a pair of young newlyweds who are on their way to the seaside for their honeymoon, and are faced with numerous difficulties: a flat tire, a shaky bridge, a farmer who's ploughed over the road, a funeral, two feuding families, Krstić Jr.'s recruitment into the army, and a lost wallet. All these slow the bus down and expose rifts among the travelers. During the early morning of Sunday, 6 April, amid rumours of war, they finally reach Belgrade only to be caught in the middle of Luftwaffe's raid . The only surviving passengers are two Gypsy musicians who sing the film's theme song before the end.
