His grandmother gets this news and rushes to see him.Here, she reveals that Rangadu is Ramachandrarao’s elder brother’s son and how the couple saved Rangadu’s mother. Bhushanam traps the family and tries to grab the property, but Rangadu rescues everyone..and in the effort, his cousin Radha gets killed. Chiru’s action, especially his timing in comedy, and his fights standout in this movie.The climax fight, where chiru is dragged by horses was well shot and Chiranjeevi displays his skill in few breathtaking shots. Overall a neat entertainer for every movie lover.
