Myles Falworth  and his sister Meg  live in obscurity on a farm in Crosbey-Dale with their guardian Diccon Bowman ([[Rhys Williams . This is to protect them from the attainder placed upon their family by King Henry IV of England  because their father has been  accused of treason and murdered by the Earl of Alban ([[David Farrar . When a hunting party comprising the Earl of Alban, the lord of Crosbey-Dale, and another nobleman, Sir Robert, stop at their farm for refreshment, they are repulsed by Myles to stop them molesting his sister. This confrontation accelerates Diccon's plans to send them to Mackworth Castle. The Earl of Mackworth , a close friend of their father, becomes their protector, and he sees in Myles the man who can rid England of the evil machinations of the Earl of Alban. Myles is trained to be a knight, is knighted by the king, and kills the Earl of Alban in trial by combat, foiling Alban's attempt to seize the English crown. Myles then marries the Earl of Mackworth's daughter, Lady Anne .
