A king, seated on the throne, says to official court jester Dapper Denver Dooley, "Make me laugh, jester." The jester does his best to comply, but his gags are old and stale, and they evoke no response from the king. The king goes to the window and sees Woody Woodpecker busy in a tree. Woody's antics so please the king that he laughs long and loud, and he orders the jester to bring Woody to him. The jester, now on a horse, orders the drawbridge openes, and he starts out of the castle. A knight boat whistles for clearance, and the drawbridge quickly raises. Jester and horse run smack into it. The jester again tries and finally gets near the tree where Woody's located. The jester, knowing that his job's at stake, has no desire to take Woody to the king, and he uses all kinds of tricks and devices to try to eliminate the competition. Woody outwits the jester, and we finally see Woody, in the jester's costume, before the king, with the jester tied to a stool. The king says to Woody, "Make me laugh, jester." Woody throws a soft, mushy pie into the ex-jester's face. As we fade out, the king's really having a big laugh for himself.
