This film is set in Harlem, of which 110th Street is an informal boundary line. By-the-book African-American Lieutenant William Pope  has to work with crude, racist but streetwise Italian-American Captain Frank Mattelli  in the NYPD's 27th precinct. They are looking for three black men who slaughtered seven men&mdash;three black gangsters and two Italian gangsters, as well as two patrol officers&mdash;in the robbery of $300,000 from a Mafia-owned Harlem policy bank. Mafia lieutenant Nick D'Salvio  and his two henchmen are also after the hoods. Paul Benjamin plays the troubled Jim Harris, who is the last of the surviving robbers; he makes his choice in the emotional climax. In one of many violent scenes, D'Salvio finds getaway driver Henry J. Jackson  and brutalizes him in a Harlem whorehouse.
