Henry Tawes is an aging sheriff in small-town Tennessee who is becoming bored with his wife Ellen and his life. He meets young Alma McCain and is drawn to her, even though she isn't even half his age. Alma seduces him, then persuades Tawes to provide protection for her father Carl McCain, who makes moonshine whiskey with an illegal still. Tawes obliges her until a federal agent, Bascomb, turns up. He obeys orders and destroys the still. A deputy, Hunnicutt, suspects that Tawes and the young woman are romantically involved. When he tries to take Alma by force, Hunnicutt is killed by the McCains. Tawes helps dispose of the deputy's body. He decides to take off with Alma and start a new life in California, but finds to his surprise that she and her family have already left. Tawes pursues them, assuming Alma still wants to be with him, but she has other ideas.
