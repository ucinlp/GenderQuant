In 1970, Tahar, a young Tunisian travels to France for the first time, sent by his family to help his elder brother, wrongly accused of murder and incarcerated in Paris. His first stop is in Marseille, where he meets some Tunisians who are very different from those back home, enigmatic French people and a disturbing atmosphere that makes him doubt what he thought he was sure of: His brotherâ€™s innocence, his own innocence and his own mental integrity. This film by Marc Scialom lived in a box until his daughter found it in 2005 and had it restored.
