Set during World War II in rural Vichy France, the film begins with a nine-year-old French boy, Claude  escaping from an orphanage, deciding not to stay confined under state protection for the rest of his childhood. He then comes across a Romani caravan, consisting of an extended family of 20 men, women and children, who decide to adopt this orphaned boy. The Romani start calling Claude, Korkoro, the free one. Claude too gets fascinated by their nomadic lifestyle and decides to stay with them.{{cite news}} Later, when Rosier has an accident outside the village, he is rescued by the Romanies, who treat the mayor with their traditional healing practices. Rosier returns the favour by selling them his father's house, in a move to protect them from the Fascist policy of imprisoning the homeless. Lundi decides to provide formal education for the children by enrolling them in her school. However, these friendly gestures are not well received by the freedom-loving Romanies, who regard life in a fixed place and formal education with rules as little better than imprisonment. Eventually when the Nazis arrive, Rosier and Lundi are revealed to be members of the French Resistance which leads to their arrest and torture. The Nazis round up the Romanies who are then sent to concentration camps. Claude, then cared for by Rosier chooses to go with the Romanies.<ref namehttp://www.indcatholicnews.com/news.php?viewStoryFilm: Korkoro |authorJuly 15, 2011 |workLondon |date=Feb 11, 2011 }}
