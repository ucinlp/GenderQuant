The film opens with a narrator introducing the ancient Greek Acropolis, describing its wealth and beautiful architecture . However, the narrator reveals that on the other end of the Acropolis, people were far lower-class and lived in poor conditions and housing . Tom is depicted as one of these inhabitants, an alley cat who lives in the shadows of Athens searching for food. He looks into a trash can sees a reflection of himself yet no food, then spots Jerry coming out from his hole to throw trash into his own, mouse-sized can. Peeking inside, Tom sees Jerry's well-furnished home and reaches in to grab him; when he over-stretches his arm around the marble pillars, it snaps back and smacks him in the face. Next Tom tries to enter the Acropolis and chase Jerry, only to be thrown out because cats are not allowed inside. After failing to hit Jerry with a catapult, he successfully sneaks in but has to keep hiding from the guards, accidentally knocking the arms off the Venus de Milo sculpture in the process . Jerry gets the better of him several more times, tricks him into jumping on a chariot, and unhooks the horses. Jerry returns to his home, runs to the trash can and takes out the trash again, and the cartoon ends with Tom careening down the front steps while running and screaming from the Acropolis with the narrator saying that the Greeks had a word for it; "HELP!"
