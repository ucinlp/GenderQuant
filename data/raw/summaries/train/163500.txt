 The day is May 8, 1938, the day when Hitler visited Rome to meet premier Mussolini. Also on this day, as her entire family  goes to the streets to follow the great meeting and the parade, an Italian housewife  stays home looking after some domestic tasks. Her apartment building is empty but for a man  who seems repulsed by fascism , living in the building across in the complex. As this chamber drama progresses, and loneliness of each is revealed, the audience learns that this man is a radio broadcaster who has lost his job and is about to be deported to Sardinia, due to his political attitudes and his homosexuality. Unaware of this, the housewife flirts with him, as they meet by chance in the empty building. During their conversation, the rather na√Øve and mainstream woman is surprised by his opinions and finally shocked when she realizes his sexual orientation. Nonetheless, despite their fights and arguments, a friendship develops and they eventually make love before he is taken away by the police and her family comes back home.Review - A Special Day Channel 4.A Special Day
