Asya  is a research assistant working in the history department of a university in İstanbul. Taking her 5-year-old daughter with her, Asya embarks on a journey back to her hometown with the dream of starting over again. There she gets a new job at a school. She starts working on a project that is about to change her entire life along with that of her students. While conducting research on old Ottoman court documents, Asya and her students come across an interesting incident. In the year 1917, a local mobster called Yengeç Salih killed a midwife called Nuriye, claiming that she was a prostitute. Charges were dropped against Salih when he told the court that he killed the woman for the sake of the neighborhood's reputation. The students, struck with the injustice in this case, decide to reenact the case and try Salih one more time.
