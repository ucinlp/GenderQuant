Harry Garmes  is an aging American career criminal who was once a driver for Chicago’s organized crime rings. He is living in self-imposed exile in Albufeira, a fishing village in southern Portugal, where he seeks occasional companionship from a local prostitute . Unexpectedly, Harry received a job, his first in nine years, to drive an escaped killer  and the man’s girlfriend  across Portugal and Spain into France. He accepts the job, despite premonitions that will end badly for him. In the course of the trip, Harry and his passengers are pursued by both the police and Harry’s former mobster cronies. Upon returning to Portugal, Harry gets shot on the beach in Albufeira, moments away from escaping.Shock Cinema, page 18, Edition No. 35, Summer 2008
