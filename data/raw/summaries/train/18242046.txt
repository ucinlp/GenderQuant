Book of Love is a mockumentary following the unrelated stories of three L.A. bachelors  as they recover from a series of unhealthy relationships. The team of average Joes are no match for their manipulative girlfriends , however, and the over eager men are taken for all they're worth. It's this manipulative, self-serving treatment that drives the young bachelors into behaving like "dogs" themselves. Written and directed by Jeffrey Byrd, Book of Love was produced by both BET Studios and 5th GearEntertainment, and eventually released by Strange Fruit Films.
