Tamala, bored with the city, leaves her human mother and boards a spaceship bound for her birthplace, Orion. Her ship is shot down by the Mysterious Postcat, and she lands in Hate City on the Planet Q. There she meets a male cat, Michelangelo, who becomes her boyfriend. While visiting a museum, Tamala discovers a mural detailing the sacrificial rituals of the ancient Minerva religion and the ruins of a statue of a female cat named Tatla. Later, the couple is pursued by Kentauros, a sadistic dog dressed as a motorcycle cop. He eats Tamala while Michelangelo watches from a tree. The film then changes tone, focusing for a while on a presentation given by Professor Nominos on the history of CATTY & Co.

He appears to die in the fire but returns, in an undead form, and approaches Michelangelo, telling him of Tamala's history. Tamala, meanwhile, meets with Tatla, and realizes that they are the reincarnation of Minerva. She returns to Hate City , and continues her voyage to Orion, accompanied by the mouse Penelope, a former sex slave for Kentauros.
