The beginning of the film contains some animations depicting Ibragim's acquisition from his native land and eventually we find him in the courts of Paris. He gets himself in trouble when a French countess, whom he had romances with, bears a black child. Ibragim is challenged to a duel which is played out humorously in a sped up timeframe. He leaves Paris shortly thereafter to return to his home in St. Petersburg where his godfather, and czar of Russia Peter the Great enthusiastically awaits his return. Upon arriving Ibragim expresses he is done with love, as his lover denounces him as a savage and his son is never fated to know his father. In an attempt to help Ibragim, as well as tie him into the nobility of Russia, Peter announces Ibragim and Natasha Rtishcheva are to be wed, to the despair of the family and the her current suitor. Ibragim however, refuses the marriage on the grounds that he believes Natasha is in love with another. This angers the czar who in turn begins to alienate both Ibragim and Natasha's family from his favor. The conundrum plays out in humorous and dramatic ways and eventually resolves in a pleasant and light-hearted manner.
