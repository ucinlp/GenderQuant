The story is about a French photographer Thomas Koré , who is searching for extraordinary experiences. Koré has become so detached from humanity that the only way he can connect with other people is to have—and photograph—bizarre and demeaning sexual encounters with prostitutes. When he meets on his path Fouad Saleh , a man with memory problems, he realized that Fouad is even more lost than he, and befriends him. The French man then tries to discover Fouad's history.
