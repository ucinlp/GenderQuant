At a party, they meet Adina , a sexy golddigger seeking a wealthy husband with robotic determination, and her shy law clerk friend Brandy . The couples pair off in predictable combinations, but while the brief encounter between Clyde and Adina quickly implodes when she discovers that Clyde's success is an act and his Porsche is borrowed, the relationship between Montel and Brandy blooms into a true romance. Eventually, they decide to move in together, motivating Clyde and Adina to reunite in a selfish scheme to break their best friends up using whatever treacherous means they can employ.
