Sid Carter  is the cunning head of a criminal gang that includes the longhaired drip Ernie Bragg , the cheeky Freddy  and Sid's son, Cyril . Cyril disguises himself as a new nurse in order to case a maternity hospital and the booty - the hospital's stock of contraceptive pills. The "Head Chopper" at the hospital, Sir Bernard Cutting , is convinced he's undergoing a sex change while the nutty Dr F.A. Goode ([[Charles Hawtrey  dishes out psychiatric mumbo jumbo. The hard working Matron  has more than enough to contend with on the wards, with the troublesome Mrs Tidey  who seems more interested in eating than producing a baby and her loyal, British Rail worker husband  who continually hangs around the waiting room. Waiting. Cyril is picked out by notorious "bird-watcher" Dr Prodd  and goes back to his place in order to get a map of the hospital. The poor doc gets a shock when the lovely "nurse" turns out to be a crook in a frock. However, "she" makes headline news when film star Jane Darling  hails "her" a heroine for helping her through her pregnancy. The Sister  desperately tries to keep the ward in order, while Cutting's secretary, Miss Banks  keeps her employer in check but nothing can cool his pent-up desire to prove himself as a man ... and it's Matron who's in his sights! The criminal gang don disguises - Sid dresses as the foreign Dr Zhivago and Ernie as a heavily expectant mum - but the crime is thwarted by the mothers-to-be. The medical hierarchy's threat to call the police is halted when Sid reveals the heroine of the day is a man. Cyril weds his shapely nurse, Susan Ball  and Matron finally gets her doctor.
