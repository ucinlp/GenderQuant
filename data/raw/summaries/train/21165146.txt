The titular character is a temperamental but lovable retired London barrister now living in the country with his granddaughter Virginia. Ernest Heron, Virginia's beau, returns from South Africa with a valuable diamond, and that night he is attacked and the gem is stolen. The only clue to the perpetrator's identity is a camellia Ernest is found clutching in his hand. Suspicion falls upon Chamberlin Jarvis, an acquaintance of Virginia who was a houseguest at the time, and Grumpy follows him when he returns to the city, where he tries to sell the diamond to Berci. Knowing Jarvis is a suspect, Berci turns him away, and the thief, frightened by a confrontation with Grumpy, eventually returns to the country, returns the jewel, and is arrested.
