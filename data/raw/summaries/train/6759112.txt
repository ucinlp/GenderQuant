Clayton Poole  is a small-town TV repairman whose former sweetheart, Carla Naples , is now a famous movie star. When Carla marries a Mexican bullfighter, who dies the day after the wedding, she becomes pregnant. Her agent, Harold Herman  tries to avoid a scandal and damage to her career by sending Carla back to the town she grew up in, telling the world that she is going into seclusion to prepare for her next role, the lead in a religious epic called "The White Virgin of the Nile." Carla turns to Clayton for help, and he agrees to care for the child once it is born. But Carla gives birth to triplets, and Clayton finds out that he has to be married before he can adopt them, so he marries Carla's younger sister, Sandy , who is in love with him. The press finds out about the triplets, and Carla tells them that she and Clayton are secretly married. Now suspected of bigamy, Clayton goes into hiding with the triplets until everything is cleared up. Nine months later, Sandy gives birth to quintuplets, and soon a statue of Clayton and his five babies is erected in front of the town courthouse.Adams, Les Plot summaryTCM Full synopsisBrennan, Sandra Plot synopsis
