Cabaret singer Olive Martin  approaches her former lover Peter Graham , just recently elevated to the Supreme Court, about the fact that he is the father of her out-of-wedlock son. To avoid exposing this scandal, Olive demands that Peter divorce his wife  and marry her. Meanwhile, the alleged son, Harold  is falling in love in Boston with Anita --who is Peter's daughter with his wife. News of their engagement and impeding marriage of incest requires Peter to divulge what he knows and forbid the marriage. In typical Abramson fashion, however, it is revealed that Olive has lied about Harold being her son--instead he is the son of Olive's brother-in-law merely being used by Olive for blackmail! Peter's plan to commit suicide is successfully stopped, and the wedding free to proceed.
