As a street painter paints out a white line in the middle of a road, Penelope is being chased by a dog and runs right under the paint tank and getting a white line across her spine whilst the dog crashes into the tank and painter. Pepe emerges from a fishing boat, scaring the boatman and sinking the boat. Pepe spies Penelope on a beach. He rushes and catches her with a few smooches while she wriggles her way out. As she scurries away, Pepe grabs and rides her tail until he slams into a post. After a bit of daydreaming, Pepe resumes his chase. Pepe pursues Penelope but slips on the sand and falls down a sea cliff into the sea. As Penelope reaches the rocks below, Pepe emerges embracing her and offering to get her a glass of water. When Pepe returns with the glass of water, he finds she has run off. Pepe finds, embraces and kisses Penelope on a boat but Penelope makes her escape in the sea with a diving mask and oxygen tank. Pepe follows her wearing a mask and flippers but no oxygen tank . A shark approaches and eats Pepe, but Pepe's stink makes the shark spit him out and flee on the beach. For a long time Penelope swims under the sea until sunset where she surfaces to find a nearby island. As she removes her diving gear, she finds Pepe waiting for her. As Pepe endlessly chases Penelope, the island is revealed to be heart-shaped from birdseye view.
