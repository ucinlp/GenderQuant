Joe Slovak  is a brilliant first-year med student whose nonconformist approach to life is tested when he enrolls in gross anatomy, the toughest course in med school. Joe's freewheeling, independent style creates funny moments in the classroom, but puts him at odds with his demanding professor , who questions whether her class "rebel" has what it takes to be a doctor. Meanwhile, Joe falls in love with his lab partner Laurie , who won't let anything, especially romance, interfere with her plans. And while Joe's never done anything by the book, he proves he does have what it takes to succeed &mdash; without changing his ways!
