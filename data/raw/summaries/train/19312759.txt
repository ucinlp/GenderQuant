The Gang competes in their version of the Olympics. As the boys try their hand at shot put, pole vault, and hurdles, Wheezer arrives and begins to teach Minnie how to do a Razzberry. They secretly razzle the Gang, and the gang keeps beating up an outsider who they accuse of the razzles. Farina tries the shot put, then later exhibits an exceptional pole vault. Joe has troubles with the pull up bar and a javelin. Peggy and Jean arrive to cheer on their hero, Joe. A rival gang appears and begins to pelt the kids with eggs and tomatoes. The Gang returns fire and hilarity results. They eventually catch Wheezer and Minnie razzing them; and they confront Wheezer. Wheezer sics Minnie on the Gang as they run away, Minnie on their heels.
