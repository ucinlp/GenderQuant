Jin-hee  is a 9-year-old girl whose father leaves her at an orphanage after remarrying. Before leaving her at the orphanage, her father buys her new clothes and a cake to convince her that she is going on a trip.  In the orphanage she tries to come to grips with the abandonment by her parents and insecurities about a possible adoption. She gradually makes friendships, although she retains the belief throughout most of the movie that her father will return to take her back, and struggles  not to adjust to her surroundings. In the end, Jin-hee is adopted by French parents who are eagerly waiting for her at an airport to meet their new child.
