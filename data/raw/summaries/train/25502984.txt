James W. Kelly, , and his pal Happy Moran, , are taking their all-girl-dancing troupe across the ocean to tour Europe, when Kelly and the mysterious Catherine Bell, , fall for each other, literally. When their backers pull out, Happy and Kelly manage to scrounge enough dough to get the girls back home; but, find themselves broke, in Europe, in a tiny country where the GDP is measured in mops. As a crooner, Kelly tries to sell enough mops, with a radio show, to pull the kingdom out of bankruptcy, and win Princess Tania, , the mysterious Catherine Bell, from their shipboard romance. Time is running out, as Prince Alexis, , invades, from the neighbouring country, to seize the castle and marry the Princess. Their only defence is the women and their “Personality Mops”, when the army quits, over back wages; and, Kelly is being marched off in front of a Firing Squad. “Make Love not War”, could be their slogan, as the women all march to the castle, singing and waving their mops.
