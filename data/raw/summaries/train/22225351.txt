Jack Lemmon plays a successful, physically exhausted, pill-popping American businessman, going through a divorce, who visits Naples, Italy. He spends several days there as a guest of a local business acquaintance, played by the elderly Marcello Mastroianni, who has a more laid-back philosophy and is devoted to his large family. In the process, Lemmon's character learns how to relax and live the good life.
