A legendary and friendly creature named Nessie lives happily in a small pond with her friend MacQuack, a rubber duck. When a rich developer takes the pond and land surrounding it to build a miniature golf course, Nessie is forced to search for a new home. She finds rejection everywhere and is always told to keep a stiff upper lip and not cry. Finally, Nessie loses all hope and starts crying for days, weeks, and months. When she can't cry anymore, she finds that her tears have created the Loch, a beautiful and perfect new home for her and MacQuack. During the five small credits we see the golf course has also been flooded, with the developer and his assistants using the sign as a raft. The developer breaks down into tears over his loss.
