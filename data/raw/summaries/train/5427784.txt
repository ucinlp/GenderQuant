Nancy, the 19-year-old daughter of Frank and Elaine Benson, wants to marry David, the 20-year-old son of Oliver Poe. What the bride doesn't know is that her parents are about to get a divorce. Poe, a music promoter, has a hunch something is amiss. He doesn't want the kids to get married, so before the wedding he exposes the Bensons' secret. Nancy and David decide marriage isn't necessary. They will live together instead, travel around the country with a rock band and heed the advice and wisdom of a Hindu mystic called The Baba Zeba. Frank and Elaine are seeing other people. He is involved with a divorcee, Lois Grey, while she is developing an interest in Phil Fletcher, who also is recently divorced. Poe, meanwhile, continues to see his mistress, LaVerne Baker. Then one day, Nancy finds out she is pregnant. The Baba Zeba persuades her to put up the baby for adoption. Frank and Elaine conspire behind their daughter's back to adopt their own grandchild. Complications arise, resulting in Frank trying to bribe the guru and even disguising himself as one of the Baba Zeba's robed followers. By the end, all ends well for everybody, the Bensons getting back together and Poe proposing to LaVerne.
