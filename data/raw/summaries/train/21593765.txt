Sudama Pandey  is a notorious criminal who runs a global operation of capturing women on camera. He operates out of London and is assisted by his 2 partners in crime . Be it a honeymoon bedroom, changing rooms, girls hostels, none of these places miss the third eye. The eye of a camera! First they capture girls on films and then abuse them, both physically and mentally. One such girl who gets trapped by them is Sapna . She is a lovely girl who had dreams in her eyes and wanted to make it big in her career. She was happy to have found love in her life through her fiancé. But her life was to be short-lived. She is murdered by Sudama's gang and a lovely personality came to an end. As luck would have it, the murder is witnessed by Ammu  who tries to rescue Sapna but her effort goes in vain. Ammu is terrorized by the events around her. But this was not an end to her ordeal as now she is being chased by Sapna's murderers. Meanwhile her sister Aarti  and her partner Rahul  too are in lookout for her as she has gone missing. Soon enters the scene Sapna'a fiancé Arjun Singh  who turns out to be none other than an A.C.P. in Mumbai. As a part of his assignment he had been on lookout for Sudama that leads him to London. And in London he has only one clue that could take him to his destination - Ammu! Unfortunately the clue herself is gone missing. He makes all possible attempts to find her but reaches a dead end. He can't find Ammu...and he doesn't have anyone else for help. He has to do everything all alone. The war is ON...and now the world would see the good win over evil. Because now Arjun just doesn't have to fight criminals...he also has to fight technology.
