A new science teacher  at Kona Pali High School in Hawaii pushes a group of students to come up with a science project. With a combination of design vision, mechanical skills, knowledge of batteries, and lightweight drivers, the students design and build a solar-powered car they name "Cockroach." Their team manages to outperform a corporate-sponsored car and win the local Big Island competition by correctly predicting cloudy weather based on the surfing experience of the student captain, Daniel . Cloudy weather would make their vehicle's battery capacity a more important factor than its weight. With the shop teacher as chaperone , the students travel to Australia to compete in the World Solar Challenge. To the relief of their corporate sponsor , who is still bitter over the loss of his company-built vehicle in Hawaii, their car is delayed at the very start of the race. However, the students choose to persevere and remain in the race. A sand storm and other difficulties provide occasions for heroism. Uni  pilots the car through difficult terrain, but has an accident and is rescued by Gilbert . After Cindy  is disqualified from driving for drinking alcohol, Eduardo  puts aside his "lolo-haole" conflict with Daniel and reduces the car to allow the overweight Gilbert to drive.
