The movie chronicles the 1951 cheating scandal at West Point and its impact on Army's football team, which was forced to cut loose virtually its entire squad. Going into the 1950 Army–Navy Game, the Cadets football team was heavily favored, yet went on to lose to a weak Midshipmen squad, 14-2. The Academy and football team were then thrown into a scandal when 90 cadets, including 37 lettering football players, were dismissed in a cheating scandal which broke the Academy’s Honor Code.
