Sach is hired to take care of Gloria, a poodle, on an overseas trip to London, England. Unbeknownst to Sach, the people who hired him are actually diamond smugglers, who have hidden some diamonds under some false fur on Gloria. The rest of The Bowery Boys are jealous of Sach's job, and the large amount of money he receives as a result. The boys also believe that Sach is actually taking care of a pretty female. They decide to sneak onto the ship Sach is boarding for London, only to wind up swabbing the deck as punishment for being stowaways. Once in England, Sach and the boys soon catch on to the smugglers' scheme. Unfortunately, Inspector Herbert Saunders, one of the smartest detectives of Scotland Yards accuses the Boys of being the smugglers.
