In 1958, Fran√ßoise Sagan is 23 years old. Her first couple of novels have made her rich and famous. She lives an easy life, filled with sex and debauchery, surrounded by her group of friends. On the 8th of August that year, at the Casino in Deauville, she gambles her last chips on the number 8 and wins 8 million francs, with which, a couple of hours later, she buys the house which she rented, in nearby Honfleur. This makes her the owner of that property, and she vows that she will never leave the place. Why is she, 40 years later, living there all alone, as a recluse? What events made a young promising novelist end up all alone, without the ones she loved, and used, all those years?
