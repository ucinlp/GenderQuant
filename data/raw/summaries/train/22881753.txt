A man traveling to the funeral of his fifth-grade teacher recalls his life at the time. As a city boy transferred to a country school, he encountered an unexpectedly old-fashioned hierarchical bullying system. When he tried to create a rebellion against the system, both those oppressed by it and the teachers and parents opposed him. When change finally came to the school, it was in an equally harsh form.Synopsis based on {{Amg movie}}
