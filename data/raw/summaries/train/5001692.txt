Laxman is an intelligent student who is prevented from doing well in school by his mischievous band of friends Gopal, Madhav, and mute Lucky. The three friends use Laxman's hostel room to conduct their mischievous activities. Laxman is peer-pressured into running a series of scams to earn himself and his friends some money and is punished by being thrown out of college. The naughty foursome then finds refuge in the bungalow of a blind couple by pretending to be their grandson. A cat-and-mouse game unfolds as Laxman’s body and Gopal’s voice makes for Sameer &mdash; the grandson from the U.S. Each time the blind Dadaji comes amidst them, hilarious situations arise. Enter Nirali, as the saucy girl-next-door, with a bath towel and the group now have time, place and ‘resources’ to fall in love. Their individual efforts at winning the lady’s heart fail. Apart from their amorous interests, there is a quest for hidden treasure in the old couple’s house. There is also a gangster named Babli who wants to steal from the old couple's bungalow. All his attempts are unintentionally and unknowingly thwarted by the foursome. At last it is revealed that Sameer and his parents were killed in a car accident in the U.S. a long time ago. The grandfather performed their final rites but didn't tell the grandmother. He has no objection to the four boys staying with them, but the grandmother secretly hears all this. At the same time, Babli arrives at the scene with his gang and it is revealed that he had sneaked some diamonds into the urn containing the last rites of the dead people some years ago. This urn was at the present in the treasure chest. A comical fight ensues between the foursome and Babli's gang. After everything is over, Lucky wins Nirali's heart.
