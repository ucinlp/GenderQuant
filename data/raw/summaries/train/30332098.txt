The U.S. government initiates a program to create genetically modified cybernetic super soldiers, but it goes awry when the test subjects escape from their holding cells. Set on an island in an undisclosed location. A team of Marine grunts is stalked by the genetically and physically superior experimental Universal Soldiers. The Universal Soldier characters, sometimes called ""UNISOL's"" an acronym also used in the completely unrelated Universal Soldier series of films, are restricted and monitored by computerized metal masks that cover the left side of their faces. To act independently, the soldiers must rip the mask off, mutilating their faces. Most wear black jumpsuits with armor on their chests, shoulders and spines and display superhuman abilities. They can move fast enough to not be seen and jump so high and far that they appear to be flying, though they are not capable of true flight. The Marine's try to survive the attacks by the Unisols, as well as each other's conflicting personalities and strategies. Much of the story centers around some characters who try to find an armory and establish a defense while the more scientifically minded characters instead try to find the bunker where their enemy is coming from. The total nature of the Universal Soldiers is never clearly explained and each is apparently slightly more advanced then the previous. At least two of them appear to be reanimated corpses or at least share a resemblance with modern "living dead" character's seen in horror genre movies. They have pasty bluish skin that seems wrinkled and possibly brittle. At least some of them may have a robotic metal endo-skeleton though this only suggested by the appearance of the final, most advanced "Unit", which is a 25 foot tall robotic skeleton. It is apparently incomplete and may be intended to have the same cover of human flesh that the smaller soldiers have since its unprotected metal structure is vulnerable to missile attack and electricity.
