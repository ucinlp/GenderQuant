The film is loosely based on the classical Indian folktale of the hare and the tortoise, providing a modern interpretation of the same. Even though the good  may win in the end, is it worth the wait? The tortoise &mdash; Rajaram P. Joshi  &mdash; is a middle-class clerk living in a chawl  in Bombay. He is secretly in love with his neighbor, Sandhya Sabnis  but is unable to disclose his love for her, mainly due to his timidity. Rajaram is a very goodnatured and hardworking man. Most of his neighbors and colleagues take advantage of his goodness. One day Rajaram's fast-tallking friend Bashudev  &mdash; the hare &mdash; comes for a visit and makes himself at home. Bashudev generally impresses people by his false success stories and his over-the-top attitude. Bashudev starts wooing Sandhya, and she falls in love with him. He then joins Rajaram's company, Footprint Shoes, by impressing the owner, Mr. Dhindhoria, with false stories about his work experience and love of golf. He also starts flirting with Dhindhoria's beautiful wife Anuradha  and daughter Jojo  at the same time. In the chawl, the Sabnis family decides to get Sandhya married to Bashudev, much to the misery of Rajaram. But on the day of the engagement, Bashudev disappears after being caught red-handed, romancing Anuradha, by Jojo. The engagement is called off. Rajaram then offers to marry the devastated Sandhya, but she tells him that she has been very intimate with Bashudev and is perhaps pregnant. Rajaram shows his greatness by accepting her in spite of all this and expressing his long hidden love towards her. According to vile parle based film expert Rajesh Subramanian Sai Paranjpye was very annoyed with producer Basu Bhattacharya when the release of Sparsh got delayed. 3 years later when Sai Paranjpye made Katha, she purposely named Farooque Shaikh's character, which had negative shades, Basu Bhatt.
