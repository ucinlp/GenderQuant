Prabhu , the chairman of Chennai's Government Arts College, is asked by his Principal to invite the Governor of Tamil Nadu, Kakarla Sathyanaryanamoorthy , to be the chief guest on the annual day of the college. When he goes to invite Kakarla, he bumps into his daughter, Shruthi , and instantly falls in love with her. To propose his love for her, he even joins in the same dance class as her. She too subsequently gets to know more about him, and falls in love with him. Since there is considerable fear of terrorism in the state, Kakarla does not permit his daughter to travel anywhere without bodyguards. On one occasion, she manages to give them the slip and runs away with Prabhu at a dance festival. Shortly after there is the threat of a bomb being planted. Shruthi is immediately brought home, and Prabhu is arrested. Shruthi is forbidden to see Prabhu. After being beaten severely, Prabhu is released from police custody. He then goes to meet Shruthi, unaware of the changed circumstances. This is where he finds evidence that will lead him to a hideout of terrorist Mallikarjuna  who is the mastermind of bomb blasts, and joins forces with Kakarla for killing innocent civilians. Whether Prabhu will become a victim or emerge a victor forms the rest of the story.
