J.R. is a typical Italian-American young man on the streets of New York. When he gets involved with a local girl, he decides he wants to get married and settle down, but when he learns that she was once raped, he cannot handle it. More explicitly linked with Catholic guilt than Scorsese's later work, we see what happens to J.R. when his religious guilt catches up with him.
