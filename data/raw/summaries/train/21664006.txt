The film is set in Nazi Germany in 1942. An Aryan family, the Meissners, and a Jewish family, the Silbersteins, are neighbors and friends. The respective sons in each family, Heinrich Meissner and David Silberstein, discreetly take piano lessons together. The deportation of the Silbersteins to a concentration camp is imminent, and when Heinrich asks why they may have to go soon, Frau Meissner does not tell Heinrich the truth. She instead invents a story that the Silbersteins will go to a new place called "Toyland". Heinrich says that when the Silbersteins go, he wants to go with them, so that he can still be with his friend David, which terrifies Frau Meissner. After the Silbersteins are taken away for deportation, Heinrich is found missing from his room one morning. Marianne Meissner begins to search for Heinrich. She encounters ridicule from Gestapo officers after she explains her situation, because they think that she is Jewish. However, after she shows her papers that prove that she is Aryan, they accept her story about Heinrich and assist in searching for him. The search continues until the last moment before the train with the Silbersteins on it must leave.
