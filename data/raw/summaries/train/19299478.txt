The gang decides to be pirates and build a boat, which sinks immediately upon launching. The boys blame Mary because she is a girl. Friendly sea captain, Capt. Whelan, tells her she can play pirate on his fishing boat and the boys join her. Their boat accidentally gets set free of her moorings and the gang has adventures on the “high seas” of the harbor, until they are boarded by the U.S. Navy.
