Oswald goes to a dental clinic for treatment to his cavity problem. While the dentist tries to pull out his damaged tooth, news broke out of a radio in the shop, reporting that the king is in serious depression and needs to be cheered up. In this, Oswald abandons his dental treatment, and heads outside to spread the word. In his castle, the king is having a long face for some reason. His personal jester tries to brighten him up but to no avail, and therefore leaves the throne room. Oswald then shows up and reads to him a book of comical rhymes. The rabbit's attempt helped a little and the king's mood improves slightly. Other entertainers also come in for a similar cause. Each of them has a distinctive method in providing comedy. It all came down when some of them employed an act that involves hurling pies at each other. Eventually, everyone in the room joined the foodfight, and so did the king who started to enjoy it. Momentarilly, the jester returns to the throne room to see what was happening. Upon noticing the king back in good spirits, the jester grew envious, and decides to take his grudge on one of the entertainers. The jester captures Oswald and brings the rabbit into a torture chamber at a basement of the castle. He then puts a noose around Oswald's neck, with other end of the rope being pulled by three elephants. Oswald finds this ordeal impossible to get out of. It appears the experience at the castle was nothing more than a nightmare as Oswald wakes up and sees himself still at the dental clinic. The dentist, at last, succeeds in extracting the tooth, and Oswald was relieved of his dental worries.
