In the year 2068 the Earth is plagued by typhoons, tsunamis, droughts, and floods. Against this apocalyptic background an Argentine scientist, Carlos Nahuel Goldstein, outlines a theory: knowing that the axis of rotation of our planet is inclined due to the gravitational force exerted by the Moon, if men were able to destroy it, the Earth would be straightened and then climate would become stabilized. While the international community rejects that reasoning, the Argentine government, without consulting the other nations, decides to send a secret mission to bomb the Moon. The project is called "Good bye, dear Moon." When the great powers find out, they threaten to apply severe economic sanctions to Argentina, forcing it to abort the mission. The crew of the Estanislao ship are left on their own, flying without control or ground support towards the Moon. The crew is made up of three Argentine astronauts: the commander , the subcommanders Esteban Ulloa  and Silvia Rodulfo . Facing an uncertain destiny, the passions among the crew build up. An extraterrestrial presence watches them and ejects the commander into space. When they are alone, Rodulfo confesses his love to Ulloa. His love made him become astronaut, so he could be near her. Affected by the confession, Ulloa gives herself to him. Unexpectedly, the extraterrestrial bursts into the ship to declare its love to Rudolfo.
