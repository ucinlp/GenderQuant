Picking up where Leningrad Cowboys Go America left off, the band has settled in Mexico after charting a top ten hit there. However, many band members become alcoholics spending most of their day drinking tequila. Before long, more than half of the band members have died from excessive drinking. The surviving members have, in the mean time, become naturalized Mexicans. Down on their luck, the band is contacted by their manager Vladimir  who, after going through an experience of being born again, now calls himself Moses. Moses has secured a gig for the band at Coney Island. They must now cross the Mexicoâ€“United States border illegally as a CIA agent  is on their tail. Afterwards, Moses helps the remaining members return to the Promised Land  so that they can rebuild the band.
