Dr. Peter Bach, a young and excellent teacher, has been mistakenly diverted to the village of Tuttelbach, where he teaches at the local elementary school. When the head of the Education Ministry, von Schnorr, attempts to correct that mistake, he finds Dr. Bach unwilling to leave since he has come to enjoy the easy and picturesque village life. However, in the end Bach is left with no other choice when von Schnorr accidentally drops his burning cigar into the school room's waste basket, where it quickly starts a fire that burns the school to the ground. Dr. Bach  and his nephew Jan  move to Baden-Baden, where Bach is assigned to the notorious Class 12a of the Mommsen-Gymnasium. Pepe Nietnagel  and his classmates are not looking forward to meet their new teacher, but Dr. Bach's easy-going and frank personality soon gains their genuine sympathy and support. Oberstudiendirektor Dr. Taft  as the old-fashioned traditionalist he is, however, just as quickly disapproves of Dr. Bach's approach to the students, and together with the majority teaching staff's majority  decide to get rid of him as quickly as possible. When Pepe and his friends learn about this, they begin to fight tooth and nail to keep Dr. Bach at their school, culminating in a school play in which Dr. Bach and the students present a very liberal re-interpretation of Schiller's William Tell.
