Thiru  and Surya  are inseparable friends. They are so close to each other that Thiru selects a bride for Surya and Surya for Thiru. Their friendship is carried over from their grandfathers and fathers who were thick friends. Thiru brings up Surya's daughter, because Thiru has no children. Shankara  wants to separate them and does all that he could to separate them. Surya's sister becomes pregnant due to a love affair with Thiru's relative. On the eve of her wedding, Divya ([[Devayani , Thiru's wife, helps her run away with the guy she loves. This breaks the friendship between the two as Surya's mother  poisons his ears against Thiru.
