When Mr Pedelty  leaves his firm, he is given a television set as a retirement present. At first he enjoys all the attention from his neighbours, but soon the attraction wears off, and he sells it on to a young married couple  living in the flat above him. They soon encounter the same problems, and again the set is passed on to several different characters all with the same results.
