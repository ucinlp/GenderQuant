The film begins with three aliens, one blue, one red, and one yellow, traveling to Earth in a flying saucer. While watching a holographic music video of a multi-coloured female of their species, they enter Earth's atmosphere somewhere over California. Valerie Gail  is a valley girl manicurist who works for the "Curl Up & Dye" hair salon. When she feels her cold fiancé Dr. Ted Gallagher  is slipping away, she attempts to seduce him with a new look; instead she catches him cheating on her with his nurse. She kicks him out and refuses to see him until the wedding. The next day, she is sunbathing when the aliens' spaceship crash lands in her pool. Wanting them to blend in to their surroundings, she takes them to her friend Candy Pink . After shaving off the aliens' fur, they turn out to be attractive men. They all go out and party at Los Angeles nightclubs. The three aliens — red Wiploc , yellow Zeebo  and blue Mac — absorb human  culture through ten minutes of television, and Valerie takes them on a tour of human culture. Valerie and Mac discover that they are much better off together and she leaves with them once the ship has been repaired.
