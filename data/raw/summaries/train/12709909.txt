Maya  is an up and coming college student who is date raped by a sociopath who utters racist slurs in her ear as he brutally, sadistically rapes her. She disconnects herself from familiar surroundings. Struggling to break free of the resulting depression and addiction, as well as the hum-drum existence of folding shirts at the local boutique, Maya seeks out the help of a DJ she meets, named Adrian  at a dance club. The two lure the rapist  to Maya's place, and exact revenge. At the end of the film Maya seems to realize that her vengeance although satisfying will not restore her to the confident self-assured woman she was before.
