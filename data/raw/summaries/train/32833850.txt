Nakaura of Julian, a priest of the Society of Jesus, was one of four young ambassadors sent to Rome by the Jesuits in 1538, as proof that Japan had converted to Christianity. Fifty years after this glorious mission, which so fascinated European royalty, Julian was forced again to prove his faith, only this time before a Shogun, who wanted to force him to abandon his religion. Julian resists, as does Miguel Chijiwa, a fellow at the embassy to Rome, who become a martyr. Betrayed by Christopher Ferreira, who can not stand the pain of torture, Julian suffers an inglorious death ... or maybe not.Os Olhos da √Åsia Cinema. Retrieved on 22 August 2011
