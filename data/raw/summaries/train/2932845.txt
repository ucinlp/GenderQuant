{{Plot|date"The Library""The Drowned""The Library""The Cold""The Library""Whispers""The Library" * Final Segment With the conclusion of the third tale, Lovecraft is confronted by the head monk, who assures him that all will be fine if he opens the door. Lovecraft admits he dropped the key. Furious, the monk warns Lovecraft to replace the book, but the author is attacked by a monster in the water beneath him, and the last of the seals opens up. The head monk reveals himself to not be human at all, as he begins stretching his body through the bars to enter the room, and Lovecraft uses a sword in his cane to defeat the monster in the water. The monk mocks Lovecraft, telling him the secrets of the Necronomicon do not come cheaply, and it will cost your life. Lovecraft is forced to use his sword once more to wound and stun the monk, who is then devoured by a nameless being who comes through the dimensional barrier, which is then sealed once more by the seals as the vault closes. Gathering his things and grabbing the book, Lovecraft begins to depart, being caught by one of the monks who warns him of the foolishness of his actions, telling him he will pay for his misdeeds. Lovecraft then escapes to the taxi and orders it to leave, and it leaves unpursued.
