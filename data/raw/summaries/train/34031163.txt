A rat is sitting on a rock at a park, wondering how he should spend his day. He then sees a charming girl hippo in his surrounding, and therefore develops affection for her despite the size difference. Although a boy elephant was first to come and court her, the rat finds this a minor problem and thinks of a way to break them. Just then, Krazy Kat comes to the area. Wanting to befriend the rat, Krazy plays a song in his banjo. The rat, however, appears to be uninterested, and grabs Krazy's instrument before knocking down the cat with it. The rat then approaches the girl hippo and tries to serenade her with the banjo. Because the boy elephant has a phobia of rodents, the rat easily drives out the pachyderm who runs away in panic. After fleeing the park, the boy elephant finds himself just outside a tavern. He then notices a barrel of beevo right next to him. The elephant then drinks the contents of the barrel and somehow gets the courage to get back at the rat. Back at the park, the rat and the girl hippo are still around dating each other. In no time, the encouraged boy elephant returns to settle the score. After jumping on and smashing the rat to death, the boy elephant regains the girl hippo. Before the two hefty lovers happily walked away, the boy elephant covers the rat's corpse in dirt and lays a flower pot just beside. Krazy shows up again to see what become of his would-be-friend. Saddened by this, he plays a solemn tune in his banjo, and his tears showered upon the flower pot. Seconds later, a flower grows from the pot and the rat's ghost appears on it. Annoyed by Krazy's gesture, the ghostly rat strucks the feline off his feet with a cinderblock before ascending to the great beyond.
