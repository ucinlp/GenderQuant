Chedworth lends money to Arthur to cover his gambling debts, but is fired from his job after years of service. He is gven a compensatory employment as a night watchman, and stumbles upon some money hidden by gangsters. Chedworth uses the money to improve his situation. He winds a fortune from an accidental racing bet and from some apparently worthless gold mining shares sold to him by some crooks. Chedworth moves into a large house, unaware the money he discovered was counterfeit. The gangsters come after the money and kidnap Chedworth. They are arrested by a police officer who has been romancing Gwen, and Chedworth gets to keep his legitimate fortune. Susie wins a singing competition.
