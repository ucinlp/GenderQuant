Just as Genji Takiya  is about to take over Suzuran All Boys High School as its leader of the newly formed G.P.S. alliance, he unwittingly breaks a pact by protecting Sho Kawanishi  from a violent confrontation with students of rival school Hosen Academy, who're famed for being so violent that they're known as the Army of Killers. Genji quickly learns that the pact between Suzuran and Hosen was made two years earlier after Sho Kawanishi broke a gang law by using a weapon that fatally stabbed Hosen's leader. Suzuran had sworn to a pact they would not interfere with Hosen's actions when Kawanishi is released from prison. Genji's accidental protection of Kawanishi prompts the new Hosen leader, Taiga Narumi , to declare war against Suzuran, forcing Genji and his allies to go on defensive, which ultimately sparks violent confrontations between Suzuran and Hosen.
