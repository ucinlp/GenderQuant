A jaded pilot named Noah Dugan  is unemployed and owes a large amount of money due to his gambling. He goes to an old friend named Stoney  who owns an airfield. He is offered a job flying a cargo of animals to a remote South Pacific island aboard a B-29 bomber. Bernadette Lafleur  is the prim missionary who accompanies him. Bernadette has raised the animals at an orphanage and is close to two of the orphans Bobby and Julie . The two children cannot bear to part with their beloved animals and stow away aboard the bomber as it takes off. During the flight, the plane goes off course and Dugan is forced to crash land on an uncharted island. While on the island, the group meets two elderly Japanese holdout soldiers who have lived there alone for 35 years. At first they treat them as enemies as they are unaware that World War II is over. However, Bernadette wins their friendship and trust and they propose to turn the plane into a boat to sail back to civilization. In the meantime Noah and Bernadette  fall in love. The two had resented each other at first. Bernie even paints the logo "Noah's Ark" on the converted boat-plane. The animals are also brought on board at Bobby's urging. Bobby resents Dugan at first, but the two eventually develop a close bond, especially after Dugan saves Bobby's life when the boy falls overboard while fishing for sharks. In the end, the characters are rescued by a United States Coast Guard cutter. The ending of the film shows Noah and Bernadette being married and then embracing the orphans as their own children.
