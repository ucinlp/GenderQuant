Jack  is a mouse who lives with his valet Rochester ([[Eddie Anderson  inside the walls of the house of famous radio and television star Jack Benny. Before his mouse girlfriend Mary  arrives to celebrate her birthday, Jack has to count the cheese in his vault. When he gets a flyer inviting entertainers to the "Kit Kat Club" for free, Jack and Mary head there in Jack's rattletrap car, but the "club" turns out to be the open mouth of a very hungry cat. As Jack scratchily plays "Tea for Two" on his violin, the cat's mouth closes and the screen goes black. The real-life Jack Benny wakes up, musing about the crazy dream he had, only to hear "Rock-a-bye Baby" played on a violin coming from inside his own cat. He then sees two animated mice &ndash; Jack and Mary &ndash; climbing out of the cat's mouth.
