In a case of mistaken identity, a naive young columnist for the Daily Beast is sent to cover a war in Ishmaelia. A confused editor, Mr. Salter  acting on the orders of his much feared 'boss', Lord Copper  tells William Boot  to cover the ongoing war as the correspondent for 'The Daily Beast'. Boot normally writes about British country life, but he's too timid, and worried about losing his job for good, to say otherwise when he's ordered overseas. Boot is soon up to his neck in intrigue. All the foreign journalists are confined to the capital of Ishmaelia, and they are not allowed to leave unless permission has been given by the Minister of Propaganda. The journalists all stick together, drinking and trying to pass time, but they watch each other jealously for signs that someone may have a story to send home. However, Lord Hitchcock, the correspondent for the Daily Brute is noticeably absent, and this sends the reporters on an insane quest into the desert in the hope of finding the sought after 'Scoop' The story is full of bizarre characters; an insane Swedish diplomat who goes berserk when he drinks too much Absinthe, the mysterious Mr. Baldwin , and a German woman who claims she somehow or another lost her husband. The hapless William Boot appears to be completely out of his depth in the middle of all this chaos and confusion.
