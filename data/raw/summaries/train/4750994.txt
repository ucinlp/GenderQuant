Saaransh is a story of an old Maharashtrian couple living in Shivaji Park, Mumbai, coming to terms with the death of their only son who is killed in a mugging incident in New York. Devastated to learn that their child has been killed, former headmaster B.V. Pradhan and his wife, Parvati, grieve. With their son dead, there is no income coming in, so they rent out a room in their Shivaji Park  apartment to a budding Bollywood actress, Sujata Suman, who has been having an illicit affair with Vilas , the only son of a politician named Gajanan Chitre. Vilas lacks the guts to tell his father that he is in love and would like to marry Sujata and puts off any marriage plans. They get intimate and, as a result, Sujata gets pregnant. When Pradhan finds out, he offers to take Sujata to meet Gajanan with the hope that he will permit her to become his daughter-in-law. Gajanan not only refuses, he also threatens them: He warns them of dire consequences if Sujata does not abort the child and moves away to another town. Pradhan refuses to let Sujata out of his house, and then begins the stalking and harassment by Gajanen's men. Pradhan goes to file a police complaint but is told that the police cannot even touch Gajanan's men. Sujata has no choice but to continue to seek shelter with Pradhan and Parvati. Sujata does not know that they have a secret agenda of their own in keeping her within their sight One poignant moment is when Pradhan  is haggling with the customs officials to recover his son's ashes.
