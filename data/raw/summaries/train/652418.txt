Television journalist Diana  manages to record footage of a cocaine deal gone wrong, between the Italian mob and a street gang known as the Demons. The footage shows mob boss Giancarlo ([[Richard Norton  killing the Demon's leader. Diana's partner is captured and she bumps into TV chef Jackie , who helps her escape from the gangsters. Diana later accidentally switches the videotape of the drug trade with one of Jackie's cooking videos from a box of tapes. The mob, knowing that the tape is still out there, tracks Diana down to her home to force her to give them the tape. Diana's tape ends up in the hands of Jackie's friend Richard, an officer for the city's police department, and his family. When Richard discovers the tape, he and his department launch their own investigation in the mob and gang case. The gangsters search for Jackie but are unable to capture him, so they destroy his home and kidnap his girlfriend Miki . Unauthorized to participate in the kidnapping case, Jackie is told not to interfere by the police and would be arrested if he did so, but does not listen. Jackie is later captured, taken to Giancarlo, and forced into an unfair fight whereby Jackie's arms and legs are restrained with ropes held by the henchmen. After taking a serious beating, Giancarlo orders his men to kill Jackie at a construction site outside his home. Jackie escapes and destroys Giancarlo's home by driving through it in a 120-ton mining vehicle from the nearby construction site. The authorities arrive, including Richard, but the police decided to state that they did not witness anything and that it was all just a gang battle, so Jackie goes free while the mobsters are arrested for possession of cocaine.
