Jeevudu, an untouchable cobbler, leads a saintly life with his wife Seva and son Bhavudu. Because of his devotion, Lord Vishnu appears before him every day, and eats whatever he is given as a prasad offering. Santha, the daughter of the proud and powerful Rajaguru, learning of this, visits his hut to discover whether it is true. When she witnesses it for herself, she informs her father of this wonder. Angry that his daughter has visited the house of an untouchable, he locks her up. He then informs Jeevudu that the king's mother was performing a cheppula nomu  and needs a thousand sandals by next morning. Jeevudu and his family work all night, but can only make a few sandals. They fall asleep from exhaustion; when they awaken the next morning, they find the house full of sandals. Rajaguru lies to the king, persuading him to order Jeevudu to be imprisoned and to have his hands cut off and his eyes put out; Bhavudu is stoned. With the help of a flower girl, Santha escapes from the chamber where her father has confined her. She tells Seva what has happened to her husband and her son. When Seva goes to the jail and sees her blinded husband, she puts her own eyes out. At this point, Lord Vishnu and his consort Sridevi appear in the form of tribals. They restore their devotees; Rajaguru realizes the error of his ways; and all ends happily.
