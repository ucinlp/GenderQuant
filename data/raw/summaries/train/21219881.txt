The film centres on Michael Archer , a forensic anthropologist who inadvertently discovers a set of subtle clues within the works of Leonardo da Vinci, that, when interpreted correctly, will lead the finder to "enlightenment". Archer, convinced of the authenticity of the clues, sets out to locate the treasure by travelling around the world, following each clue in turn. As time passes, however, Archer soon realizes that he is not alone in the quest for the treasure, and that he must combat other more determined treasure-seekers who would sooner see him dead.
