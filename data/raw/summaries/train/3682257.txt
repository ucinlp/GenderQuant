After a Boeing 747-100 takes off from New York City to London, a mysterious note turns up at the airport stating that passengers aboard the flight will be killed before the Boeing 747-100 lands at Heathrow. This creates a twist on the classic whodunit suspense format that may be described as "Who's going to do it to whom?" &mdash; as all of the quirky passengers seem like potential culprits and/or victims. At first the note is brushed off as a prank, but the plot thickens considerably once passengers do begin turning up murdered.
