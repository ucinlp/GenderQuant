Salud  and Plata  eke out a living as bush pilots in South America. They fake plane crashes in order to collect the insurance money, but one time the plane crashes for real in the middle of the jungle. There they find a diamond mining community operated by Mr. Ears . Plata and Salud decide to make a living by competing against Mr. Ears, making delivery services by airplane. Salud meets with an old man  in the village, where he takes him to see a mountain and tells him the story of three friends who killed themselves, and why. The story involves the mystery behind the old man's story, and various slapstick fights with Mr. Ears, who dislikes the competition. The film though in true vein of most of the famous duo's movies has some quite memorable moments for being poignant as seen in the scenes where each Plata and Salud had thought the other was dead and also When Cyril had died. Another quite liberated and moving scene wherein Plata asks the local Lady cook to dance with him to demonstrate to Salud where they were, a beautiful song and dance ensued followed by Plata saying to Salud "now do you know where we are?" Some very typically Italian directed movie moments we saw too little from of these two great actors.
