Working class Ellen  makes friends with her young son’s middle-class schoolteacher, Miss Thompson , and their growing lesbian relationship is tastefully explored as Ellen’s marriage to the clumsy factory worker, Hardy ([[Andrew Dunn , gradually falls apart. In the end Ellen finds the strength to follow her true path and her marriage is pretty much over. Because of the stifling social attitudes of the 1950s she and Hardy seem like they’ll pretend to still be together. The film closes on a happy note as Ellen catches a train away from the factory town where she lives, to spend time with Kathy.
