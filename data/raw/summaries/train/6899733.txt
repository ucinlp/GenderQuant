The film follows the courtship and marriage of Catherine Falconetti  to local butcher Joseph Santangelo , as well as Catherine's relationship with her overbearing Old World mother-in-law . The film also focuses on Catherine and Joseph's daughter Teresa , a devout Catholic more similar to her superstitious grandmother than with her modernized and secularized parents. As a child and young adult she puts herself through a series of trials so that she might one day be canonized as a saint. Teresa's teenage fantasy to become a nun is strained after starting a relationship with a marriage-minded young man . The film explores both family dynamics over the course of time as well as, on a larger level, the relationship between religious faith in miracles and modernity.
