Former ballplayer 'Coop'  is working as a peanut vendor at the ballpark of a struggling major league club, the Bisons. He has passed on his love of the game to his son Christie , but after sneaking his son into the game one too many times, he is fired from his job. Christie ingratiates himself with the former owner's niece  and gets his father's job back as well as a position as batboy for himself. As a publicity stunt, Christie is named their youngest manager ever, but when he falls ill, Coop replaces him as manger. The Bisons win the pennant and earn a spot in the World Series.
