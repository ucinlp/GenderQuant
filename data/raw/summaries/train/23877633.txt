Tonia  is a cabaret singer in post-World War II Poland towards the end of the life of Russian leader Joseph Stalin. She is arrested, without being told why, and placed in a political prison to be interrogated. Over a course of several years, she is humiliated and tortured by prison officials into confessing to other crimes she did not commit. After failing to sign a document detailing a false confession, she is taken to the prison shower block and locked into a small cage between the floor. The water is turned on and the room is slowly flooded. She is released at the last moment, and forced to sign the confession form again, which she continues to refuse to do so. Whilst in prison, she demands that she sees her husband. One day he visits the prison, and is told of her alleged one-night stand prior to her arrest, and he tells her that he doesn't want to see her again. She unsuccessfully attempts suicide. She develops a romantic relationship with one of the prison officials, becomes pregnant by him, and is forced to give up her child for adoption, before eventually being released.
