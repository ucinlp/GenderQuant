Errol Flynn stars as Dr. Newell Paige, a surgeon whose refusal to name the real culprit in a fatal operation awry results in the ruin of his career. Dismissed from the hospital staff, Paige leaves Massachusetts and travels to Oregon to assist a researcher in Rocky Mountain spotted fever, almost dying when he subjects himself to an experimental serum. Anita Louise stars as Phyllis Dexter, his eventual love interest, and Cedric Hardwicke as Dean Harcourt, an Anglican clergyman and radio preacher whose advice Dr. Paige at first dismisses, then later realizes is the truth. The film ends with Paige, returned to his former post and cleared of all charges, and Phyllis seated in the cathedral, listening to Dean Harcourt quoting a Psalm, followed by the St. Luke choristers' amen.
