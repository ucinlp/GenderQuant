A Scottie dog Sandy is starving. He asks his friend, Rover what he's doing in a car. Rover tells him how he got a master. In a flashback Rover goes up to Porky's apartment room while he's taking a bath. He puts on a towel and answers it. Rover walks in and says proposes to be Porky's pet. Porky does not want him and kicks him out. Rover bangs on the door and Porky gets it. Porky is not impressed with Rover's talents, carries him out of his apartment and drops him off the stair banister. He runs back to his room panting along with Rover near him. Then Rover flicks Porky's snout and dresses up like Carmen Miranda and sings Mi Caballero, by M.K. Jerome and Jack Scholl. Porky just throws him out. Rover walks back in yelling Porky doesn't want him. He becomes sorrowful and walks over to the window. He pretends to jump to end his life. Porky runs over, but he sees Rover lying on the edge. Porky shuts the window while Rover pretends that he's going to fall. But he actually does fall. Porky runs down the stairs and tries to catch him, but unfortunately misses. Porky weeps for Rover and tries to wake him up. Rover finally wakes up glad to see Porky and kisses him. Then he uses the famous catchphrase of Lou Costello, "I'm a bad boy!".
