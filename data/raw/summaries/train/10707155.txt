A kind-hearted, widowed landlord, Thakur, lives a wealthy lifestyle with his son, Ramesh; daughter, Roopa; and an adopted child, Shankar. Ramesh hates Shankar and often abuses him. Years pass by. Thakur dies, and all three children have grown up. Ramesh  frequents a beautiful courtesan, drinks alcohol, and continues to abuse and mercilessly beat Shankar , who bears this in silence, as he and Roopa  are in love with each other. When Ramesh finds out that Roopa wants to wed Shankar, he has him severely beaten and thrown off a cliff. Ramesh then arranges Roopa's marriage to another wealthy man, Satish , while he continues to romance Tarabai  and even signs over his entire estate and home to her. A few years later, Shankar returns as the wealthy Raja of Belapur. He is fully prepared to compromise with Ramesh and propose to Roopa. He finds out that nothing has changed, however. Ramesh, though rendered penniless by Tara, still hates Shankar. Satish is engaged to Roopa and a marriage date has been fixed. Shankar's love is now replaced by vengeance and hate, and all he can think of is destroying the lives of Ramesh, Roopa, Satish and his sister, Mala , and he devises several plans to destroy his opponents' lives. He abuses and insults Roopa, attempting to avenge himself upon her for her apparent unfaithfulness by romancing Mala, but love conquers all in the end.
