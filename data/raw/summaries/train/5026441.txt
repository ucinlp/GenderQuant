Teenager Josh Framm's mother, Jackie, has just married her veterinarian boyfriend, Patrick Sullivan. Josh and his best friend, Tom Stewart, have just made their school's soccer team when their coach reveals that their team will become co-ed. Josh meets Emma, an attractive girl who just moved with her family from England; and not only will she be playing on his soccer team, but she also has a golden retriever named Molly. Molly quickly has puppies with Josh's basketball and football-playing dog, Buddy. Next, it is discovered that Buddy also has the uncanny ability to play soccer. Buddy has a uniform and is on the roster, leading Josh's soccer team to the state championship. However, trouble occurs when Buddy's six newborn puppies are kidnapped by two people who want to sell them for cash.
