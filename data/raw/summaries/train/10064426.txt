Jay-Taew, Cartoon, Mot-dum and Songkram are four aging katoey  who run a boarding house for boys in provincial Thailand. After helping to cover up the mysterious deaths of "Pancake" and Num-Ning, two local teens, their spirits begin to haunt the dormitory, forcing the "girls" to try all sorts of crazy schemes to get rid of the ghosts. Eventually, they realize that the only way to do this is to help the ghosts to avenge their deaths.
