The story concerns the tenants of a large terraced house in pre-World War II London. Among them are the Jossers , landlady Mrs. Vizzard , the eccentric spiritualist medium Mr. Squales , the colourful Connie Coke , and the young Percy Boone  and his mother . The misguided Percy is in love with the Jossers' daughter, and turns to crime to raise money to impress her. Unfortunately, he bungles a car theft and finds himself accused of murder. The ageing Mr. Josser  digs into his retirement fund to hire the boy a lawyer. Mr. Squales testifies against Percy, but in the process exposes his fakery  to his now-fianc√©e Mrs. Vizzard. Percy is found guilty, but his neighbours rally to his defence. With the assistance of the Jossers' staunchly socialist Uncle Henry ([[Stephen Murray , they gather thousands of signatures in a petition to gain him a reprieve. At the end of the film, Percy's supporters march through the rain to Parliament, only to discover just before their arrival that clemency has already been granted.
