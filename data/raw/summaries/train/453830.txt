In a small Southern town, John Little and Jimmy Price are police officers charged with enforcing the law. In a local election, Jimmy is chosen as Sheriff to the dislike of a few in town. With many counting on a good Sheriff, Jimmy works as hard as he can, although time and the town may be against him. A radio ad for the film summizes the story simply: "tick...tick...tick is the sound of time...running out".
