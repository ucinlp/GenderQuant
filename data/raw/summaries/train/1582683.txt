The film examines the experience of Manny Balestrero  who works as a musician in the Stork Club, a nightclub in New York City. Manny and Rose , his wife, have very little money. When Rose needs some dental work, Manny attempts to borrow on her insurance policy at the insurance office. Unfortunately, he bears a resemblance to an armed robber who had held up the office twice before, so the police are called. Manny is identified by several witnesses and, when providing a handwriting sample, he nervously misspells a word that was also misspelled on the robbery note. He is arrested and charged with the crime. His defense attorney, Frank O'Connor , builds a case based on mistaken identity. At the time of the first hold-up Manny was away on vacation with his family. At the time of the second hold-up, Manny had a swollen jaw - a fact which the insurance-office employee would have noticed if Manny had been the robber. Manny and Rose look for three witnesses to his presence at the vacation hotel on the day of the hold-up, but two have died in the intervening months and the third can not be found. The stress of all this has a devastating effect on Rose who slowly descends into depression and is ultimately institutionalized. During the trial, a juror bored with the minutiae of one witness's testimony makes a remark which prompts the judge to grant a mistrial. While Manny is awaiting re-trial, the real robber is arrested in the act of robbing a grocery store and Manny is exonerated. He visits Rose at the sanatorium to tell her the good news but she remains in an apathetic state. The film closes with a textual epilogue that reveals that two years later Rose recovered and the family moved to Florida.
