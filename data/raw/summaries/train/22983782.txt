Hal, an over sexed photographer, has a problem. He is due to marry Vinni in one weeks time and he's got cold feet. In fact, he's got frostbite. His friend, Little Ted, a scheming, sexually frustrated cartoonist is obsessed with Vinni, even though he dumped her when they went out together. Both Little Ted and Hal have their own plans to disrupt the imminent wedding and they separately call upon Mr.Mac, a world weary swimming coach, to help them out. On Hal's all day stag night, Little Ted sets in motion a disastrous chain of events when he persuades Mr.Mac to convince Petula,  to seduce Hal in a pub lavatory so that he can record it on Polaroid. Hal, in the meantime, wants Mr.Mac to seduce Vinni so that he can catch them in flagrante, giving him the excuse to call off the wedding. Meanwhile, Vinni has decided that she has no intention of marrying Hal and gate-crashes the pub crawl in order to finally have things out with him. In this Machiavellian comedy of errors, there is no saying who will end up with whom.
