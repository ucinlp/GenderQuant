Every 18 years, the martial artists' community will hold a martial arts contest to elect a new leader. Eva Palace's ruler wins the title and is tasked with eliminating the Ten Villains, who live in the Villains' Valley, a sanctuary for criminals. Yin Nam-tin  believes that the villains are innocent and attempts to stop his wife from killing them. The couple turn against each other and Yin manages to defeat his wife eventually, but becomes paralyzed and mute. Eva accepts a girl called More as her disciple and intends to groom her as her successor. Meanwhile, the Ten Villains accept Yin's son  as their student and plan to "nurture" him into the greatest villain ever. 18 years later, the grown-up Fishy meets More by coincidence and falls in love with her. When he participates in the contest later, he is shocked to discover that Eva is actually his mother, and More is in fact Eva's student.
