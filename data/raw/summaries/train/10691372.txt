Three young women team up to rent a beach house in Malibu. One of them lands a job in a high school thanks to an investment broker she meets jogging along the beach. Another is taking acting lessons and enjoys horseback riding, though the young owner of the stable, John Logan , turns out to be more interesting than the riding itself. And the third woman practices her guitar, shuns the owner of the studio where she records, and hangs out with her hunk cousin Steve, the fourth roommate in the house.
