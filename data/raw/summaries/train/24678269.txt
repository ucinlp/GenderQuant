Chiranjeev  lives a wealthy lifestyle along with his father, Kashiram , and three siblings: two sisters, one of whom is dumb, and a younger brother. While on a trip, his friend, Mohan , falls ill due to alcohol, and gets treated at an Ashram. This is where Chiranjeev meets with an employee, Sharada , who lives a poor lifestyle with her father, Ram Sharan. Chiranjeev and Sharada fall in love with each other, and he promises to get his father's permission and return to get married to her. On his way home he has an accident, and though he does survive after being treated by tribal people, he returns to the Ashram several days later and is informed that Sharada is now married to a wealthy and much older man. Heart-broken and devastated, Chiranjeev returns home only to get another shock: the male Sharada has married is none other than his very own father. Depressed and deeply frustrated, he takes to alcohol in a big way. Sharada talks him out of this, he repents and on her insistence, marries Chanchal , who come from a reputed family background. Things then get complicated when Chanchal finds that her husband and his stepmother had been in love before and may not have got over their feelings for each other.
