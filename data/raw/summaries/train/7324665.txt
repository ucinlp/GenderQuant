Cheech & Chong's The Corsican Brothers opens with a rock band  performing with their band in the streets throughout parts of France. Disliking their brand of music, the locals pay off the band to vacate and shortly after the two lead band members meet a gypsy storyteller. She tells them the story of the Corsican brothers who attempt to overthrow a cruel member of a monarchy. After the story they continue to play in the streets and give an epic final performance before the credits start to roll.
