Molly  is off the streets and studying to become a lawyer. Molly learns that Lt. Andrews, the person who helped her leave her past life, was murdered. Now she is back to avenge his killing. She seeks to track down the only witness, Johnny Glitter, and enlists the help of her old friends, Yo-Yo Charlie, Solly, and Kit Carson. They break Kit out of the sanitarium and find Johnny at his home right as the thugs who killed Andrews find him. Kit and Angel save Johnny in a shoot-out. In the mean time Angel discovers a scheme to buy up Hollywood Boulevard by intimidation and violence that Gerrard is perpetrating. Gerrard's men corner Kit, Solly, Angel and Johnny in an alley. Kit shoots the car, causing it to crash, and they capture Gerrard's son. The son gets loose and threatens them with a gun, but the phone rings and Kit shoots him to death. The caller is Gerrard, who has kidnapped Solly's baby, Little Buck, and offers to trade Buck for his son. They attempt to make the trade anyway. Upon discovering that the son is dead, a shootout ensues with Gerrard taking the baby. Kit takes out one thug and Johnny Glitter, shooting blindly, shoots the other and also himself. Angel confronts Gerrard on the top floor and Gerrard threatens to throw the baby down. Angel surrenders and Gerrard puts the baby down. But the baby is crawling to the edge, and Gerrard will not allow Angel to move. Solly sees what is happening and goes up to shoot Gerrard. Angel tries to get to the baby but the baby falls. Kit sees the baby fall and catches him. Angel and Solly come down with the baby safely wrapped in Kit's jacket.
