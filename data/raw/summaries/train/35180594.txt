Four young Algerians faced with a choice which one way or another will mark their lives forever: leave for Europe or protest in the streets. One of them will leave for Europe, he knows that he is leaving his country, perhaps for good, and will not see his friends again; the others will join the protests. It looks like last yearâ€™s Arab revolutions, but in fact the film refers to the eve of another great popular uprising, the one in Algeria in 1992.{{RefFCAAAL}}
