Marc has inherited the house of his late aunt on the Côte d'Azur and takes the family there on for their summer holiday, leaving their home in Paris. Charly, who has never had a girlfriend, is thought to be gay by his parents and Martin, who is gay, is also staying with them. Béatrix's lover Mathieu arrives in the village and manages to sneak opportunities to be with her. When Martin goes out one night to the local gay cruising area - an old fort on a nearby hillside - Charly follows him and meets Didier. After realising he isn't gay he calls Didier for help when the hot water stops working. Didier then meets Marc and they realise how much they missed each other from when Marc used to visit the area in his youth. Throughout everyone eats lots of fruits de mer, especially Sea Violets. At the end everyone sings a song called 'Fruits de Mer', each with their preferred partner.
