Athe Mazha Athe Veyil tells the story of a family and the problems faced by its members. Raghuraman  and Sreelakshmi  are government employees and due to their heavy work load, they could find little time to spare for their only son. Sreelakshmi finds her husband's attitude as indifferent, and accordingly, she gets even more demanding. She insists that her husband should co-operate even more in the household chores, and not just leave her alone to do all the work by herself. Raghuraman refuses to comply with Sreelakshmi's demands and this gradually leads to a rift between the two. In the clamor to establish their own territories right, they forget about their only son."Synopsis"
