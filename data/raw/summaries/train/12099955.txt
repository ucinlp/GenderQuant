Described as a comedy/drama/musical/romance, the story revolves around a Ukrainian immigrant named A.K.  who finances his dreams of rock glory by moonlighting as a cross-dressing dominatrix and his two female flatmates: Holly , a ballet dancer who works as a stripper and pole-dancer at a local club and Juliette , a pharmacy assistant who dreams of going to Africa to help starving children. The Gypsy punk band that appears in the film is portrayed by real-life Gypsy punk band, Gogol Bordello, who also contributed three songs to the film's soundtrack. The band's lead singer, Eugene Hütz, portrays the main character — a character with a philosophical attitude towards life. Madonna allowed additional dialogue written by Hütz himself to be included in the film.
