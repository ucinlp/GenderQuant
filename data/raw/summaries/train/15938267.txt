The conceptual base are the poetic monologues read by Sofia Rotaru playing herself, singer. The monologues were read by Sofia Rotaru in Russian, whereas their author, G. Vieru, has supposedly wrote them in Moldavian beforehand. In between the monologues, adapted music videos appear in all different kinds of scenery from Kazakh desert to Bukovinian rich green villages, passing by beautiful Crimean Black Sea and Lithuanian Baltic Sea shorelines. Sofia Rotaru performs personally in the movie without double stunt performers, namely the role of windsurfer in love, singing the song "Amor" in Moldavian language.
