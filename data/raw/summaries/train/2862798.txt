Lymon was thirteen years old when the teenage group Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers erupted from radios and jukeboxes with their 1956 hit, "Why Do Fools Fall in Love?" and appeared in the movie Rock, Rock, Rock . After Mr. Rock and Roll , Lymon started a solo singing career, but it all fell apart. Lymon's career was over by the time he was eighteen years old, and he died of a heroin overdose seven years later. Jumping from the 1950s to the 1980s, the film traces the rise and fall of Lymon  in a series of flashbacks as courtroom claims on Lymon's royalties are outlined by three women: Zola Taylor  of the Platters R&B group; Elizabeth Waters , who loves her pet dog . She became a prostitute to cover the costs of Lymon's recovery from addiction; and schoolteacher Emira Eagle . Little Richard also makes a courtroom appearance, while Miguel A. Nunez Jr. portrays Little Richard in scenes set in the 1950s. The film ends with Emira winning Frankie's estate, although Elizabeth was named the legal surviving spouse of Frankie Lymon.
