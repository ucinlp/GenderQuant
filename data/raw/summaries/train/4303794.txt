Henry Roth  is an obsessive-compulsive and somewhat misanthropic writer of children's books. His illustrator and only friend, Rudy , dies after a fabulously successful collaboration on their series of children's books about "Marty the Beaver." Henry is under contract to produce another Marty book for Christmas sales. His publisher, Arthur Planck , assigns penniless, lovelorn illustrator Lucy Reilly  to work with Henry. She's sought by her ex-boyfriend Jeremy , who dumped her two years ago but shows up apologetic, having dedicated his new book to her. She and Henry go to a house on the shore to work. Will love bloom amid the rocks, or is Henry a bump on Lucy's road to Jeremy? Rudy's voice, from the grave, gives Henry counsel.
