In 2006, George W. Bush, President of the United States, visited India. In addition to the many diplomatic and political things on the agenda was a rather unique event&nbsp;â€” a meeting with the young faces responsible for shaping "The New India". The six contestants are Maya Roy India's best young Writer, Ajay Karlekar India's best young Social Activist, Archana Kapoor India's best young Indian Entrepreneur, Rohit Seth Call Center Accent Trainer, Kapil Dev Dholakia India's best young Stock Investor, Ramesh S Software Engineer. They have to undergo bizarre tests and activities to top the list. In the end only two are left Kapil and Maya. Kapil is caught cheating in the final round and Maya is selected. But with bizarre turn of events she is not the one who shakes the hand.
