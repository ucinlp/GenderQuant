An offscreen English gentleman  converses with the relaxing Pink Panther on a quiet Sunday afternoon, badgering him into doing some housework. Typically, the Pink Panther encounters several mishaps around the house. He manages to soak himself while trying to fix a leaky faucet, leading to the entire house being flooded. The panther also sets a power saw in motion, slicing off his tail and ultimately cutting his house in half. Plus, the basement lightblub continually goes dark every time the panther enters, leading him to stumble down the steps each and every time. Despite the endless mishaps, the English gentleman persists, irritating the feline. Finally, the Pink Panther loads a blunderbuss, giving the Englishman the impression that the panther is going to shoot him, but he shoots the faulty basement lightbulb, but backfire causes the panther to get trapped in a luggage he took the blunderbuss from.
