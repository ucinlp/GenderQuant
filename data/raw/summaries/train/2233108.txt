{{Main}} The series revolves around a teenager named Chris living in 1980s Brooklyn in the ghetto of Bedford-Stuyvesant with his ill-tempered, surly, easily-paranoid mother Rochelle, lucky, admired, idolized younger brother Drew, cheap father Julius, and spoiled, deceptive younger sister Tonya, all of whom have been known to either domineer, mistreat, or agitate him in some way. As opposed to the popularity and unlimited fortune and charm possessed by his brother, Chris's life is plagued by an abundance of disadvantages; he is mercilessly harassed by his bullying, racially-prejudiced schoolmates, the material items of his desires often cannot be purchased easily, his home life is unpleasant often, his grades in school are poor, he is despised by girls, and resides in an environment populated partially by gangsters, muggers, thiefs, and con artists. Despite this, he is also commonly assisted by his unpopular, geeky only friend Greg in accomplishing goals that he frequently sets for himself such as being elected class president or earning the money to purchase his desires, although episodes normally end with more misfortune and unhappiness for Chris as his plans often may backfire on him somehow or end with him about to receive harsh discipline or a scolding from Rochelle.
