Rajesh Tripathi lives a poor lifestyle in a village in India along with his widower dad, Shivshankar. He leaves his father so that he can study in Bombay. While there he becomes a fan of singer and dancer, Neha, and even paints hoardings for her shows. During the holidays, he returns home to his village and gets a surprise when he finds that Neha has also re-located there. His overtures to become friendly with her end up in getting the police involved for alleged molestation. After clearing his name, Neha then entraps him to accompany her to an isolated shack and locks him there, which almost kills him. After this incident Neha does accept his friendship and confides in him that she can never sing as she has been poisoned by her former manager, Hari Saxena, so much so that her vocal cords have been damaged repair. Rajesh accepts the challenge and sets about to resurrect Neha's voice and her career - not knowing that both of them may end up being targets of Hari - who has planned a devious ending for Neha and anyone who supports her.
