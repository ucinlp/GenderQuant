Rudolph Strelitz, known as ‘Barrabas’, is the brutal leader of an underground gang who causes mayhem and destruction to the lives of civilized people. A lawyer, Claude Varèse, is strongly determined to bring Strelitz to justice for the purpose of revenge, after his father was wrongly guillotined for the murder of Laure d’Hérigny, a mistress of a missing American millionaire. Later Claude Varèse’s sister, Françoise, is then abducted by the evil Dr Lucius, one of Barrabas’ henchmen.
