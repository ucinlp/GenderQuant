The film is set around the paterfamilias of the Lovejoy family in Lancashire winning a large sum on the pools. With this windfall he buys a small tea-shop in a more upper-class section of their town, and generally lives the high life. His daughter falls in love with an aristocratic visitor to the shop, but her mother stands in her way, until all is happily resolved by the end.
