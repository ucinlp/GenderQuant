Anupama Kaul  is a woman whose sister lives in New York. One day she gets a call from her sister and while they are talking on the phone, her sister is killed by the 9/11 attacks. Anupama is devastated. A few years later Anu is happily engaged to Arpit Oberoi ; then Arpit leaves for America for business reasons and Anu is wooed by a man named Aman (played by [[John Abraham . When Arpit comes back from America, Anu tells him that she is in love with Aman and she can't marry Arpit. Then Arpit starts asking questions: Who is Aman? Where does he live? She can answer these questions but there's no evidence to support her answers, which leads Arpit to ask "Does he even exist?" The truth is Aman doesn't exist. He is just a figment of Anupama's imagination. Her friends and family try to explain to her that Aman doesn't exist. Anupama refuses to listen. Then, suddenly, Aman comes and everyone can see him. On Anupama's and Aman's wedding day Aman confesses that he is really Arpit and that he got plastic surgery. The only way that his face looks exactly like Aman's is that Arpit got the drawings from Anupama's sketchbook. Anupama doesn't believe him and still believes that he is truly Aman. Anupama's best friend asks her to show proof. Anupama shows pictures of her and Aman at the movies when Arpit is still in America without even taking a second glance at the pictures. Her friend shows the pictures to her and she sees that Aman wasn't there. He was just a part of her imagination. Arpit and Anupama soon get married.
