{{plot|dateContinuity"TLotTLff">{{cite web|urlDoctor Who - Fact File - "The Last of the Time Lords"|accessdate"TLotTLff"/> It is used as such again in "Voyage of the Damned". *The Doctor's trial and subsequent exile to Earth by the Time Lords in The War Games and the lifting of that sentence in the The Three Doctors are mentioned. *The Fifth Doctor is later imprisoned in the Matrix by Omega in Arc of Infinity and the Sixth Doctor fights a similar virtual battle with The Valeyard in the final episodes of The Trial of a Time Lord. *This is the first story to state that there is a limitation to the number of times that a Time Lord can regenerate, and that this number is twelve. However, none of the Time Lords who die in this episode are seen to regenerate. *This story establishes the Matrix or APC net. The Invasion of Time establishes that the President has full control of the Matrix. Omega is able to take control of it in Arc of Infinity, and the stealing of secret information from the Matrix sets in motion the events of The Trial of a Time Lord. *The source of the Time Lords' power and that of the TARDIS is the Eye of Harmony, the nucleus of a black hole that lies beneath the Citadel on Gallifrey. The Eye, or a link to it, is seen inside the TARDIS in the 1996 television movie. *This story introduces Rassilon who, along with Omega , would become the central figure in Time Lord mythology. When Rassilon is first mentioned, the Doctor inquires who he is, seeming ambiguous about his knowledge of the name. *One of the artefacts that controls the Eye of Harmony is the Great Key of Rassilon, a large ebonite rod. There are two other Keys of Rassilon mentioned later in the series. One, also known as the Great Key, whose location is known only to the Chancellor, resembles an ordinary key and is a vital component of the demat gun . The other, simply called the Key of Rassilon, gives access to the Matrix . *Spandrell casually mentions the Celestial Intervention Agency and it is implied that they had a hand in commuting the Doctor's exile in The Three Doctors. The CIA feature prominently in spin-off novels and audios plays.{{Citation needed}}
