Do-gooder Deepak Rai  comes across a stolen purse that contains education certificates belonging to a woman named Aarthi. He mails them to her and they start a correspondence. Even though they have never seen each other, both feel an attraction. Aarthi's sister and brother-in-law Nirmal  are encouraging to a certain extent. While Nirmal would prefer that Aarthi marry Prem , his wife wants Aarthi to choose her own life partner. Aarthi starts out on her journey to locate and meet Deepak. But how is Aarthi to find someone, whom she has never seen, nor spoken to, nor know his whereabouts, in a big city like Delhi? And then there is Neha , who is Deepak's boss, but has some plans of her own for Deepak that do not involve Aarthi at all.
