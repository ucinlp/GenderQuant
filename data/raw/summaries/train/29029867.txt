On a quiet suburban road a motor car appears from around a corner in the distance. Two male pedestrians cross the road in front of the vehicle. As the car approaches it is seen to contain a male driver and three high-spirited female passengers waving handkerchiefs towards the camera. The car reaches the foreground and explodes without warning, leaving a smouldering pile of twisted wreckage. A policeman  happens to be passing, takes out a telescope and looks up to the sky. After a lapse of several seconds he has to dodge out of the way as torsos and severed limbs  start to rain down around him. Unperturbed, the helpful policeman takes out his notebook and begins the task of reassembling the assorted body parts, still neatly-clothed, into identifiable human beings, conscientiously making notes as he goes.
