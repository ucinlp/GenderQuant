Because one of Larry's silly songs, "The Song of the Cebu" was so silly and confusing, Archibald Asparagus has replaced Silly Songs with Larry with "Love Songs with Mr. Lunt" which makes Larry very depressed and to drown his sorrows in Jimmy's ice cream parlor. Jimmy tries to cheer up Larry by showing some other silly songs from the past on his parlor's Jukebox, but fails miserably and he still does not understand why Larry is so upset. Archibald later appears with his wife and at first tries to avoid being recognized by Larry, but eventually he reveals himself and shows Mr. Lunt's silly song, "His Cheeseburger", revealing the reason for Larry's depression. After seeing this, Jimmy is angry and stands up for Larry, stating that he would feel the same way if he were in Larry's position. Archibald then apologizes and reads Larry a petition from millions of fans, which says the misunderstanding from "The Song of the Cebu" should be forgiven and later includes that Larry can perform his silly songs again. Larry is overjoyed and is given the honors to put in his latest silly song. The episode then concludes with Larry playing the song "Yodelling Veterinarian of the Alps."
