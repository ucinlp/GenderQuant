In its view on history, evil King John resumes his old ways after the death of Richard the Lionheart with the plan to keep his power by importing Continental mercenaries and paying them through oppressive taxation. King John first attempts to kill the son of his old nemesis Robin. His henchmen fix a faulty protective cap to the lance of a Flemish Knight who challenges Robin in a joust. When Robin survives the lance attack he challenges his opponent to a joust without protective devices, impaling the Flemish Knight. Having returned from the Crusades, Robin and Little John re-recruit the aging Merrie Men who wage a guerilla type war throughout the realm with intelligence provided by Lady Marianne's carrier pigeons. The film concludes with Robin and the Archbishop of Canterbury compelling the defeated King John to seal the Magna Carta.p.56 Fraser, George MacDonald The Hollywood History of the World Penguin Book group, 1988
