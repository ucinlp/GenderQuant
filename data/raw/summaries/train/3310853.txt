A couple of newlyweds, Olga and Michael, are traveling along the desert and accidentally trespass on the property of Magda Urtado , who is the director of a boot camp of sorts, where the women are treated as slaves and are half naked at all times. Magda keeps Olga in captivity while Michael is free to go, but later on in the film he plans an escape for Olga. She goes to work with the other girls out in the hot desert, and from there the plot just goes out in all different directions. There are a couple subplots in which a few of the workers are sent out to be hookers, one where a worker participates in a deadly game of cat and mouse, and one where the Governor  is having trouble getting it on with his wife so he buys a couple of the workers to help him perform. There is also a scene where the Governor is finally able to have sex with his wife, but only while watching one of the females be raped by a dog. Director Jess Franco also stars in the movie as an obviously gay man.
