This cartoon is a semi-remake of Friz Freleng's Bunker Hill Bunny. A group of starving mice are admiring Daffy Duck's Mexican plantation , all the while wishing to have some of his home grown food. Evil land baron, Daffy, who isn't particularly fond of beggars, suddenly appears and angrily whips the mice for "starving on his property." Unfortunately, Speedy Gonzales interrupts and startles Daffy, at which the little black duck declares war on the mouse. The two proceed to do battle in private forts, resorting to everything from cannonfire to mine fields. At the end, Speedy  quits and goes home. Daffy then declares victory and rewards himself with a 21 gun salute. Unfortunately, as he pulls the strings to fire his cannons, the cannons flip in his direction  and blast him one-by-one .
