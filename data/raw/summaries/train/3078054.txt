Stucker, Minor and Pataki are cast as a gay fashion designer, a horny soul brother  and an incompetent impressionist, respectively. The three escape their mental asylum and sexually assault their way into a girls' school. Their broad, knockabout performances attempt to keep the film's  content amusing rather than disturbing. The entire female cast comprises softcore porn models  who don skimpy karate costumes and violently turn the tables on their tormentors.
