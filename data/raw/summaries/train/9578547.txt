A group of teenagers from the housing projects of the Paris suburbs practice a passage from the play Games of Love and Chance by Marivaux for their French class. Abdelkrim, or Krimo, who initially does not act in the play, falls in love with Lydia. In order to try to seduce her, he accepts the role of Arlequin and joins the rehearsal. But his timidness and awkwardness keeps him from participating in the play as well as succeeding with Lydia.
