The story is based loosely on real events and real people, drawing on famous David N. Thomas' book Dylan Thomas: A Farm, Two Mansions and a Bungalow. During the London blitz of World War II, Vera Phillips  runs into her first love, a charismatic Welsh poet Dylan Thomas . Their feelings for each other are rekindled, despite the fact that Dylan is now married to and has a child with the spirited Caitlin Macnamara . In spite of their initial rivalry, the two women become best friends, and, drinking heavily in wartime London, the three get along well. At this time, William Killick , a British soldier smitten by Vera, pursues her. They fall in love and marry, but soon after William is posted to war. Vera gives birth to his baby, and she and the Thomases move to the Welsh seashore to raise their children in two small, neighboring cottages where Vera and Caitlin's friendship grows ever closer. One day, however, Dylan enamors Vera into an affair. William, scarred by the horrors of war, eventually returns home where Vera notices his emotional distance and instability. In his disquiet, William grows suspicious of his wife's infidelity. Severely drunk one night, and angry with Dylan's friends' ignorant discourse of war, he returns home and fires multiple shots into the Thomas' house, though he hits no one. In the morning, he is arrested by the British police and taken to trial. During the trial, Dylan testifies against William by exaggerating the facts, stating he believed Killick was not only sober, but also that Killick intended to kill him, his wife, and his child. The jury finds William innocent of intent to murder, and he returns home. He accepts his new role as a father, and Vera forgives him, rekindling their relationship. Soon after, the Thomases move out of their cottage. During the farewell, Vera, unable to forgive him for testifying against her husband, ignores Dylan, but Vera and Caitlin restore their friendship, remaining close friends.
