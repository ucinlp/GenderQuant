When the wealthy count Waldemar Daninsky kills a wolf on his grounds, it transforms into a gypsy upon death, and he finds himself cursed by a vengeful gypsy witch who is angry about him killing one of her band. The witch orders a young, beautiful gypsy girl to seduce Daninsky and then, while he is sleeping, bite him with the skull of a wolf which she smuggles into the count's mansion. When she presses the skull's fangs into his skin, Waldemar becomes a werewolf . The film also mentions an ancient curse that was placed on Waldemar's ancestor  hundreds of years ago by a medieval sorceress named Countess Bathory. Apparently his ancestor had Bathory burned at the stake, but not before she managed to curse his entire family line. Now in 1972, the Daninsky curse has struck Waldemar, who is transformed into a monster by the bite of the gypsy's wolf skull. The Countess Bathory is later revived from the dead to combat el Hombre Lobo in the grand finale.
