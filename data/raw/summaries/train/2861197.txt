He gets his wish when he begins investigating an embezzlement case and meets model Mona Stevens . Forbes is tasked with getting hold of some expensive gifts given to Stevens, the girlfriend of an embezzler who's serving time in prison. Insurance agent Forbes ends up spending the day with the sultry blond on her speedboat, appropriately named "Tempest," and a romance begins brewing. Forbes, attracted to the blond, fudges the reports so he won't have to take the boat away from her. But the couple find themselves being stalked and threatened by a jealous, and suspicious, ex-cop . As the ex-police officer's sadistic obsession grows, and the day of her jailbird boyfriend's release from prison approaches, Mona fears for her safety and John longs for the days before he got involved in all this trouble. Things finally go too far when he turns to murder.
