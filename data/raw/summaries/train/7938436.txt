Stan and Ollie are mousetrap salesmen hoping for better business in Switzerland, with Stan's theory that because there is more cheese in Switzerland, there should be more mice. While visiting one village, a cheese shop owner cons them out of their wares with a bogus banknote, and they are forced to work as dishwashers in a nearby hotel after ordering a slap-up meal they are unable to pay for. A Viennese composer present at the hotel is disrupted by the presence of his wife - an opera singer who upstages him constantly; Ollie subsequently falls in love with her. After various adventures , the boys overpower the hotel's burly chef and leave the hotel and village, but only to discover the opera singer is indeed married to the composer and then be confronted by the vengeful gorilla  before they depart.
