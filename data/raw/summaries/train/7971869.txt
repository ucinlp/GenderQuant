Ollie wants to join Stan for an afternoon of fun, but his wife has other ideas. She demands he install the radio antenna atop their roof, a job he has been neglecting for several weeks. Soon, Stan stops by to "help" his friend. After destroying the Hardys' chimney and falling from the roof several times, they perch a ladder in the back seat of Stan's car. The car shifts into gear, and speeds uncontrollably through city with Ollie still atop the ladder.
