Grant, as "Poppy" Rose, is the harried husband of Anna, played by his real-life wife at the time, Betsy Drake. Anna has a place in her heart for foster children, and is able to draw out these neglected children and make them real members of the family, despite their various personality differences and physical challenges. Poppy, who on the surface seems reluctant to open his home to "one more", is, underneath, putty in the children's hands, from start to finish.
