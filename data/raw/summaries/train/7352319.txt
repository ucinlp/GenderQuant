Oliver Beresford is a controlling and uncompromisingly rigid father. When shameful stories about his daughter Judith surface, he bans her from his house. Her brother David is training for the ministry at his fatherâ€™s insistence, but he has secretly wed Nan Higgins, the stepdaughter of an 'odd-jobs man', and has fathered, then abandoned his child. Nan travels up to New York where she becomes a prostitute after the baby is born. Judith goes to New York, to make a career for herself, and finds Nan and her baby just as the young woman is dying. Judith decides to raise the child, and later she returns to New England, on the day that David is to be ordained, and confronts him with the child in front of the congregation.Hail the Woman at silentera.com database
