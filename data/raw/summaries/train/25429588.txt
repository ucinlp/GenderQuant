Three social outcasts who live near the seaside interact with each other in increasingly disturbing ways. The trio of characters are a woman who has killed her sister, a man who enjoys necrophilia, and a female amnesiac. The first woman engages in sadistic pursuits such as capturing young women at the beach to force them to engage in sexual activities, including copulation with a horse and a dog.{{cite book |lastThomas|coauthorsJapanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films|yearVital Books : Asian Cult Cinema Publications|location1-889288-52-7|pages"allmovie">{{cite web}}
