Buster Edwards  is a petty criminal from the East End of 1960s London. His long-suffering wife June  thinks of him as a loveable rogue and cannot believe it when she learns of his involvement in the Great Train Robbery. For several months after the robbery, Buster and June are in hiding with their young daughter Nicky  until they are turned in to the police by a suspicious neighbour. Buster flees to Acapulco where he is met by fellow Great Train Robber Bruce Reynolds ([[Larry Lamb  and his girlfriend Franny Reynolds  who are also on the run and living it up in the sun with the profits of their crime. June and Nicky arrive despite the disapproval of her mother  and although Nicky seems to love her new life in the sun, June is immediately not keen on their new way of life, resolving to return to England, despite knowing that if Buster is to return with them, then this will mean imprisonment for him. Buster remains in Acapulco for some time after June leaves, until realising  that despite him having money and the sun, it means nothing if he doesn't have his family and returns to England to accept his punishment. The film closes, 12 years after Buster's release from jail, seemingly content and running a flower stall near Waterloo Bridge on the Thames.
