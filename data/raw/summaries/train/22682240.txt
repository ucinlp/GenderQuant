The film focuses on a group of cavers who, during a cave-in accident, cut off the arm of one of their fellow cavers in order to avoid starvation. Mere moments after the grisly act, however, the entire group is rescued. Several years later, the caver group has gone separate ways but then one by one they are killed by having their arm hacked off in the same way as their original victim. All suspect their original victim  and contact the victim's daughter who offers to help find her father and stop the killings. In the end, it is revealed that the daughter was behind the killings and she kidnaps the original leader of the caver crew who came up with the idea to cut her father's arm off. The man is then sealed in a room below an isolated country house where he will put to death by slow torture...mainly, starving to death unless he cuts off his own arm.
