The story is of terrorism that’s plaguing different parts of the Northeast as the backdrop. Shilajeet Majumdar, a militant on the run, takes refuge in a dilapidated mansion. Rupa Ganguly stays there with her father-in-law Soumitra Chatterjee and his father Haradhan Bandopadhyay who’s confined to bed and is unable to speak. This film focuses on the friction and undercurrent of tension between the lady of the house and the terrorist. It leads to a brief mutual self-discovery that gives rise to compassion.
