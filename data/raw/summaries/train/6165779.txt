One summer in the small, sleepy town of Antler, Texas, Toby Wilson's life changes. Toby is a boy who lives with his parents, but his mother runs off to Nashville to become a singer. Later, he and his best friend Cal McKnight meet a fat, adolescent sideshow freak named Zachary Beaver, who has no parents or friends. Zachary, "The Fattest Boy Ever," spends most of his time in a camp trailer; he is abandoned by the person who watches him from the circus. Toby and Cal get to know him, and soon become friends with him. They cope with the loss of Cal's brother, Wayne, who usually takes them out for snow cones and, who joins the army and later dies, which makes Cal really upset, and Toby doesn't come to his funeral to bring Zachary somewhere in his dad's truck, and they get stranded in the middle of nowhere but get home. Zachary's home will be taken away, and Toby gets in trouble with his father, and Cal is very upset at him and gives him back all the money he borrowed from him and tells him his mother is never coming back like Wayne. Toby gives a country girl he likes a necklace, which was his mother's, but she gives it back to him. He got to have his dance with her after her boyfriend broke up with her. Cal and Toby become friends after Toby chases him down to a lake and they help Zachary get baptized in a lake with a pastor; later his guardian returns with circus freaks to adopt him. He leaves town with them and says goodbye to his new friends.
