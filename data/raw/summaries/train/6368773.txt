Her mother has been working hard and long lately because she needs the money to support herself and her children. The father does not pay child support often, which causes the family money problems. Lily, Meg's younger sister, has serious mental problems; she has been starving herself to become an angel. After being checked into the psychiatric ward of a hospital, Lily kills herself by jumping out of an open window as she tries to "fly". Meg finds solace in her English teacher, who claims he is passionate about writing a novel. Her English teacher becomes a comfort and a father figure to her through Meg's troubled times, and he encourages her to join a poetry contest. A closer sexual relationship develops between Meg and her teacher until she finally allows him to have sex with her. After this, Meg, looking through material on the top of a desk, realizes that her teacher has not written a novel, but had told that story to impress her. The movie is melancholy. Meg decides to live with her father, and she enters his blue car, still uncertain about her future.
