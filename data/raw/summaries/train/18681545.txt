Charles-Ingvar "Sickan" JÃ¶nsson is a new student in Dynamit-Harry's and Ragnars's school. He instantly gets bullied by Junior and Biffen for his nerdy look. The year is 1953 and small cards called 'filmisar', that are found in cornflakes boxes, are popular at the school. Sickans first coup will be to get as many 'filmisar' as he can by sneaking in to the cornflakes factory with his newly made friends Harry and Ragnar.
