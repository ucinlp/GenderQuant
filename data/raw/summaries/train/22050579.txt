The story centers around Pamela McCallister , an average girl who works in a department store and lives in a boardinghouse in New York. Into her life comes a generous benefactor who gives her a million dollars. Pam is excited at first, buying gifts for her boardinghouse friends, and her songwriter boyfriend, who lives across the hall from her. Much to her surprise, her friends and boyfriend seem to change overnight. They are not as overjoyed at her good fortune as she imagines they would be, and rather resent her. As the last straw, her boyfriend tells her she's an Elsie Dinsmore and breaks it off with her. Pam finally decides on a course of action that makes her happy, as well as those around her.
