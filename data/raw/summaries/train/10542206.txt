Special Agent Jennifer Marsh  is a widowed single parent living in a suburban Portland home with her daughter, Annie Haskins . At night, she works in the FBI's cybercrime division with Griffin Dowd , fighting identity theft and similar crimes. One night, an anonymous tip leads them to a website called KillWithMe.com. The site features a streaming video of a kitten being tortured and killed. The website cannot be shut down, as the creator knew that someone would try and built into it a fail-safe; every time the server is closed, a mirror server immediately replaces it. After the kitten's death, KillWithMe.com's webmaster graduates to human victims and makes their deaths correlate directly with the number of hits the site receives. At a press conference, the public is urged to avoid the website, but as Jennifer feared this only increases the site's popularity. The videos are recorded in the killer's basement and his various victims include a helicopter pilot , a newscaster , and Griffin Dowd . At first it seems the victims were randomly chosen, but this is revealed to be untrue: the first two victims were chosen because they were part of filming or presenting the suicide of a junior college teacher. The teacher's unstable techno prodigy son, Owen Reilly ([[Joseph Cross , broke down and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. When released, he decided to prove a point; that the public's interest in the suffering of others is insatiable, as well as wreak vengeance on those he felt had exploited his father's death. Griffin was killed because he came close to discovering the murderer's identity, and Jennifer is soon targeted after figuring this out as well. Captured by Owen, Jennifer escapes her death by cultivator by swinging out of the way while dangling from the ceiling. She breaks free and pins down the murderer, fatally shooting Owen on his own website as the police arrive. As the film ends, Jennifer displays her FBI badge and the scene closes with a shot of the dwindling chatter in the website's chat room, showing statements being made such as "a genius died today" as well as "glad the killer is dead", and a final comment asking whether the video could be downloaded.
