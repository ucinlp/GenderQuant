Marie , a student, works at her father's Swiss gas station and plays basketball for a local team; she claims to be a virgin and maintains a chaste relationship with her boyfriend Joseph , a taxi cab driver, who is a dropout. When a passing stranger named Uncle Gabriel   informs Marie that she will become pregnant despite remaining chaste, and give birth to the son of God, she is at first shocked and confused. Joseph, however, cannot believe that she is pregnant and a virgin. Gabriel must school Joseph to accept Mary's pregnancy, while Mary comes to terms with God's plan through meditations that are sometimes angry and usually punctuated by elemental images of the sun, moon, clouds, flowers, and water. Godard intercuts a brief parallel story of Eva , a college student and her nameless professor , who talks about life having been programmed by "a prior intelligence"; their adulterous affair is rife with philosophical discussions. In time, Joseph's anger subsides, and the expectant couple marries. After they are wed Mary teaches Joseph to love her from a distance, revering her without touching her. Joseph eventually swears to keep his hands off his bride and to act as her shadow, to which she responds, "But isn't that what all men are, the shadow of God?" They raise their son, Jesus , who eventually leaves his family to pursue "his father's business." Meanwhile Marie explores her sexuality, seeking to link her individual body and spirit.
