Two young girls, Anupama  and Rahael , rent an old palace and are disturbed by the presence of a strange lady who moves around their place. They are adamant on finding out the truth about her. The palace's manager , also a witchcraft practitioner, is keen to help them. As the girls find it difficult to move forward in their enquiry, the second story begins. The second story follows when Jeeva , a police officer, falls in love with Bala , who is a budding writer. Their professions intervene with their personal lives, preventing them from any serious romancing prior to marriage. Soon after their marriage, Jeeva receives a job transfer to the high ranges of Idukki. Bala is excited at the prospect, as she feels the salubrious mountain atmosphere will help nurture her writing skills. Jeeva is also looking forward to it, as a perfect opportunity to rekindle their lost romance. However, despite the positive atmosphere, life at the bungalow soon takes an unexpected twist. Life for the couple turns uneasy, as Bala senses someone, apart from the two of them, inhabiting the bungalow. Haunted by a perpetual paranoia, she wakes up most nights to nightmares. Jeeva, concerned with how their marriage is turning out, finally agrees to investigate. The investigation leads him into the unknown realms of the bungalow's shady past, unravelling a forgotten history, thus leading to a startling realisation of who the "third someone" is.
