Believing she is being rejected by her boyfriend Sam, Joey attempts suicide with sleeping pills, but recovers after having her stomach pumped. When she looks forward to a brand new life, she discovers that she is pregnant. Being tortured by the thought of an abortion and unable to contact Sam, the man she knows is her baby's father, Joey finds herself becoming delusional and emotionally unstable. Joey begins to see the spirits of dead people , and also feels stalked by a mysterious ghost woman. She believes the ghost wants to hurt her unborn baby. As the story unfolds, it is discovered that the ghost is Sam's wife who, after overhearing a phone conversation between Joey and Sam, and feeling rejected by her husband, committed suicide by jumping in front of an oncoming train. She is now awaiting Joey's baby's birth so that she may be reincarnated within her. After discovering this, Joey would rather kill herself and her baby than let this woman become her child. While in a hospital, awaiting the birth of her child, Joey jumps off the building, but survives, gives birth and in the end coming to terms with her situation. Her psychiatrist's explanation is that Joey feels guilty about Sam's wife's suicide and that the whole story about accepting or not the ghost in her baby's body is Joey's struggle between accepting or rejecting her moral part of responsibility in Sam's wife's suicide. Finally she accepts this responsibility, at the cost of partially losing contact with reality, no longer recognizing Sam and disillusioned about her baby's father. As Joey checks out of the hospital, the camera pans across a room of expecting mothers, each with a ghost hovering by their sides.
