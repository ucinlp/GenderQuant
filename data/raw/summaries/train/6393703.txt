Man in the Mirror picks up from where An American Dream left off. At the beginning of the telefilm, it is set to 1983 where pop icon Michael Jackson, and his album, Thriller becomes the biggest selling album of all-time. Michael  grew up in the spotlight as a member of the popular R&B combo the Jackson 5, but his youthful success came with a priceâ€”robbed of a normal childhood, as he grew to be a man, Jackson found himself increasingly eager to remake his life into the childhood he never had. In the 1980s, Jackson's solo career blew up, and his album Thriller became the biggest selling album of all time, moving over 100 million copies and making him wealthy beyond his wildest dreams. As Jackson struggled to repeat its success, his public image and reputation became increasingly eccentric, and as allegations of drug abuse, excessive plastic surgery, and inappropriate behavior with children were thrown at him, Jackson found himself trapped between his desire to entertain his fans and proving to the world that he was a normal and law-abiding man.
