 Geoff Carter  is a pilot and the manager of Barranca Airways, a small, barely solvent air service owned by "Dutchy" Van Reiter  carrying mail from the fictional South American port town of Barranca over the Andes Mountains. Bonnie Lee , a piano-playing entertainer, arrives one day and becomes infatuated with Carter, despite his fatalistic attitude about the dangerous mountain flying, and stays on in Barranca . The situation is complicated by the appearance of Bat MacPherson  and his wife Judy . MacPherson is a pilot shunned by other fliers because he once bailed out of a plane, leaving his mechanic &mdash; the brother of "Kid" Dabb ([[Thomas Mitchell , Carter's best friend &mdash; to be killed in the resulting crash. Carter needs pilots desperately, but he is unwilling to hire MacPherson even so. However, when Judy begs him to give her husband a chance, he gives in, with the proviso that MacPherson will get the most dangerous flights. MacPherson understands and accepts the setup: none of the other pilots would shed a tear if he were lost. Dutchy will secure a lucrative government mail contract that would put the airline on a solid financial footing if he can provide reliable service during a trial period. On the last day of the trial, bad weather closes a mountain pass. Bat and Kid try flying over the mountains in a new Ford Trimotor instead. However, they are unable to climb high enough. On the way back, a bird crashes through the windshield, paralyzing Kid. Bat refuses to bail out and manages to land the burning plane. Kid dies, but not before telling Geoff of Bat's heroism. As a result, Bat is finally welcomed by the others. Bonnie finally gives up on Geoff and bids him goodbye. He offers to toss a coin to decide: heads, she stays; tails, she leaves. Then the weather clears; Geoff rushes out to secure the all-important contract. Bonnie is unwilling to decide her life so haphazardly, until she sees that the coin has heads on both sides.
