Eccentric Jeffrey Mannus  is 29 years old and lives with his mother, Jan . He sees no reason to alter this arrangement, but his perfect world is upended when Jan meets Mert Rosenbloom , a motivational speaker. Mert successfully woos Jan and moves in on Jeffrey's territory, something Jeffrey will not tolerate. While at a coffee shop, Jeffrey finds a friend in one of the workers and later enlists the aid of her as his unlikely ally, an aspiring singer-songwriter, Nora Flannagan , with an anti-establishment penchant and a soft spot for him. As the war between Mert and Jeffrey escalates, something unprecedented happens â€” slowly, to both his own surprise and horror, Jeffrey discovers his inner adult. However, before this happens, Jeffrey and Mert get into a fist fight in Jan's home, causing her to break up with him. Jeffrey is pleased, but Jan kicks him out of the house. He goes to find Nora, who is currently upset with him for being such a "jerk", who does not offer any help. Jeffrey lives on the streets, but is eventually arrested for urinating in a sink. Seymore comes to the rescue and pays his bail, also allowing him to move in with him. Jeffrey realizes his errors and fights to get Jan and Mert back together. After achieving this he goes to stop the bus that Nora is riding, as she left for college, in his new car. He parks it in the middle of the road and stands on the hood, holding up a radio that is playing one of Nora's favorite songs. The bus driver makes Nora talk to him and they make up. They then drive off into the distance and the screen fades to black.
