The film is a musical with a slim plot, involving theater producers  staging a wartime charity program, only to have the production taken over by their egotistical star . Meanwhile, an aspiring singer  and his songwriter girlfriend  conspire to get into the charity program by replacing Cantor with their look-alike friend, tour bus driver Joe Simpson . Many of Warner Brothers stars performed in musical numbers, including several who were not known as singers. The film features the only screen musical numbers ever done by Bette Davis, Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, and Ida Lupino. Each of the cast members was paid a $50,000 fee for their appearance which was then donated to the Hollywood Canteen.Spada . p.194 The film was popular with audiences, and the critic James Agee called it "the loudest and most vulgar of the current musicals. It is also the most fun."Ringgold, Gene, The Films of Bette Davis, Cadillac Publishing Co., 1966, p.123 Ticket sales combined with the donated salaries of the performers raised more than two million dollars for the Hollywood CanteenSpada, James, More Than a Woman, Little, Brown and Company, 1993, ISBN 0-316-90880-0 p 195
