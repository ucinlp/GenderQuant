Sunny is the orphaned child of a former knife throwing master. After his father's death, he is taken in by his uncle, who allows him to perform as a clown, since he did not inherit his father's knife throwing skills. Sunny still wants to be a knife thrower, though. He is tormented by his cousins, who are all performers in his uncle's troupe. One day, Sunny overhears a plan the rest of the troupe a making to explore a cave, rumored to be filled with gold. Instead of killing Sunny, they use him as the point man for their expedition. They find crates filled with capsules and force Sunny to open them. Inside the first are numerous plates of gold. They then try to kill Sunny, and continue opening the rest of the capsules, which end up containing experimental gas which transforms them into superhuman monsters.
