Two aging men try to buy a new fishing boat, but their Brooklyn pier is controlled by a gangster. The fishermen plan to kill the gangster, but neither can go through with it. When the gangster learns of their plan, he attempts to strike one of them but falls into the sea and drowns. The Motion Picture Production Code would not have let the fishermen go unpunished if they had killed the gangster.{{cite journal|lastBrian|yearThe Hollywood Left: Robert Rossen and Postwar Hollywood|journal54–65|url23 Feb 2010 | refNeve|first"Un-American" Hollywood: politics and film in the blacklist era |editorRutgers University Press|yearRed Hollywood in Transition: the Case of Robert Rossen | pages0-8135-4198-0 |urlNubM5xfHhoIC&pg%22Robert+Rossen%22+Director#v%22Robert%20Rossen%22%20Director&f23 Feb 2010 ***** -->
