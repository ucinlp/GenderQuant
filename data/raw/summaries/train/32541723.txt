Goofy is seen in a crowded office dreaming about his coming paid vacation. He plans "fishing at Fond du Lac, sunrise in the Rockies, basking on the beach, dude ranching, golfing, boating, and hunting in the North Woods." As soon as the clock strikes 12 noon, Goofy races outside the office building to his car and heads out on the highway. From this point the film follows a series of vignettes showing Goofy's many travel problems, all accompanied by sarcastic comments from the narrator. The first problem Goofy faces is getting stuck behind a slow-moving travel trailer which he can't seem to pass. The same trailer continues to follow Goofy, yet always remains one step ahead of him and causes most of his problems. Goofy is eventually able to pass the trailer, but is alarmed to see no one driving the car. He speeds away to avoid the car and trailer which is running out of control. Goofy is then arrested for speeding and is finally seen in jail, but happy for having found the "perfect haven for rest and relaxation."
