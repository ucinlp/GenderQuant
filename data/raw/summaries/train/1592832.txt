In the year 1840, a girl named Amiran  is kidnapped from her family in Faizabad, Oudh by their neighbour, Dilawar Khan , and sold to Madam Khanum Jaan  who owns a brothel in Lucknow where she trains courtesans . Amiran, renamed Umrao Jaan, learns to read, write, dance, sing, and charm wealthy men. She is a cultured woman trained to captivate men of wealth and taste. A grown-up Umrao Jaan  catches the eye of Nawab Sultan , and the two fall in love. But Nawab must marry to please his family, and Umrao's heart is broken. She meets a dashing bandit chieftain, Faiz Ali , who woos and wins her. She flees with her dacoit, hoping to marry him and leave the world of the courtesan far behind. But her lover is killed by local police and she is left alone, with no choice but to return to her old life. Soon, the British attack the city of Lucknow and the residents are forced to flee. Umrao's party of refugees stop in a small village near Lucknow. The residents ask the courtesan to sing and dance. Umrao, looking about her, realizes that this is her town, Faizabad, her family, the place from which she was kidnapped. She had been so young when kidnapped that she had forgotten, but now it all returns to her. She sings the song, "Yeh kya jagah hai doston?"  a veiled reference to her feelings of dismay at being treated like a pariah entertainer by her very own people. After, she meets her mother and younger brother, who had thought that she was dead. Her mother would be happy to welcome her back into the family, but her brother forbids it &mdash; she is tainted by her profession and must not return to embarrass them. At the end of the film, Umrao returns to the now-deserted and looted brothel in Lucknow and finds she is left alone, with nothing but her profession and her poetry.
