In the 1840s, an American sailor ashore in Liverpool is wrongly convicted and sent to the penal colony in Sydney Australia where he enters into a battle of wills with the Governor. The Governor offers him a pardon if he helps pioneer new land for the growing colony. He marries Irish woman Bess and they establish a far despite the harassment of bushrangers. Opponents of the governor persuade a visiting Crown commissioner, Lord Croydon, to revoke Adm's pardon. Adam tries to escape but is arrested. Bess pleads his case and Adam gets a full pardon.
