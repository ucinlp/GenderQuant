Eastern Plays is the story of two alienated brothers, Hristo or Itso , an artist woodcarver who is struggling with his methadone addiction, and Georgi , a high school student who is dragged into a neo-Nazi gang. The central point of the film is an ethnically-motivated attack by Georgi's neo-Nazi gang on a Turkish family from Istanbul, who are spending the night in Sofia en route to Germany. While Georgi initially participates in the beating, he is frightened and runs away. Itso, who had seen the family at a restaurant while he dined with his now-ex-girlfriend Niki , ends up intervening and saving the family, including the beautiful daughter Işıl . In his developing feelings for Işıl, Itso sees hope of a positive change in his destiny, while Georgi's actions and his brother's help make him question his philosophy and reconsider his outlook on life.{{cite news|url253023|titleНиколова|first2009-10-14|publisherBulgarian|accessdate"synopsis">{{cite web}}
