The Stooges are pest exterminators who decide to drum up business by planting mice, moths, and ants in an unsuspecting house. They select a fancy mansion where a high society dinner party is being held. After successfully infesting the house with pests, the trio are predictably hired to clean up their own mess without interrupting the party. One highlight is the piano recital, whereby Johann Strauss II's "Blue Danube Waltz" is being played by party guest/pianist Mr. Philander . A chorus of cats replies, bewildering the audience and Mr. Philander. Chaos ensues inside suddenly when a mouse enters the piano, agitating the cats. The Stooges are forced to get the offending pest off the piano, destroying it with hilarious results. After the piano incident passes, the Stooges start loitering around the pastry table. One things leads to another, and a massive pie fight ensues.
