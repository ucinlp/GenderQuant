Futile Attraction is about the filming of a reality dating show in which the main characters are so incompatible that the film crew have to manipulate and lie to them in order to keep them together. Randal  is a telemarketer with a passion for telephones who has never quite broken away from his controlling mother; Germaine  is an activist who agrees to be filmed in order to publicise the threat a new dam poses to her favourite stream. During the filming, presenter Dudley , who is willing to do anything to get himself looking good on camera, clashes with Anne , who prefers to ignore their boss's ever-changing scripting instructions in preference to a more objective look at the reality of the relationship.
