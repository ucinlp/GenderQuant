'Bobbie' Blake, , and Phillip Henderson, , are complete strangers, looking in a jewellery store window, when a hood known as “The Sparkler”, , sets them up to take the wrap, stashing some of the loot in their pockets, as the gang makes their getaway. No one believes that they’re innocent, not even their Public Defender. When they serve their time in the "The Joint", no one will give them a break, with their prison record, not even their own families; and, they can’t keep a job. Their landlady, Mrs. Abernathy, , likes them, and encourages them to get married. Despite the danger, Phil convinces Bobbi that their only chance is to see “The Sparkler”, and even the score.
