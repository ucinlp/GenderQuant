Following his fatherâ€™s death, Abdelwahad, a young man, has to take his place as head of the family. His presence is crucial to the family unit, especially as he has to provide for his seven brothers. Hlima, his mother and a woman of exemplary strength and nature, also fully plays her role. When Abdelwahad tells her that he wishes to leave to work in France, she tries to talk him out of it. He no longer can bear the life of young people in the countryside. He refuses to be a poor man without a future and applies for a work permit in France.
