Donald Campbell  is a sensitive teenage boy coming of age in a dark and uncertain time for both his community and life. His mother  wants him to continue his education after high school and become a priest, but Donald is more interested in girls than prayerbooks. After an unsuccessful attempt by a visiting priest to molest him, followed by his first sexual experience with a local girl, Donald politely informs his mother  that he is not going to be a priest. Meanwhile, when he is not in school, Donald spends his time helping his father  dig a Bootleg Pit; helps care for his older brother, Joe, who was the brightest boy in his grade until he got sick and was left disabled; and pursues Saxon Coldwell , one of police Sergeant Coldwell's two daughters. Sergeant Coldwell's wife died a few months earlier. Donald lives a hard-working but fairly happy life, until the night he witnesses Sergeant Coldwell shoot and kill the Jewish couple who are his landlord and landlady. The chief of police is a relative, so Donald feels comfortable admitting he saw the killing but he says he did not see who did it, because he is afraid of Sergeant Coldwell - especially after Sergeant Coldwell lets Donald know that he is aware that Donald did see who committed the murder . When the Sergeant comes home and finds Donald  visiting with his daughter Dianna, he snaps mentally and tries to kill the boy - with the result his secret is revealed and he is arrested. The film also depicts the daily lives of the eccentric locals and tight-knit families.
