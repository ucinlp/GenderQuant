Set in 19th century London, the story focuses on Sweeney Todd , a murderous barber/dentist whose business provides him with two profitable sidelines, the sale of his victims' jewelry and the disposal of their bodies to his mistress Mrs. Lovett , who uses them to prepare meat pies for her unsuspecting clientele. American Ben Carlyle  arrives in the city to track down wealthy diamond merchant Alfred Mannheim and $50,000 worth of jewels he had sold to Carlyle's employer but failed to deliver. Mannheim's staff advises Carlyle their boss disappeared without a trace weeks earlier, and he posts notices offering a reward for information leading to his discovery. Charlie , a mute orphan who works as an assistant to Todd, recognizes Mannheim as a man the barber shaved just prior to his disappearance. Realizing his dastardly deeds are in danger of being revealed, Todd imprisons the boy in his basement. Meanwhile, Carlyle is seeking the assistance of the corrupt local police and an amiable serving wench named Alice, who happens to be Todd's ward, with his quest. When his suspicions about the ingredients of Mrs. Lovett's pies are all but confirmed by a chemist, he hides himself in a burlap sack and has himself deposited in her pie shop cellar with a delivery of meat. There he makes a gruesome discovery that spurs him to confront Todd, who overpowers and binds him. As he prepares his instruments to torture Carlyle to death, he explains what led him to a life of murder and cannibalism. Charlie, who has managed to free himself from his shackles, stabs Todd in the back, killing him. He then frees Carlyle, who sets the building on fire before escaping with the boy.
