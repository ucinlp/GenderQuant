Gage Dobson is a young boy dealing with various problems in his life. He is constantly bullied at school , his mother, Cathy,  is dating the "creep" Dr. Elliot Carlisle , with whom Gage has a mutual hatred, and the girl he adores, Andrea , doesn't seem to know he exists. Gage's only friend is Professor Cruikshank , whom everyone considers a crackpot. After wandering into an abandoned mine, Gage calls itself Munchie . Gage runs home, frightened by the creature, only to find that Munchie has followed him home. Munchie explains to his new "pal" that he has magical powers and can help him out with the problems in his life. Munchie's "help," however, only causes Gage more trouble. Munchie helps him get revenge on the school bullies  but he also helps to embarrass the school principal, who threatens Gage with expulsion. Fed up with Munchie's machinations, Gage takes him to Cruikshank, who reveals that Munchie is an eternal creature that has been in every major civilization since time began. Gage leaves Munchie with Cruikshank, only to have Munchie return to his house and put together a huge party while Cathy and Dr. Carlisle are on a date. The party is a big hit; Gage's principal, who attends, tells him he won't have to worry about expulsion, and Andrea and Gage finally get a chance to talk and they hit it off well. While Cathy and Carlisle are on their date, Carlisle manages to disgust her with his misogynistic attitudes  and she demands he take her home early. They arrive and find the party in full swing. Cathy is furious with Gage, but when Carlisle finds a sleeping Munchie, he kidnaps him to take him to his office for experiments. With the help of Andrea and Cruikshank, Gage manages to get Munchie back and a chase ensues, culminating with Carlisle crashing into a donut shop and getting arrested by nearby cops. Munchie leaves to join Cruikshank on a foreign expedition, promising Gage that they'll see each other again someday.
