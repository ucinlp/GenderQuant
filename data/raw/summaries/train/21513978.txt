Newly married couple K. Krishnamurthy ([[Rajendra Prasad  works as an art director in Mumbai and his wife Satyabhama  as a stenographer in Kerala for a low salary. To solve their financial problems they seek a job in a big company and pretend to be unmarried as their boss  would give job only to one member in a family. This has slight resemblance to the 1955 classic movie Missamma where couples pretend to be married but here it's the other way around.
