Dr. Shooky Heftzibah’s dancing school is in large debts, and Heftzibah is looking for people he can convince to pay him large sums. He is reuniting with his long forgotten friend, the lazy garage owner and widower Ziggy Fuxman, and promising him to find him a new wife, if Fuxman pays Heftzibah’s debts. However, Heftzibah’s debts are so large that he has to look for a rich new wife for his friend. Heftzibah reads obituaries and takes Fuxman to a shiva in order to seduce the new widow, while Heftzibah and Fuxman pretend to be friends of the desist. Their deception is exposed. However, the widow, Gilah, is starts to date Fuxman. Meanwhile, Heftzibah finds another sucker, Ben-Gurion Shemesh, a gullible young worker of Fuxman who dreams of being a Disco dancing and singing star, and of marrying Fuxman’s daughter, Dinah, who does not like him. Heftzibah trains Shemesh and turns him into a big costumer. In order to keep impressing him, Heftzibah takes Shemesh behind the scenes of the opera to show him he knows important people in show business. Accidentally, Heftzibah and Shemesh find themselves dressed up as opera singers on the stage. Fuxman, who is sitting with Gilah in the audience and has just found out that Gilah is not rich, climbs on the stage too, dressed up as an opera singer, in order to take revenge at Heftzibah. After finding out that he can sing opera, Shemesh leaves Heftzibah, climbing the stage of a night club, giving an impressive performance and is gaining Dinah’s heart as well as a job for a pop producer. Fuxman, who had another groom in mind for his daughter, and Heftzibah, who has lost his customer, try to sabotage Shemesh’s first performance on T.V. like they sabotaged the opera show, but the audience likes the result and all three main characters are turned into stars.
