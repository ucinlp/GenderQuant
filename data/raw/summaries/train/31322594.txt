In a litte Sorbian village in East Germany, old farmer Krestan owns a little land and few animals, which he intends to inherit to his daughter Lena. When the government announces a plan to collectivize all the farms, Krestan is reluctant to hand over his property, and his neighbors share his sentiments. But when they realize the great advantages of collective ownership, they happily join in.
