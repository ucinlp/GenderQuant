A bullock cart rolled along the road. A full moon shone overhead. Sitting at the back of cart the villagers talked and sang happily. A journey was in progress. For Maguni, the driver of the cart it was the journey of his life. As he stirred the bullock cart along the road, he felt at peace with himself and his surroundings. But like the silky moon, which gives way to the bright sun, time eroded Maguni’s life. His bullock cart found itself out of fashion with the advent of more efficient and faster bus service. All of a sudden everybody preferred the new transport service to Maguni’s bullock cart. Trapped between necessity and freedom of spirit, Maguni chooses the latter at great cost. However, neither time nor the taunts of the villager break his spirit. Alone and hurt, Maguni continues his journey and at last his family, including his newly-married wife, are reduced to starvation. Starvation forces Maguni to part with his dear bullocks for survival. But the temporary respite fails to save Maguni and his eternal faith in human beings to crumble. Its finale shows an elegiac end with the death of Maguni and his wife.http://www.screenindia.com/old/archive/archive_fullstory.php?content_id=241
