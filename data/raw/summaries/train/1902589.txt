In 1953, Joe Morelli is traveling rural Sicily, offering to take screen tests of wannabe actors, for a fee. He claims to work for big Roman film studios, but he's a fraud. In one of his stops he meets a young girl, Beata, who attaches to him, despite his protestation. Their relation is evolving into a romantic one, when he's exposed, beaten and arrested. When, after serving his term, he comes back to seek Beata, he finds that the disappointment has been too big for her.
