EMS, the leader of the first ever democratically elected Communist Government is dead . Appa Mestry ([[Murali , a veteran Communist, who lives in the nostalgia of 'those great days', is unable to believe that EMS has died. For him EMS is a great leader, whose death is unthinkable. He goes back to those ages, where they worked for freedom struggle, risking their own lives. He proudly remembers the day which he took Comrade P. Krishnapilla on his shoulder across the river safely. He remembers contemptuously the day which the first EMS ministry was dismissed by the Central Government as a result of the unjust agitation by the religious lobbies of Kerala. He even had observed fast when AKG had gone on fast against a Government decision. Appa Mestry's next generation, his son-in-law ([[Vijayaraghavan  and his friend Bahuleyan , who have discarded their extremist leftist ideology, are illustrated as frauds. Here are some images that suggest they are fraudsters: Bahuleyan no more have his beard, which he had worn during his Communist days. He no longer uses bedis. According to Appa Mestry, his son-in-law has done wrong by not closing his office even after hearing about the death of EMS. They drive their car to get alcohol, even when entire Kerala grieves the death of EMS by observing harthal. Appa's grandchildren are indifferent and are immersed in their own worlds. During the television relay of the funeral procession of EMS, Appa's grandson sits watching a cricket match, completely oblivious of EMS's legacy. Appa Mestry dies broken hearted on the day of funeral of EMS.
