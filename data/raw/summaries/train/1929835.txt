The film tells the story of a little fox kit, Vic , who ventures away from his family's den and, upon his return, learns from his uncle Karak that his entire family has been shot and killed by a human hunter. Karak then offers for Vic to stay with him, and Karak continues to raise him. As Vic grows older, he develops much cunning and cleverness. Now a young adult fox, he finds a vixen, named Foxy, held captive in a cage on a human farm. He tricks the guard dogs and other animals, as well as the hunter himself, and eventually helps the vixen escape. She joins Vic and Karak in the woods, but Vic's uncle is shot by humans during a hunt. Vic swears revenge on the hunter and finally accomplishes it, playing many jokes on the hunter's stupid dogs, killing and devouring the man's chickens, geese, and ducks, and eventually playing tricks on the man himself. At the end of the film, Vic and his wife have cubs of their own.
