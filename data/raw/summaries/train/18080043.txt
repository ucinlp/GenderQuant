Shukichi Sugiyama  works in a bank in Tokyo. His eldest daughter Takako , with her toddler girl, is staying with him, running away from an unhappy marriage. Takako's younger sister Akiko  searches for her boyfriend Kenji in various locations. While looking for Kenji in a mahjong parlour, Akiko meets its proprietress Kikuko , who knows a lot about her family. Akiko meets Kenji and tells him she is pregnant. She arranges to meet Kenji in a cafe but he does not come, and she is picked up by the police. Takako pieces together that Kikuko is their long-lost mother and visits the parlour to ask Kikuko not to reveal to Akiko who she really is. Akiko has an abortion but does not tell Takako, borrowing the money from a family friend. Akiko learns that Takako visited the mahjong parlour. She works out that Kikuko is their mother, who ran away with another man when Akiko was still a toddler. Akiko suspects she is not her father's real daughter. She confronts Kikuko. Kikuko tells her that she is her father's daughter. She breaks into tears and leaves. She goes to a bar and then a restaurant and drinks heavily. Kenji appears and tries to apologize. Akiko hits him and runs out, and is hit by a train at an intersection just outside the restaurant. The restaurant owner stays with Akiko in the hospital. Shukichi and Takako arrive. Akiko says that she does not want to die, but start life over again. In the next scene, Takako visits Kikuko and tells her Akiko is dead, and blames Kikuko. Kikuko decides to leave Tokyo. She goes to the Sugiyamas to pay condolences but Takako does not let her in. Takako does not go to send her off at the railway station. Takako tells her father that she is going back to her husband to try to make their marriage work again because she does not want her daughter to become like Akiko. In the last scene, Shukichi leaves for work, with Takako not present.
