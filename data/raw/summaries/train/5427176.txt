Struggling and starving in Paris as an aspiring artist, Paul Sloane has had enough. He wants to return home to America to resume his relationship with his rich fiancee, Laurie. Best friend and roommate Casey Barnett tries to talk him out of it. When a beautiful woman, Nikki Donay, suddenly leaps into the river Seine to escape a man's attentions, Paul jumps in to save her. They make it to a barge, but Casey and everyone else are under the mistaken impression that neither survived. Casey gets an idea. A dead artist's paintings could now be very valuable, particularly considering the publicity given Paul's heroic attempt to save the damsel in distress. He begins selling Paul's work, but when the artist himself reappears, very much alive, they hatch a scheme. Paul will pretend to still be dead, while continuing to produce paintings for Casey to sell. Matters become further complicated when Laurie comes to Paris. Of all the women in all the world, Casey falls in love with her. This infuriates his best friend, resulting in Paul seeking revenge by slipping evidence to the police that Casey actually murdered him to profit from the art. Casey is tried, convicted and sentenced to death.
