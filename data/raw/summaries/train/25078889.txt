The Pilgrims land at Plymouth Rock and found a colony. A very large number of Pilgrims  can be seen standing in line... for their cigarette rations. A Pilgrim goes hunting for a turkey for Thanksgiving dinner. The turkey outsmarts the pilgrim many times and eventually the two make up and decide to eat at "Joe's restaurant" which is being advertised by a bear, at the end the bear has eaten the two and reveals that he is Joe and the two complain inside the bear's stomach. Many of the gags revolve around life on the home front in the United States during WWII, rationing and the black market. The turkey is a caricature of the comedian Jimmy Durante.
