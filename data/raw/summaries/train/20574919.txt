Disguising themselves as humans, a family of kumiho travel from their home in the mountains to the city. The kumiho can only truly become human if they consume a human liver during an eclipse that occurs once every thousand years, and with just thirty days to go they open a circus in the hope of attracting some victims. But the only person they succeed in capturing is conman Gi-dong, and things get complicated when the family's eldest daughter falls in love with him. In addition, a series of murders in the city brings the family under suspicion from a local police department.
