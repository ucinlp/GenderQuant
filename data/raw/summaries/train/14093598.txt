A young orphan boy Skeeter  is being raised in a swamp cabin by his poor and toothless Uncle Jesse . One night a mysterious noise breaks the silence. They later discover that the noise was caused by a strange breed of dog  unknown to them. Rather than a bark the dog has a yodel or laugh. The animal has keen senses and they decide to train her for bird hunting. In time the rightful owner  of the animal appears and due to the rarity of the breed wants it back. Skeeter is forced to "come of age" as it were and surrender the animal. With the reward money given, he is able to purchase Jesse the false teeth that he needs and is able to get himself a hunting rifle, remembering then that Lady is no longer with him.
