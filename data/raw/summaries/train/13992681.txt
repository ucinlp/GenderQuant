Police detective Dick Tracy  is brought in to investigate the fur thefts connected with murder with the assistance of his partner Pat Patton  as well as the flamboyant Vitamin Flintheart  and "Sightless" . This leads him to look into possible higher-ups who may have ordered the robbery. Tracy soon learns that the person behind it all is Steve Michel, a hook-wielding criminal who calls himself "The Claw." Before Tracy can unravel the bigger picture and the larger forces at work, the Claw dispatches more victims in a gruesome manner. Finally, when Tracy shows up to arrest him, the two engage in a high-speed chase. While on the run, the Claw electrocutes himself by plunging his hook into electrical wires while trying to kill Tracy.
