This episode takes place entirely on the countertop where Larry the Cucumber, Mr. Lunt and Pa Grape are hosting the show. Pa Grape informs the others that today they are going to do a little something else after all, but they resist. They laze around eating Chinese food while Pa Grape introduces the "Astonishing Contraption of Silliness". Pa Grape pushes them into action and they feed the votes into the Contraption, which sputters and begins presenting the Top 10 Silly Songs of All Time. The Contraption malfunctions halfway through the countdown, producing nonsense such as "The Dance of the Yodeling Cebu Lips" and "The Song of the Water-Buffalo who don't love Cebu with yodeling lips", forcing Larry and Mr. Lunt to come up with a song of their own. The result, based on the text of a Chinese takeout menu, is called "Do the Moo Shoo". Pa Grape declares that it won't make the Top Ten, and manages to fix the machine so the countdown can continue. When the countdown gets to the top two, The Contraption announces "The Pirates Who Don't...". But Pa Grape starts acting strange, suggests that all the votes have not been collected, and produces a big bag labeled "Official Votes" to feed into the machine. Larry and Mr. Lunt confront him and Pa finally confesses to trying to rig the election because "The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything" is the only song that features him. Larry and Mr. Lunt forgive him, saying that it's better than "The Forgive-O-Matic" from "God Wants Me to Forgive Them!?!", which was a failed attempt to sell a machine that supposedly gives automatic forgiveness. The final two songs are presented and the show ends with Larry, Pa Grape, and Mr Lunt singing "Silly Song Remix Medley" over the closing credits.
