In the midst of Japan's rising economy of the mid-1980s, the itinerant Tora-san becomes drunk with a hard-working company section chief. After an hour commute, the two sleep off their night's revelry at the section chief's home in Ibaraki Prefecture. When the section chief disappears due to the pressure of his job, Tora-san helps his wife to find the man, while secretly hoping they do not, as he has fallen in love with her.<ref name  http://www.kinejun.jp/cinema/id/17530|title2010-01-31|languageKinema Junpo}}<ref name Stuart |last Stuart Galbraith IV|urlTora-san 34: Tora-san's Forbidden Love  |date2010-01-31|publisher=DVD Talk}}
