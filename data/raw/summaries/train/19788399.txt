There are mainly two kinds of rock festivals: the usual ones and the adventurous-creative ones. The former present music, which everyone already knows. The others got their finger at the pulse of time and put their ear into niches and near boundary zones. They point out up-to-date trends, present upcoming musicians and bands, make new musical experiences and discoveries possible. The Klangbad festival at Scheer near Sigmaringen, South Germany, certainly belongs to this category and is the real festival insider's tip for open ears. The sleepy, pittoresque appearing village invites you to a musical provocative, avantgardistic-innovative journey, packed with surprises, crossing various genres. Far away from the nowadays usual chart monotony and the artistic mainstreams, international artists meet local bands, which indeed differ in style, popularity and stage experience, but comply anyhow in one concise criterion: The love to authentic, expressive music. Filmmakers Dietmar Post and Lucia Palacios in their film portrait the festival in the style of other Direct Cinema films, such as, Monterey Pop.
