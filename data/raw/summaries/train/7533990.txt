Set in a Nazi concentration camp, The Witness shows a series of repeating set of psychological actions. Gary Sinise plays a guard, whose daily routine is to corral Jewish prisoners through a tunnel and into the gas chamber. Each day, as he performs this task, the guard is watched by a Jewish little boy , whose piercing stare unsettles him. He tries to shake this child's steady glare, day after day, until one night he steals into the barracks, finds the child and smothers him. Instead of being free of the accusing stare, another child has replaced the one he killed. The Witness was produced in 1992 in the United States and is in the German language.
