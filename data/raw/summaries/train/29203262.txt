The film begins with Hanni  and his gangster colleagues who all work for Bhai Sahab , a gangster, watching U.S President Barack Obama's famous speech 'Yes We Can' on TV. Hunni is shown as a big fan of Obama and wants to migrate to the USA. In USA, Om Shastri , a business man has faced huge losses due to recession and is all set to lose his house if he can't pay his $100,000 loan in the next thirty days. He comes to India to sell his ancestral property in Uttar Pradesh as his last hope. But the recession has also hit India and he struggles to find a buyer. Hunni meets Om who promises him to take him to U.S. Hunni in excitement tells Bhai Sahab who thinks Om is rich and orders his kidnapping. He hopes to get a good ransom so that his bad times  end. Om is kidnapped but later tells Bhai Sahab and his men that he is bankrupt. Thanks to the local police, one of the local gangsters Ali comes to know about Om and orders Bhai Sahab to hand over to him. Hunni comes with idea of selling Om to Ali. Hunni, Bhai Sahab and his men chant 'Yes We Can' out of happiness. Om on hearing their conversation suggests Bhai Sahab and him share the money, in return he would not tell Ali about their cheating. The deal happens and Bhai Sahab gets Rs. 30 lakh . Bhai Sahab then transfers half the amount to Om's bank account in U.S. The other gangster comes to know about Om's bankruptcy. But Om saves his and Hunni's life by telling the same idea. The price now is Rs. 60 lakh  and divided equally. Om is then sold for Rs. 60 lakh  to Munni , a dread female gangster who hates men. Om is happy because he receives Rs. 30 lakh  and now there is a total of Rs. 45 lakh   in his bank account and tells his wife to pay off the loan. But soon Munni comes to know about Om's state and captures Bhai Sahab and his men. Om again saves his and others life from Munni asking her to play the same trick with local Minister and politician Dhanajay Singh. So Munni takes Om to Dhanajay Singh. The Minister runs a kidnapping Mafia and is the head of all kidnappings. Minister pays Munni Rs. 1.5 crore  and keeps Om and Hunni at his guest house. Om and Hunni come to know that they will be killed if Om's wife doesn't pay the ransom. At night, Om fakes a heart attack and escapes with Hunni. The Minister orders the police for a man hunt. Realizing that he cannot escape to Delhi, he comes with a new plan. He goes to the local police station where the Minister is there and surrenders to him. The minister is about to take Om back to the guest house when Hunni along with the Minister's supporters and local media arrive. The minister has no option but to release Om. Om on the other hand tells the media to project the Minister as the next Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh for saving his life. While on his way to Delhi to catch a flight back to U.S, Om is stopped by Bhai Sahab and Munni. Munni gives Om his share but Om tells her to give it to his relatives. Om leaves and Hunni stays back in India. In the last scene, Munni asks Bhai Sahab if they can be partners and he replies, "Yes, we can".
