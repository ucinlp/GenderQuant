A woman and man who met at a wedding reception decide to go on a date. He meets her at a railway station and they go for a picnic and a bike ride. They come to the outside of a cemetery and decide to go in. Once inside the huge cemetery, the woman becomes frightened. He calms her and persuades her to enter a crypt with him. A strange man watches the couple. The man and woman make love in the crypt. A clown places some flowers on a nearby grave and leaves. An old woman closes the cemetery gates. When the couple finally exit the crypt, night has fallen and they cannot find their way to the exit. They begin to panic. They discover a small building; inside are several child-sized coffins with small skeletons inside. The woman becomes hysterical, and exhibits bizarre behaviour and radical personality changes. She locks her lover in the crypt and he suffocates. Dawn finds the woman dancing around the cemetery, and later she re-enters the crypt. The old woman reopens the cemetery gates. Finding the crypt open, she seals the door and puts flowers on top of it.
