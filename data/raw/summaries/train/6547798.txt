German bombers are failing to make it to Moscow in World War II, so Hitler announces his decision via a radio broadcast to personally fly a heavy bomber to attack the Russians. On the way to Moscow, soviet gremlins sneak onto the plane in flight and without Hitler's knowledge, begin to dismantle it. They sing We Are Gremlins from the Kremlin to the tunes of the popular Russian songs Ochi Chyornye  and Eh, uchnem . Hitler eventually discovers the gremlins, and tries to retaliate. He fails, being severely frightened by several gremlins holding a mask of Joseph Stalin, and the gremlins succeed in disabling him and ejecting him from the bomber by cutting a hole in the fuselage beneath him. As he falls, Hitler comes to and realizes the plane is right behind him in a power dive. He tries to outrun the plane and to hide behind a small sapling upon landing, but the plane alters course as seen by its shadow and both Hitler and the plane are driven into the ground. The tail of the airplane with its swastika insignia erupts from the ground as a headstone. The short ends with the gremlins celebrating in victory as Hitler pops out of the ground with a paraphrased version of Lew Lehr's catch phrase, "Nazis is duh cwaziest peoples!" A gremlin pounds Hitler back into the ground with a sledgehammer, ending the film under Clampett's signature "bee-woop" vocalization.
