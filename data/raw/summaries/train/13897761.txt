The film begins with Franklin finishing up his time travel machine. He explains to his dog Blu that it works with the synthesis of the four elements. Just outside, Jimmy Five and Smudge concoct an "infallible plan" to steal Monica's blue toy rabbit, Samson. The plan eventually fails when Monica, while on a picnic with Maggy, discovers it. Jimmy Five and Smudge hide in Franklin's office. Monica and Maggy follow them there, where Monica accidentally throws her rabbit on Franklin's machine, causing the elements to travel to different periods in time. Franklin sends each child into a different time after the elements in order to bring them back. If they fail, time will slow down and eventually stop. Monica and Blu end up in Prehistoric times to recover the element of fire. Jimmy Five is sent to the 30th century to recover the element of air. Maggy is sent to a few years back  to recover the element of earth. Smudge is sent to an indigenous tribe in Colonial-era Brazil to recover water. The people they meet are all characters of other sister series of the original Monica's Gang comics , with exception of the villains "Bandeirante"  and "Cabeleira Negra" .
