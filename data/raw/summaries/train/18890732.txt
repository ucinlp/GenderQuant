Set in 1943 and 1944, the film is loosely based on actual events involving two of the most active fighters in the Holger Danske resistance group during World War II - Bent Faurschou-Hviid  and JÃ¸rgen Haagen Schmith , who both died toward the end of the war. As the two friends assassinate high-ranking Nazis and their Danish collaborators, they also find themselves in deadly duels with treacherous handlers, competing resistance groups, and a femme fatale  who might be a double  agent. Ultimately, they find that they can only trust one another.
