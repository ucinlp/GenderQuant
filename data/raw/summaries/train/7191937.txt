The film revolves around Krishna  who brings together an unlikely group of 5 youngsters to help in creating awareness among their villagers to revolt against the cruel village head, Rambhoopal  and his henchmen. Even though being a revolutionary theme, the movie was wonderfully made without the usual noise that accompanies the leftist movies and fashioned on the lines of the great epic Mahabharatham. Amazing performances by all the actors  and wonderful technical backup make this movie another classic from Bapu. The film also has Chiranjeevi as a very young actor  in the role of Parthu.
