An old sailor tells the legend of a starving polar bear  who attempted to steal food but kept running into a vicious guard dog. To placate the beast, the bear must sing "Rock-A-Bye Baby" to him to make him nod off which served as running gag. Unfortunately the dog wakes quickly at the slightest noise, and is cranky. The dog eventually chases the bear up a tall mountain. At the end of the picture the sailor says if you listen carefully you can to this day still hear the lullaby at night. Indeed, at the peak the pair stand—both very old and grey now—with the bear holding the dog tenderly and singing "Rock-A-Bye Baby".
