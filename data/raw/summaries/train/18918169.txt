The Commissioner informs The Inspector that the Blotch, a red blob of paint, is at large and plans to steal paintings from the Louvre. The Inspector and Sergeant Deux Deux go to investigate the case. The Blotch emerges from the floor and begins its theft. After picking the Inspector's pocket, it forms a door. The Inspector runs into it and falls. The Blotch goes away. The Inspector quickly jumps to his feet and runs after it. The Blotch paints the Inspector's back making it look like he is the Blotch causing Deux Deux to shoot him every time. In the end, the Blotch is successful and the Inspector and Deux Deux are left recreating over 4,000 stolen paintings.
