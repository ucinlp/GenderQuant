Stan and Ollie are two sailors on leave who happen upon two attractive girls strolling throughut a park. The sailors invite the ladies for a soda, but soon realize that they only have enough money for three people. Ollie spends an eternity trying to explain this fact to Stan, who cannot grasp that either he or Ollie will have to forgo a soda. Deperate, Stan deposits a coin in a slot machine in the soda shop and ends up hitting the jackpot. With excess money in hand, the boys rent a canoe with the ladies, which results in an all-out battle-royal with other boaters.
