Charlie Rockit's aunt and uncle are in danger of losing their farm because they need $50,000 to replace their tractor. To raise the money, Chuck E. Cheese and his friends decide to race in the Galaxy 5000 on the planet Orion . They face many challenges, including a racing vehicle that's practically junk, cheating competitors, and a woman named Astrid whom Chuck E. falls for but who's only interested in the prize money. Everything seems to go from bad to worse for Chuck E., but just when he's at his lowest point, he meets a hermit named Harry who gets him to believe in himself and helps him train for the race. During the race, Chuck E. overcomes the cheaters' maneuvers, getting stuck in a forest, and his own self-doubts to reach the finish line. After winning the price, Chuck E. and his friends head home.
