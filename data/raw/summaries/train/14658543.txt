The Crystal Cube is a science programme, based on shows such as Tomorrow's World. The show is hosted by Jackie Meld . In each episode, a different topic of science was to be discussed. In the pilot, it was genetics. Two guest scientists discussed the issue of genetics to a live studio audience and viewers at home. The scientists were Dr. Adrian Cowlacey , a practicing clinician at St. Thomas' Hospital, London, and Max Belhaven  of the Bastard Institute in California. Cowlacey and Belhaven comment positively on the prospects that in the future, society will be divided into a genetic caste system, with people divided into "Alphas", "Betas" and "Gammas" based on their genetic background . They also show an example of a genetically engineered human, Gareth Gamma 0001 , who is designed to carry out menial tasks without complaint. The show later goes into a debate between a member of clergy, The Bishop of Horley, The Very Reverend Previous Lockhort  and Martin Bealey , an anti-communist journalist who claims the Soviets are using genetics to invade Britain. However, Gareth interrupts the conversations and causes a riot. Cowlacey therefore ends the show.<ref nameThe Crystal Cube|series1|episode1983-07-07}}
