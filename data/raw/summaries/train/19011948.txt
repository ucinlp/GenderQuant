Among them is his angry girlfriend, Doris, and the suspicious women he encounters on his latest case. In a nightclub, the sultry Miss Dolan hires the private eye to follow her lover, Rick, who might be trying to kill her. The trail takes Harry to women like Mrs. King and Mrs. McGraw, who apparently are wed to the same man. A female investigator named Stella Wynkowski turns up. Harry teams up with her, never entirely certain whether she is friend or foe.
