The plot concerns the character of Mikko Syv√§rivi  who works as a night-watchman and also becomes an assistant at a Finnish Television Company. His first day at work starts out quite humorously as he is mistaken as a minister in the Finnish parliament by an urging reporter Antti Vasa  who takes him to a live TV-interview. Unfortunately due to the incident Vasa is demoted in to reporting on indifferent news-items with a minimal news-crew and often allowed to ask one question. Mikko on the other hand is also an urging writer who tries his luck comprising a comedy-show and even a police-drama. After catching Vasa breaking in to a store in the middle of the night  he decides to help Vasa with his reports eventually getting him back on the show where started out. Mikko also tries to impress a girl at the cafeteria and is even offered to stay at her  dormitory. At the latter half of the movie Vasa turns Mikko's bumbling in to a hit comedy-act which comprises him of injuring himself on various types of doors. The fame naturally gets to him in the end and ruins his relationship with the cafeteria girl. He also sabotages his own success by going on stage with a new gag which is met with a chilling silence as the audience leaves. Mikko then goes back to being just an assistant but seems content with the outcome by the end of the film.
