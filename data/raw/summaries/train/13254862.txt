Graham's life is full of promise. He has a just purchased a new house which he can now afford because he has landed a successful job. He is something of a suck up yuppie and his potential companion, Judy Dansig, is sex-crazed real estate agent. Unfortunately, his new home has unwanted guest. The ghost of a disgraced destitute shrink, who is carrying on playing mind games. When pieces of people Graham knew begin appearing in his fridge, the police blame him. Graham struggles to figure out what is going on. As the deaths continue he starts to even doubt his own sanity.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/vagrant/
