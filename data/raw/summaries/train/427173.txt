Members of a cult, modeled on Aum Shinrikyo, sabotage a city's water supply, then commit mass suicide near the shores of a lake. Family members  of the perpetrators meet at the lake to observe the anniversary of their loved ones' deaths. They meet a former member of the cult , who had trained for the water sabotage attack but defected at the last minute. He leads them to the cabin he's currently holed up in, where he and the deceased cult members had trained for the attack, and they pass the night reminiscing about those they'd known and lost, shown cinematically through improvised dialogues and flashbacks. Sakata, the aforementioned surviving cult and last to see most of the departed alive, and Atsushi  interrogate one another about YÃ»ko (played by actress/model [[Ryo , Atsushi's sister, whom Sakata had asked to run away with him the night before the attack.
