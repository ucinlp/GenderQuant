It's July 14th, and people are enjoying the national holiday. A group prepare what is later shown to be a warehouse robbery. Meanwhile, Laborie, a special agent in the French special forces, and an international team are escorting the leader of the Albanian mafia, Abedin Nexhepi. He is due to appear in a European court, charged with running an extensive prostitution network. Despite a considerable security presence, Nexhep's henchmen still try to intercept the armed escort. They set up an ambush, but the escort manages to escape. After a chase, the armed escort take refuge in a warehouse inside a massive industrial park. Upon arriving, they discover that the building is in the process of being robbed by a group of people after some computer equipment. While facing off against the would-be thieves, Nexhep's men surround the warehouse. The three groups are then involved in a long firefight, and everyone involved struggles to survive. Who exactly lives or dies is unclear right until the very end of the film.
