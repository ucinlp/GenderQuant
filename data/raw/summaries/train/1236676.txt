The film begins with a totally white screen and as the sun sets, the image of the Empire State Building emerges. The floodlights on its exterior come on, the building's lights flicker on and off for the next 6Â½ hours, then the floodlights go off again in the next to the last reel so that the remainder of the film takes place in nearly total darkness.{{cite book | last  Callie | year  The Films of Andy Warhol Part II | url  ASIN B0006P70ZM | page "NY Art">{{cite web}}
