Nora  is a young American woman of Irish origin who suffers from alcoholism. She and her husband Jim  are coming home from a night of drinking when Nora suffers an accident, tumbling down the stairs of their New York apartment building. Nora survives the fall, but is soon visited by headaches, nosebleeds and hallucinations. Determined to dry out for the sake of their young son, the couple head to Ireland where they pay a visit Nora's grandmother and Uncle Bill Ferriter  in their huge, labrynthinian mansion. Uncle Bill harbors a dark and fascinating secret in the basement: the perfectly preserved, mummified remains of a Druid witch; one of the "bog-men". It is revealed that this corpse is a distant ancestor of Nora's. Uncle Bill explains to her that the druid witch was neither good nor evil in her life, but more like a force of nature. However, the witch comes to life and attempts to steal the body, soul and identity of her hapless descendant.
