Amos Babcock Bellamy  and Ben Hucklebee  scheme to get their respective children, Luisa  and Matt , to fall in love. Knowing they will resist their fathers' interference, the two men use reverse psychology and fabricate a feud, building a wall between their houses and forbidding their children to speak to each other. When their plan works, they enlist the aid of El Gallo , the proprietor of a traveling carnival, to put an end to their supposed disagreement in a manner which will not reveal their deception. El Gallo pretends to kidnap Luisa with the help of his troupe, which includes elderly Shakespearean actor Henry Albertson  and his mute sidekick Mortimer ([[Teller , and arranges for Matt to rescue her. The couple settles into what they anticipate will be domestic bliss, but through the eyes of El Gallo and company they see the harsh realities of the world, and their innocent romanticism is replaced by a more mature understanding of love.
