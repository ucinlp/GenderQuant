At an American air base in England in 1943, conniving, womanizing Sergeant Dolan  gives his commanding officer and close friend, Colonel Brickley , headaches by ignoring the out-of-date rules of engagement formulated by Brigadier General M. Gilbert . When Major General Mike McCready  promotes Brickley to whip a new squadron into shape, Brickley recommends Hardin as his replacement. Despite his misgivings, McCready agrees. To everyone's surprise, Hardin strictly enforces the rules. One in particular, forbidding pilots to marry, irks his friend and wingman Captain Stu Hamilton . As a result, when his tour of duty ends, Hamilton does not sign up for another one, instead going home to marry his sweetheart. However, he returns, hoping to persuade Hardin to overlook his transgression. Hardin refuses to let him back into the squadron, but does weaken enough to let him fly one last mission. Unfortunately, Hamilton is shot down and killed; he admits to Hardin over the radio as his plane plummets to the ground that he was distracted by thoughts of his wife. McCready decides that he needs Hardin for his staff, but allows Hardin to finish his tour first. His next mission is providing close air support for the Allied landings on D-Day. His plane is hit by flak and crashes.
