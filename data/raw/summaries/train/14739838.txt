The Stooges are repairmen who are on trial for stealing chickens, but are found not guilty. However, Shemp opens his suit jacket, resulting in a live chicken flying out of his grip and into the face of Judge Henderson . The boys then flee the courtroom, and pursue some work.  The trio comes upon a lady customer  whose doorbell is in need of repair. The Stooges manage to ruin most of the house while working on the wiring, ultimately clobbering the chef  who is preparing dinner at the customer's house. The irate chef abruptly quits, resulting in the Stooges being hired to prepare dinner for her husband's birthday party. To their shock and horror, the party in question is for none other than Judge Henderson, and their lady customer is the Judge's wife. Now frantic, the trio try their best to make the dinner at least partially edible. All hell nearly breaks loose when the birthday cake they prepare is accidentally pierced, deflating in the process. The cake is then "re-inflated" using town gas through the gas stove's connection. During the party, Judge Henderson blows out the candles, and the gas-filled cake explodes. The judge angrily realizes who the new "help" are, and the Stooges are forced to leave in a hurry.
