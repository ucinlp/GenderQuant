Steve Taggart is a Los Angeles sports writer who becomes obsessed with gambling. He volunteers to do a series of articles for the newspaper on a compulsive gambler he calls "Mr. Green," who is, in fact, himself. Taggart gets deeper and deeper into debt, compounding his problems with associated loan sharks, including the dangerous Dutchman. The complications spill over into Taggart's personal life, as when he brings his daughter to the racetrack and is physically assaulted by a bookie to whom he owes money. Taggart's newspaper editor ([[John Saxon  loves the series he's been running and has been advancing the writer considerable money, still unaware that Taggart is actually the risk-addicted Mr. Green. Taggart goes to Gamblers Anonymous to try to get straight, also becoming acquainted with Las Vegas high-roller Charley Peru to try to get even and also get the Dutchman off his back. To celebrate kicking his gambling habit, Taggart goes right back to the dice tables, where his solution to getting out of debt turns out to be continuing to gamble until he can win all the money he needs.
