One of her few comforts is her love for barker Joe Palmer ([[Donald Cook . He, however, seems less enthused about the relationship and regularly takes money from her. To add to her troubles, her younger sister Irene , whom she is having educated to become a lady, visits her during school vacation and wants to stay with the circus. Irene and Tom fall in love.
