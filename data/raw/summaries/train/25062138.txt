One manâ€™s broken relationship with his son fills him with the desire to give the young boys in his town hope and confidence. He seeks to accomplish this by forming a baseball team to involve both fathers and sons in it. Without knowing it, his actions will also bless and bring a new meaning in life to the father of one of the boys, a man serving a life sentence in the local penitentiary. The townspeople are powerfully changed as fathers reunite with their sons and realize their own ability to be one good man.
