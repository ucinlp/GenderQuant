In colonial Australia, James Morrison is a young teamster who has two friends, Long and Short. He is betrothed to Jane Judd when he visits Sydney and meets fiery Irish girl Biddy O'Shea, who is just off the "wife ship" - a boatload of women from an Irish orphanage bought out to Australia. James is attracted to Biddy and promises to marry her. James returns to Bathurst to break the news to Jane, but his mother dies and makes James promise to marry her daughter. He feels obliged to honour his old commitment to Jane. Biddy hears of the news and marries an ex-convict, James Parry, who she does not love. They start a farm and have a baby son together, Jack. James later comes across a homestead being attacked by aboriginals and discovers Biddy mortally wounded, and her husband dead - but her baby is still alive. James raises the baby as his own. Frank Parry grows up as brother with Tom, the son of James and Jane. In the 1930s Frank Morrison battles to save his outback station. He falls in love with Biddy Parry.
