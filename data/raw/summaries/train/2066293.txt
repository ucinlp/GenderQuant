Uncouth tycoon Harry Brock  goes to Washington, D.C. with his brassy mistress, Emma 'Billie' Dawn , and his crooked lawyer, Jim Devery , to "influence" a politician or two. The lawyer also presses Harry to marry Billie on the grounds that a wife cannot testify against her husband. Harry becomes disgusted with Billie's ignorance and lack of manners  and hires a tutor for her, journalist Paul Verrall . Blossoming under Paul's encouragement, Billie turns out to be much smarter than anybody knew and begins thinking for herself. The two fall in love. Meanwhile, Devery had persuaded Harry to sign over many of his assets to Billie to hide them from the government. When Harry needs to get them back, he comes into conflict with Billie's new-found independence. She and Paul use her leverage to escape from Harry's domination; she promises to give him back his property little by little as long as he leaves them alone. Billie and Paul marry.
