Kung  is the spoiled youngest brother of three: no job, no education, plenty of money, plenty of girlfriends, and a good home, whom he shares with the two brothers Lo Leung and Fei, his sister-in-law , and his wise father, Mr. Lo. On his upcoming birthday, as a cruel but well-executed prank, Leung and Fei will feign a lottery win worth $30 million using a useless ticket and a recorded tape bearing the lottery pick from a previous night, all as Kung's birthday present. Excessive greed causes Kung to fall for it, and he immediately  goes out with a selected girlfriend, Gigi, and hits it off at a night club. Instead he runs afoul of Triad member Brother Smartie, who wants a game of dice. Kung easily loses $1 million, as well as $5000 to Gigi, and he relies on his "winnings" in order to pay it all back. When he finally discovers he never won the lottery , he decides to fake being mentally retarded, a feat which he pulls off quite well. Then he learns he gains more benefits that way, so he chooses to remain mentally ill for the time being. However, he has to learn the true meaning of life and to take what life has to offer but not ask for more.
