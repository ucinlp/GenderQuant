The situation is that of a group of people on a British mystery tour , focusing mostly on Mr. Richard Starkey  and his recently widowed Auntie Jessie . Other group members on the bus include the tour director Jolly Jimmy Johnson , the tour hostess Miss Wendy Winters , conductor Buster Bloodvessel , and the other Beatles. During the course of the tour, "strange things begin to happen" at the whim of "four or five magicians", four of whom are played by The Beatles themselves and the fifth by long-time road manager Mal Evans. During the journey, Ringo and his Auntie Jessie argue continually. During the tour, Aunt Jessie begins to have daydreams of falling in love with Buster Bloodvessel, who displays increasingly eccentric and disturbing behaviour. The tour involves several strange activities, such as an impromptu race in which each tour group member employs a different mode of transportation . There is a strange scene where the group walks through what appears to be a British Army recruitment office and are greeted by the army drill sergeant  . The sergeant, shouting incomprehensibly, appears to instruct the assembled onlookers on how to attack a stuffed cow. The entire tour group also crawls into a tiny tent in a field, inside which is a projection theatre. The film continues with the men of the tour group watching a strip show , and ends with an old-style dance scene to "Your Mother Should Know". The film is punctuated by musical interludes, which include The Beatles performing "I Am the Walrus" wearing animal masks, George Harrison singing "Blue Jay Way" while waiting on Blue Jay Way Road, and the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band performing Vivian Stanshall and Neil Innes's "Death Cab For Cutie", sung by Stanshall.
