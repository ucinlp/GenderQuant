7 Hati follows the story of seven women who are unknowingly interconnected. The lead character, Kartini , is a 45-year-old obstetrician who finds herself increasingly sympathetic with her patients. These patients include Ratna , a hijab-wearing woman who is pregnant for the first time; Rara , Ratna's 14-year-old sister; Yanti , a prostitute; Lili , a pregnant Chinese Indonesian woman; and Lastri , an obese woman. Each character has their own problems, which they confide to Kartini about. Ratna is overworked and has to support her family, without the help of her materialistic husband. Rara is worried that she may be pregnant after having sexual intercourse with her boyfriend. Yanti suffers from cervical cancer. Lili has been sexually abused by her husband, but thinks of it as an indication of his love. Lastri is newly-married and trying to get pregnant. Kartini herself has had bad experiences in her former relationships, making her afraid of commitment.
