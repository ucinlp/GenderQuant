Two undercover detectives, Numata and Tosaka, infiltrate a plastic covered den where they discover a gang of organ thieves led by the teacher Saeki and his one-eyed sister Yoko who are cutting open a victim who is still alive. After a gun battle ensues, Tosaka is captured and Numata escapes. Saeki works at a girls' school where he offers private lessons to teens whom he later harvests for organs. We learn later that Saeki's mother bit off his genitals when he was young and, like his victims, Saeki is now rotting away.
