Naive fourteen-year-old Edith  and her Jewish parents are sent to a concentration camp, where the latter are killed. Sofia , an older, political prisoner, and a kindly camp doctor save her from a similar fate by giving her a new, non-Jewish identity, that of the newly dead Nichole Niepas. As time goes by, she becomes more hardened to the brutal life. She first sells her body to a German guard in return for food; she becomes fond of another guard, Karl . The fraternization helps her become a kapo, one of those put in charge of the other prisoners. She thrives while the idealistic Sofia grows steadily weaker. When she falls in love with Sascha , a Russian prisoner of war, Edith is persuaded to play a crucial role in a mass escape, turning off the power. Most of the would-be escapees are killed, but some get away. Edith is not one of them. As she lies dying, she tells Karl, "They screwed us over, Karl, they screwed us both over."
