Peter, a hairdresser, meets June, a hospital nurse, at the discoth√®que one night and she becomes his girlfriend. She claims to have a spiritual "third eye" which allows her to see ghosts. Peter and June develop a close bond, but Peter begins to encounter increasingly bizarre incidents of people being possessed by ghosts and dying. June insists Peter call her "Siu-kam" one day and develops a close friendship with a boy in the neighborhood. When Peter and June visit the boy's family he realizes that his mother was under attack by two vicious spirits who are vying for the mother's body, one of whom is looking for his head. Later the boy's dead body is found at the foot of the flat. Peter's father commits suicide in the hospital under strange circumstances and a nurse claims she saw June and Peter's father staring at each other for minutes before the latter's death. Peter becomes suspicious of June and wants to break up with her, even when she tries to warn him that he is targeted by the "headless ghost". When Peter's best friend Simon tells him that he was indeed possessed, Peter regains trust in June and starts unraveling the mystery by tracking down details of a horrific accident happening at Sai Wan two decades ago. Apparently, Peter's father had accidentally caused a man to be decapitated by a tram decades ago, and his ghost is seeking revenge on him and his son.
