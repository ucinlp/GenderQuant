A deranged man calling himself James Pettis  approaches the Grand Rapids Press demanding that it publish his predictions about the upcoming demise of civilization due to the conditions of global warming, warning that he has trapped a group of six people in a Turkish-style steamroom to demonstrate the effects of this environment on humans.A local police detective Mancini  tries to get Pettis to reveal information that will help him confirm the truth of his story, and to rescue the hostages, but over the course of the interrogation begins to suspect that either Pettis' story is a delusional hoax, or that the steamroom killing has already taken place. As Pettis describes developments in the streamroom to Mancini, the scene is shown of three men and three women meeting in the steamroom of a luxury hotel as part of an online dating promotion, then being locked in there together. When they discover that they have been locked in, they react badly: Frank  becomes abusive to Jessie , and is killed in her defense by openly neurotic Margaret . Jessie is killed with a nail gun by an unseen assailant when she pokes her head through the small window in the steamroom door; Christopher  is injured in the hand with a nail as the window is boarded over from outside. Margaret becomes agitated and commits suicide. Grant  is bludgeoned by Catherine  after he accuses her and Christopher of being allies of the perpetrators, and repeatedly holds her head underwater. Mancini's call to Pettis' psychiatrist finally brings staff from the local state psychiatric hospital, from which Pettis recently escaped. It is revealed that Christopher and Catherine are staff at this facility, and are unhappy with Pettis for going to the news media and police with this story.
