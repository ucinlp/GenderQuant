Goofy is setting up an animal trap while Donald is in an igloo preparing a meal. Donald explains how sick he is of eating beans all the time, and, while noticing a penguin outside, he hatches a plan to have a tasty penguin buffet. The rest of the cartoon deals with him trying to lure a large group into his pot while Goofy is stuck trying desperately to catch a walrus. The name of Donald's and Goofy's trapping business is "Donald & Goofy Trapping Co". Their slogan is "We Bring 'Em Back Alive". This is Donald's first time encountering penguins, but it is not his last. The music played while Donald leads the penguins is the instrumental piece "March of the Toys", from the operetta "Babes in Toyland", also known as Parade Of The Tin Soldiers.
