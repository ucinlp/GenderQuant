Albuquerque, New Mexico, 1951. Sid Silver  has a problem: his social guidance films aren't working anymore. The teens of the '50s are going crazy buck wild and Sid can no longer reach them. Clay Crawford  also has a problem. He's on the run from the law and trying to make it to California to find a man who may be his father. A grizzled bounty hunter named Lucky  is hot on Clay's trail. Sid and Clay cross paths in the hot desert winds of New Mexico. Sid's daughter Anne-Marie  begins to fall for Clay to the dismay of her fianc√©, Ted  who also bankrolls Sid's films. The fates of Formosa Studios and perhaps New Mexico itself hang in the balance.
