Taking advantage of the fame of Los Chicos in Puerto Rico and Central America, and after the relative success of the movie Una Aventura Llamada Menudo, producer and director Orestes Trucco wrote a script for the movie aimed at the pre-teen and teen markets. Puerto Rican actors Juan Manuel Lebrón and Otilio Warrington starred as members of a mafia-type organization in charge of the so-called Conexión Caribe . Movie starts at a concert location for Los Chicos where Migue, the oldest member of the band, was kidnapped prior to the show. This opportunity is used to introduce the new member of the band, Alex Rodríguez. After the concert, the band received a call to attend a port in Fajardo to rescue Migue. The members of the band escape police protection and they make their way to the port, where Migue is safely in a boat with a group of girls and ready for a vacation trip around the Caribbean. However, the owner and captain of the boat is also member of the plot, which eventually ends in another kidnap, a visit to Casa de Campo in Dominican Republic and the eventual return to a deluxe hotel in San Juan, where the secret operation is revealed: it was only a ploy to bring Los Chicos to Don Padrone's  daughter 15th year birthday party. A special participation by Sandra Zaiter, spokesperson for Society of Handicapped Children and Adults, ends the movie with a diving exhibition by Los Chicos in the an olympic pool.
