When a high profile Senator  boards a train at Union Station, he is expecting a smooth ride. However, his trip is interrupted when a militia group hijacks the train, taking him and several other passengers hostage and planting a nuclear bomb somewhere on board. An ATF Agent  who happened to be a passenger on the train is the one man who just may be able of both freeing the hostages and defusing the bomb before time runs out.
