The story is set in the year 2036 and revolves around a special forces team led by Major Agatha Doyle  formed, similarly to that of The Dirty Dozen, from death-row prisoners and their ensuing mission. Captain Aldrich is a former war hero convicted and on death row who is offered the chance at a pardon if he will join the team and undertake their mission to infiltrate an enemy facility. Once they have gained access to the base they are confused by the apparent lack of resistance and upon further inspection they find their enemies bodies piled up in a storeroom. Their state of mind is weakened when they are attacked and some of them are killed without seeing the perpetrator. After finding a computer disk holding information they listen to the account given by the enemy team commander about how events unfolded leading to their enemies demise. Finally it dawns on them that the unknown killer that picked their enemies off one by one is now stalking them. The surviving members of Doyle's team have to try to destroy the demon enemy before it destroys them.
