The film follows Emma Donne, who is left with nothing after witnessing the shooting and abduction of her husband. Lacking family and friends, she immerses herself in the only thing she has left: her work. As an operator at a paging company, Emma is a modern day messenger. She begins to find solace by living vicariously through the message she relays... and what once was a dreadful chore becomes an obsession for her. Methodically, Emma retreats from the world around her and starts to substitute her basic need for human contact with these meaningless and impersonal messages. After months without a clue about her husband's disappearance, Emma starts receiving personal and intimate messages that only her husband could write. With nothing to lose but her life, Emma gets involved and follows the lead of the mystifying messages. Caught in an ever-widening web of lies and strange coincidences, Emma realizes that events are not always what they seem, as dark secrets about her previous "perfect" life begin to surface. The film had a theatrical premiere in Puerto Rico in November 1999.
