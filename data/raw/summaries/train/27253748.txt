Sivankutty ([[Dileep  is a big fan of Super star Mohanlal. A part-time mechanic, Sivankutty ekes out a living selling tickets of Mohanlal films in the black. It is at this stage that comely Karishma  walks into his life. Karishma is an engineering student who happens to be staying in a hostel near Sivankutty's house. In no time, Sivankutty is bowled over by Karishma's curls and charms. But Sivankutty's friend Thanki  is in silent love with him too. Sivankutty is unaware of Thanki's feelings for him. Later, a local dada, Bhaskaran  kills a policeman and ends up in jail. Beside herself with grief, the policeman's mother goes mad. Since Bhaskaran was a terror in the village, no one is ready to testify against him. But the pitiable plight of the old woman moves Sivankutty, who musters courage to give evidence against the toughie. A pep talk by the local inspector Kapil Dev  also gives Sivankutty the courage to take on the dada. The daring deed makes him a hero in the village. Soon Sivankutty learns to his horror that Bhaskaran is out on parole. The 'hero' develops cold feet. What follows is the climax featuring a burly Bhaskaran and scared-out-of-his-wits Sivankutty.
