Conceptual artist Anne Benton  creates electronic pieces that flash glib but superficially significant statements, and her work has begun to attract major media attention. Driving home one night, Anne suffers a blowout on a deserted road and, while looking for help, witnesses a mafia hit supervised by Leo Carelli . Leo spots Anne, but she escapes and goes to the police. They offer her a place in the federal witness protection program, but mob boss Lino Avoca , Carelli's boss, sends top-of-the-line hitman Milo  and his partner Pinella  to silence her. Pinella kills her boyfriend Bob , but she escapes. Months pass; Anne has severed all ties with her past and re-established herself in Seattle as an advertising copywriter. Milo, who never gives up, recognizes the text of a lipstick ad as one of Anne's catchphrases, and tracks her down. She flees again, to New Mexico, and he finds her again. But this time he offers her a deal: he'll let her live, if she'll do anything and everything he asks. Milo's interest in Anne, it turns out, is more than professional, but not exactly what she thinks. He doesn't want her to be his sex slave, though sex is part of the equation. A man obsessed, Milo has fallen in love with Anne. And he has no idea how to cope with the unfamiliar emotion. Astonishingly, after a rocky start, Anne realizes that she has also fallen for him. By failing to kill Anne as he was hired to do, Milo has marked himself for death, and the two flee together to an isolated farm that Milo owns. Avoca's men track them there, and they realize that in order to be free, they must return and confront their pursuers. The plan that they concoct works, leaving Avoca, Carelli, and their men dead. Anne and Milo escape together to a new life.
