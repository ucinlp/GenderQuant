Tully was a prosperous town in tropical north Queensland, until Brazil dumped its sugar surplus on the global market. The locals call a meeting to save the town from financial disaster. Ron Hunt stands up and proposes to build The World’s Biggest Gumboot in honour of Tully’s rainfall record of 7.98 metres in 1950. Ron declares the Big Golden Gumboot will put Tully on the map, so he and the local Rotary Club hire out-of-towner Bryan Newell to build the edifice. Tully's local artist and fellow Rotarian. Roger Chandler is not pleased. The cost of the boot blows out to $90,000, and the construction is endlessly delayed by rain. Personalities clash, and Ron wonders whether he has made the right decision. Dispersed throughout the main narrative are small vignettes highlighting other Big Things around Australia.
