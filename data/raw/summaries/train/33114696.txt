A newspaper journalist, Stanley Lane , discovers a German spy ring in Sydney led by Carl Hoffman (Charles Villiers}. Lane is captured and imprisoned by Germans on an uncharted Pacific Island. With the help of half-caste Samoan girl Kana  he escapes and destroys a German wireless station in Samoa. He is re-captured and tied to a tree in a crocodile-infested swamp, but Kana saves him again. Later the HMAS Sydney invades the island and Hoffman runs into the swamp and is eaten by crocodiles.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900â€“1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, p 55
