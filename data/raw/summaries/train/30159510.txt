The film is a tale about a small band of contumacious boys and girls that live in a hidden village on a faraway beach; they are the Ivory Rebellion, a feral group of children that are fighting from oppression against an evil queen named Johanna, and her ruthless Onyx Empire. Like Peter Pan & The Lost Boys, the rebels have shunned society and live completely free of parents and authority figures. They're existence, albeit a simple one, is entirely devoid of technology, minus simple firearms and an ancient tube radio. Surrounding their beach is a border, the land across from which is forbidden and belongs to the Onyx Empire. For the longest time a treaty was set forth, stating that no one from either side shall cross said border, but in a last-ditch effort to induct the boys and girls of the Ivory Rebellion, Queen Johanna has halted all supply shipments into their village. The rebels are running low on food, and with the threat of starvation, are forced to make a decision that could cost them everything.
