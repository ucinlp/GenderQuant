Kailash Nath is the manager of a bank who lives a comfortable lifestyle with his wife, Savitri, and son, Kishan. He is friendly with the Bank Watchman, Shankar Dayal Khurana, so much so that he arranges the engagement of Kishan with Shankar's daughter, Sanam. Shortly after the engagement, the bank is robbed. Kailash becomes a suspect, is arrested, charged, and sentenced to 12 years in prison. After he completes his sentence he returns home to find that Savitri and Kishan are not traceable. He also finds out that he was framed for the bank robbery by none other than Shankar, who is now the Mayor of this town. In the meantime, Kishan, now grown up, goes to take Sanam home with him as his bride. When she refuses to do so, he forcibly takes her. Kishan is not aware that Sanam is to be married to Pradeep, the only son of millionaire Lalla. Sanam intends to publicly humiliate Kishan and Savitri prior to her marriage with Pradeep due to their poverty.
