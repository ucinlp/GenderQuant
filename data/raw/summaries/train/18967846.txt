Ann  is a young girl who has been living in an orphanage since infancy. She is disliked and spurned by the other children, and treated coldly by the orphanage administratorsâ€”the reason for this, however, is unclear.

One day, while the children are napping, a fire breaks out in the orphanage and Ann heroically saves Goldie from the flames.Hoodoo Ann at Yahoo!
