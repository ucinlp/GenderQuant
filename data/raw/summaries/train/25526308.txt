Michelle Rosen is a poor girl who is the 'new kid' at her high school. Jealous of the popular cliques, she spends her lunch reading under a tree when approached by the handsome football star, Aaron, who invites her to a party. Aaron's ex-girlfriend, Debbie, a member of the popular clique makes up rumors about Michelle. At the party Aaron slips Michelle a roofie, and gang rapes her with his friends. The rapists' girlfriends then assume that Michelle seduced them, duct tapes her to a tree, and writes "slut" on her forehead. Later at school, Michelle finds posters all over the hallways stating "Michelle Rosen is a slut". She then gets her revenge with a series of bloody murders.
