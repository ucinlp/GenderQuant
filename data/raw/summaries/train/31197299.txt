Bill  and Kate  are a married couple who are tightly wound and devoted to their work -- Bill is a businessman, Kate proofreads books. Bill and Kate's marriage has taken a turn for the worse, and they're on the verge of breaking up when they receive shocking news -- their 18-year-old son Sam , a college freshman, went on a shooting spree that claimed the lives of 21 people before he turned his gun on himself. As the news media descends on the couple, Bill and Kate are unable to understand why Sam would do such a thing, and as they struggle to find answers, they turn to family -- Kate's brother Eric  and his wife Trish  -- without being able to resolve the issues that were driving them apart before tragedy struck.
