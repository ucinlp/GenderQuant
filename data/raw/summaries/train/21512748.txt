An old artisan in a middle-eastern town finds himself the brunt of abuse from the townspeople, due to his hunch-back. The children, who call him "wicked", chase him and corner him in his shop. He locks them in, and tells them they can only leave once they have listened to his story. It turns out the old man used to be called "little Muck" in his youth. As a boy, Muck is kind and benevolent, despite being discriminated against by everyone. When his caring father dies, his greedy relatives ransack his house and threaten Muck. Muck escapes, and sets out in search of a merchant who can supposedly sell happiness. Muck wanders across the desert, only to find the house of a wicked woman who traps him. Before escaping, he takes her magical boots and staff. These boots allow Muck to run faster than anyone else in the land. He immediately seeks out the Sultan, and with the help of his boots, he becomes the Sultan's chief runner, delivering messages. His staff also has the power to find buried treasure. His employment with the sultan leads to the youth encountering some ethical problems. Eventually, he is framed for thievery, and thrown out. Despite these circumstances, Muck returns, and helps his virtuous friend Hassan win the heart of the lovely Princess Amarza. Once Muck has finished his retrospective, the children display a newfound respect for him, and they help him with his work.
