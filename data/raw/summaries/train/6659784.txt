Dr. Jonas Carson  creates an android that looks just like a human 17-year-old boy, and he "adopts" him as his son and as an older brother to Becky , who names him Chip. After the Carsons move to a new town, Chip  is enrolled in high school alongside Becky. Dr. Carson also begins teaching science at the school, so he can keep a close watch over his son's progress. Dr. Carson's former employer, Gordon Vogel , seeks to apprehend Carson's functional android, believing that he is entitled to this advanced technology since it was developed while Carson was under a contract that he didn't fulfill. Vogel has plans to turn Chip into a war-machine military project.
