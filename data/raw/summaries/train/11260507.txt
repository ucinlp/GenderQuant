Five college students, namely Vicky, Ayesha, Roxy, Simon, and O.J. are on their way to a concert. While in Hell's Ground they make a brief stop so O.J. could throw up near a river after eating spoiled Laddus. While he is vomiting he is bit in the leg by an unknown man. After crying for help and escaping his attacker he rendezvous with his group and they decide to move on. However, they haven't driven too far when they run into a crowd of zombies in the woods, who has turned into the undead presumably because of the contamination in their local water. The group narrowly manages to escape. Later, when the group feels lost, they are left with no choice but to seek help from the local natives living in the isolation of the Jungle. Upon exploration, a strange man dressed in a robe and representing the attire of that of a Fakir agrees to help them. However, after witnessing his strange and obnoxious behavior the group decides to force the man out of the car. When he barricades the car with his body, Vicky drives over him, crushing his body. Eventually the rented van is out of gas, and Vicky decides to get help from a nearby house. Little did he know that the house was being used as a trap to lure visitors so they could be killed and butchered into pieces by a strange character wearing a Burqa. From that point the plot unfolds to reveal the fate of each character.
