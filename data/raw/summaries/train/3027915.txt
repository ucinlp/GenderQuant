The narrator describes that a lost episode of SpongeBob SquarePants was discovered "under a desk at Nickelodeon Studios" and is to be presented by Patchy the Pirate. However, Patchy says that he has lost the lost episode, and tells the audience to forget about SpongeBob. The narrator introduces a segment called "Remembering SpongeBob", a musical montage of clips from past episodes from seasons 1-3. Eventually Patchy finds a treasure map to the lost episode and after searching for it, he excitedly starts the tape. The tape shows a long clip of SpongeBob doing walk cycles down the road to upbeat music before abruptly showing the EBS color bars. After Patchy sees this he gets furious, throws out all his SpongeBob merchandise, and runs away. However, Potty informs him that the real lost episode is playing next. Patchy comes back and rewinds his actions. In the episode, SpongeBob wishes he could fly with the jellyfish. He makes several failed attempts to do so, including a biplane, bat wings, a garden chair with balloons, and a giant kite pulled by a bicycle, and is ridiculed by the others. He tells the people that "it is a sad day in Bikini Bottom, when a guy is ridiculed for having dreams!" The people tell him that they all had unfulfilled dreams, and start chasing him for thinking he is more important than them. SpongeBob runs off a cliff and falls into a truck of mud, then into a truck of feathers. Back home, having given up on his dream, SpongeBob dries himself out when he receives an insulting phone call and puts the hair dryer in his pants. While he talks, the hair dryer inflates his pants, giving him the ability to fly. He goes around helping people, earning their admiration and becoming a superhero of sorts. However, the people continue to ask increasingly unnecessary favors of him, leaving him no time to fly with the jellyfish. When he tries to escape to Jellyfish Fields, the people form a mob and chase him, but are unable to catch him. However, Cannonball Jenkins launches himself at SpongeBob, destroying the pants and sending him plummeting to the ground. The people then hold a funeral for his now-deflated pants. Depressed, SpongeBob decides to go home, but the jellyfish help him fly and take him back home. SpongeBob decides to leave the flying to the jellyfish. After the episode, Patchy attempts to play it again but ruins the tape.
