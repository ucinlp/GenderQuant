A corrupt prison system comes under scrutiny in this action drama about a racketeering lesbian inmate, crooked wardens, drug traffickers, and another female prisoner who challenges the system. Silvia  refuses to cooperate with Susana  when she comes around to induce her to take drugs, an act which gets her severely beaten and her younger sister murdered. Outraged at Susana's collusion with a handful of corrupt wardens and drug barons, Silvia vows revenge, and, with the help of some inmates and a decent warden, she escapes from prison for one night to carry out a plan that is meant to eliminate the drug traffickers, Susana, and their prison minions â€” on both side of the bars.
