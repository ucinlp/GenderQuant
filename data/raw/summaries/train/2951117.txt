Savage Sam is Old Yeller's son. He is a Bluetick Coonhound, and every bit as courageous and loyal as his father, as well as an incredibly keen tracker. Sam mostly likes chasing a bobcat, sometimes with Arliss. Brian Keith plays the boy's Uncle Beck  who comes by to check on how the boys are doing and gives advice to Travis on how to handle Arliss a little better.  Travis, Arliss, and their neighbor's daughter, Lisbeth Searcy  are taken captive by Indians. Uncle Beck gathers up some neighboring men to go in search of them, which includes Lisbeth's somewhat overbearing father, Bud Searcy  and Slim Pickens joins the group as well. Travis manages to escape and is found by the search party , and the whole search party, along with Travis and Savage Sam, rescue Arliss and Lisbeth.
