A tabloid reporter  uses a scheme to meet Sara Farley , a grocery-store heiress he's been writing unflattering things about. He gets her to start talking about herself and finds her down to earth. Tierney assumes he's going to write more lies, so she announces to the press that the two of them are married. In trying to get the truth out, he loses his job; what follows is classic farce and the stakes escalate. Finally, he sues her for libel and the courts takes it from there!
