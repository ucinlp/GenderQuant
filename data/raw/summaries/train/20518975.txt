Woody Woodpecker sends Knothead and Splinter on an errand to deliver a basket of goodies to their Grandmother's house. They encounter a Wolf and soon realize that the events are occurring just like the Little Red Riding Hood story. However, things start to differ once Granny gets a good look at the Wolf. She falls head over heels in love with him and goes to redo her make-up. She puts on a red curly wig, curls her eyelashes, puts on a red shade of lipstick and powders her face. She embraces the Wolf and plants a giant kiss on his lips while red hearts appear in the air.
