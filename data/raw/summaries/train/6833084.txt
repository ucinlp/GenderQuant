The movie follows a man's search for perfection in a world where life rarely measures up to the idealized images that constantly bombard us. Freeman plays Gary Shaller, who gained commercial success in previous years as the keyboard player in the fictional band "On The One". He is in a dull relationship, and working for his former band mate Paul, played by Simon Pegg, writing and recording commercial jingles. Gary eventually discovers that he is having lucid dreams about a glamorous woman named Anna, played by Pen√©lope Cruz, with whom he is deeply infatuated. He aims to learn more about lucid dreaming by buying books and even attending classes taught by an eccentric lucid-dreaming enthusiast, Mel . Gary eventually discovers that the girl he dreams about does, in fact, exist. Paul arranges for Gary to meet her, but this proves disappointing, as she fails to live up to the expectations that Gary has built up in his dreams of her. He eventually continues to dream about her, and even soundproofs his apartment, and makes other efforts to be able to sleep longer, so that he can remain with Anna for longer periods of time. Eventually, feeling as though he is betraying his girlfriend Dora, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, he attempts to go back to her.
