Chloe, an attractive French artist moves into William's bleak apartment block and expresses an interest in him, bringing him an abstract portrait as a gift. They become an item and William's life appears to be taking a turn for the better. This is short lived however, as out of the blue William starts receiving strange messages relating to the disappearance of his brother. His relationship with Chloe starts to suffer as William becomes very paranoid, believing a strange man is following him and sending him the messages. William catches sight of the mysterious man leaving his apartment block. Inside he finds Chloe, deeply upset after being attacked by the man and threatened. She is instructed to give William a message: the whereabouts of his brothers body. William and Chloe immediately embark on a car journey to the forest location where the man has instructed them to find the grave. Upon arriving, they are greeted by the mysterious man, Harry. Harry reveals his involvement in David's killing and points to where the body is buried. William attacks Harry and demands more information. Harry, bloodied and bruised from Williams punches reveals that it was not he who killed David, but Chloe. William, deeply shocked listens as Harry explains how Chloe seemingly accidentally asphyxiated David. William snaps, believing Harry to be lying to him, he launches at him once again, only to impale him accidentally on a tree stump, killing him. Chloe suddenly changes, revealing her true personality, and claiming that she planned for William to kill Harry all along, freeing her of the only witness to David's death. After a short struggle with Chloe, William realises he is trapped, blackmailed into burying Harry's body and keeping Chloe's evil secrets from the police.
