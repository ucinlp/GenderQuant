A group of four anarchist drummers led by a conductor and a female musician set out to make music with objects that are generally considered non-musical. They plan out a concert with four hilariously titled movements to be played across the city after carefully analyzing what objects can be used to make good music. They begin by playing in a hospital room using a fat patient admitted for rectal surgery for percussion. Their next piece is set in a bank where they "hold up" the staff and customers. They then feed banknotes into the shredding machine for a distorted bass sound. The next piece uses bulldozers thumping the ground at the fountain in front of an opera house. For the final crescendo, they strike the fountain knocking it to the ground. The last piece involves them hanging from high tension power cables and playing the suspended cables like violins. All the while, they are pursued by a tone-deaf policeman born into a distinguished musical family{{cite web}} who hates the sound of music.
