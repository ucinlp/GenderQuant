Friends since their childhood days, the couple begins to live in a small house owned by Vivek in Chennai. Meanwhile, Bhaskar, a research scholar in Chemistry, succeeds in coming out with a prototype of a desalination plant which he wants to give to the government and solve the water crisis in Chennai. He eventually gets discouraged by the government authorities and even the State Minister. He then decides to prove everyone wrong and plans to set up his own desalination plant based on the methods of his research. Along with Archana, he runs from pillar to post for loan. In between, the couple falls in love and ties the knot. Enter Madan Prithviraj Sukumaran in Tamil Debut), a college mate of Archana. Madan gets acquainted with their family. Coming to know of their troubles, the rich Madan volunteers to help them and even lends money. All troubles begin only now. Madan happens to be a 'business consultant' who lends money to companies, corporates and individuals at exorbitant rates of interest and uses his might to recover them. In Bhaskar's case, he begins to trouble them demanding his money back and threatens to take over the research works of Bhaskar with which he aspires to make a huge sum. The screen play is clear to move the story with good twists and good romance between the lead pair. The highlight of the movie is Prithviraj - cool acting as new kind of soft spoken villain in his debut - where his acting is praised in many reviews. The vivek portion of the comedy is not so good, but makes sense of relief. The movie after several twists and turns ends on a happy note.
