After a small town nuclear power plant dumps hazardous waste into a forest surrounding the small town, people begin dying in increasingly gruesome ways. People cannot pinpoint the source of the deaths, until the EPA investigates, proving that the forests' roots were mutated due to the waste, beginning to kill and eat people. The plants attempt to break loose, however the EPA arrives again and bulldozes the plants, killing them, leaving the possibility that some more plants may have survived.
