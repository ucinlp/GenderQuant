The cartoon opens with Insp.Clouseau and Deux-Deux sitting in their car and eating sandwiches as a snack.The Inspector asks Deux-Deux if he would like to eat his peanut butter sandwich instead of the Mexican sandwich.Deux-Deux does so.The Inspector bites into the sandwich,but his face burns up.Deux-Deux says it's a tabasco sandwich.Suddenly,Dreyfus tunes into the radio,interuppting the song they are listening to,telling them to pursue a spy named X.They chase him,but get covered with pink laughing gas.They crash,with Deux-Deux breaking his back and the Inspector breaking his right leg.They chase X on a sub,then go to Africa only to get blown up by a camel.They then shuffle through the sandstorms of the desert.Deux-Deux asks the Inspector if they can stop so that he can get the sand out of his boots.The camera pulls away to reveal X on a bike with a fan on it,making the sandstorm.The Inspector and Deux-Deux trail him up Kililmanjaro.Deux-Deux tells the Inspector that he has chilblains on his tiny feet and that he wishes they were on the Inspector's feet instead.They find X at the top of the hill and walk up to him.X jumps down with a parachute.The Inspector watches him.While watching,his foot slips off the hill.The Inspector trips over his other foot,grabs Deux-Deux,and the two begin to fall.Luckily,Deux-Deux releases a tent,allowing them to fall gently to the ground,but a big lynx is in the tent too,so they are scratched.They get back home and explain that they didn't catch X.Dreyfus says that X is not a spy at all,but the new PT instructor,much to Clouseau's dismay.
