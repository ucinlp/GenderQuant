During the British Raj, Sergeant Donald McDuff escorts Joyce Williams, an impoverished widow, and her young daughter, Priscilla, to a remote military outpost on the northern frontier of India, to live with her stern father-in-law, Colonel Williams. Along the way, they witness the capture of notorious rebel chief Khoda Khan. Soon, Priscilla, nicknamed 'Wee Willie Winkie' by McDuff, wins the hearts of all the soldiers, especially her grandfather and McDuff; even Khoda Khan is touched by her visits to cheer him up in his captivity. Meanwhile, her mother is courted by Lieutenant Brandes. Khoda Khan is rescued by his men in a daring night raid and a fight breaks out. McDuff is fatally wounded while out on patrol. He passes away in the hospital, while Winkie sings "Auld Lang Syne" to him. Winkie decides to persuade Khoda Khan to stop fighting when Mohammed-din, a soldier who is actually Khan's spy, smuggles her out of the base and takes her to the rebel mountain fortress. Khoda Khan is greatly pleased; he thinks that the colonel will bring his entire regiment in a hopeless attempt to rescue her. Colonel Williams halts his force out of range and walks alone to the entrance. A few of Khan's men start shooting at Williams, and Winkie rushes to her grandfather's side. Impressed by the colonel's courage and overcome with empathy for the child, Khoda Khan orders his men to stop firing. He agrees to negotiate and the war ends.
