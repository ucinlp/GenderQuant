Two 13-year-old blind girls Marie and Inga are close friends in a boarding school for the blind, and share a love for music. The girls are fairly sheltered in their school, and have a motto, "Trau bloß keinem Gucki!" . They try out for a school band, but despite their musical skills they are turned away for their blindness. Then Marie meets a young émigré from Kazakhstan, "Herbert" , and hides him from the police in the school, with the help of the sighted caretaker Mr. Karl . Herbert needs money to return to his homeland, against his father's wishes. Inga proposes that the three form a band of clowns  to play music in the street, "The Blind Flyers", with Herbert pretending to be blind as well. The band is successful—for a time. According to the director, the film was not supposed to be about blindness per se, and aimed to portray blind people as normal. And although the characters Marie and Inga are totally blind, they are played by partially sighted actresses Ricarda Ramünke  and Maria Rother, who in real life attend boarding schools for the visually impaired.
