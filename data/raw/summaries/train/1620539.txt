Franklin Hatchett  is a car wash hustler, who gets dimed out to the police by an investigating news reporter named James Russell . When placed on a prison transport unit, he is handcuffed to a European criminal named Villard. The transport unit is attacked on a bridge, with the intent of busting Villard out. The attackers kill everyone with the exception of Villard and Franklin; they escape on a helicopter with another European named Dubray. While on the helicopter, Hatchett overhears the location of a cache of stolen diamonds. Hatchett then jumps out of the helicopter after hearing the discussion between Villard and Dubray to get rid of him. Now Hatchett's name and face are all over the news as an accessory to the prison break. Hatchett has to clear his name but he needs help. He calls on the only person who can help, the one that dimed him out, James Russell. Russell had just gotten fired from his job at Channel 12 News. Because he had the Top Story calling him on his phone asking for help improved his chances of getting his job back, because it was Sweeps Week. The two rampage all over the city to find clues to clear Hatchett's name, which eventually gets Russell's name involved and spread all over the news. Now, in the process of trying to clear both their names, the two find something more valuable than diamonds. Soon a gang war breaks out at a local colliseum when two separate gangs brawl in gun fights and threaten Franklin's life. Luckily, Franklin was saved when two of his friends used a bazooka and a machine gun to kill the thugs. James then kills Villard by placing several grenades under the chopper, blowing it up along with Villard. In the end both of their names are cleared and they are branded heroes. Franklin and James save two of the diamonds as jewelry pieces and James marries Grace with Franklin as his best man.
