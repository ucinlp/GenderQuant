The film is about the inexplicable love between two girls, Sally and the meek and tradition-bound Nirmala. The two girls run away during a school trip in order to punish their teacher Devika who organised the trip. Their journey is soon interrupted by a man, Harisankar, who mysteriously befriends the girls, while Nirmala starts to develop romantic feelings for Harisankar. Sally strongly objects to this relationship and warns her friend against the suspicious nature of the man. Nirmala, who was almost convinced to leave everything behind to be with the man she loves, gets a shock when she finds out that the man was actually in love with the teacher whom she despised and ran away from. Unable to find a way out of the misery that befalls them, Sally and Nirmala cling on to each other and commit suicide.
