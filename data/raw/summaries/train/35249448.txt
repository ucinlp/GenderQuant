Between the late 190s and 200s during the Eastern Han Dynasty, Cao Cao defeated LÃ¼ Bu and other rival warlords to gain supremacy in northern China. In 216, Cao Cao forced Emperor Xian to grant him the title of a vassal king, "King of Wei". Cao Cao then had the Bronze Sparrow Platform constructed as a display of power. Mu Shun and Lingju, a pair of young lovers who have undergone five years of training as assassins in a prisoner-of-war camp, are preparing to accomplish a secret mission. In 220, Cao Cao's son Cao Pi urges his father to take the Han throne and replace Emperor Xian. Many people strongly object to this idea.
