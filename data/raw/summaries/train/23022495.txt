The story centers around a group of people that arrive at "Hart Island", which has recently been purchased by real estate tycoon "Rupert King" to build what he calls "Hope City", supposedly to help the poor and homeless of the city. The only problem is that the city of New York has been burying their unknown dead there since 1869. The group of people include King along with his personal assistant, a New York cop looking for a missing girl's body and some employees from the Department of Corrections with inmates used to bury the unknown dead. Initially, the personal assistant goes missing after being attacked by what appears to be a swarm of aggressive flies. Later, he's found dead and badly decomposed. Large maggots feed on the corpse. The flies continue to attack, picking off the party one by one. When the group realizes the danger, they desperately try to escape.
