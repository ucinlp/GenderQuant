Shot in digital video, this surreal, metaphysical meditation on existence and identity finds a man  and a woman  trapped in an apparent dream taking place in the labyrinthine corridors and strange rooms of a seaside 1930s hotel. The man knows nothing about his past or how he ended up in the hotel, but is accused by two men of having committed a crime at some previous point in his life. Every time he falls asleep, the man is tortured by a recurring nightmare of living in an impoverished apartment with a woman and a baby. Gradually, the man and woman fall in love as they try to figure out what has led to their imprisonment, and together they resort to extreme measures to break out of the dream. The dream takes on even more sinister proportions when the couple realize that one of the hotel's bizarre inhabitants may in fact be dreaming them.
