A denizen  of a faraway planet occupied only by highly evolved males is ordered to find a female human, impregnate her and bring the baby back to the planet. The visitor to Earth assumes the name Harold Anderson and eventually meets Susan , a recovering alcoholic. He must marry her before he can try to mate. Greg Kinnear plays Harold's sleazy, conniving co-worker at the bank, and John Goodman co-stars as an FAA worker obsessed with finding the alien.
