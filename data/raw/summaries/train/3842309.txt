After claiming he is an extraterrestrial from the planet 'K-PAX', 1,000 light years away, in the Lyra constellation, prot  is committed to the Psychiatric Institute of Manhattan. There psychiatrist Mark Powell  evaluates him to find if he is delusional. However, prot is unwavering in his ability to provide cogent answers to questions about himself, K-PAX and its civilization. Dr. Powell introduces him to a group of astrophysicists, where prot claims to have journeyed to Earth by means of "light-travel" and goes on to display a level of knowledge that puzzles them. prot also exhibits considerable influence over the other patients at the Institute, each of whom believes unquestioningly that he is indeed from K-PAX. prot has explained that he can take one person with him when he returns. Thereafter most of the patients at the institute ask to be taken to K-PAX. Upon learning that many of his patients expect to leave Earth on July 27, Dr. Powell confronts prot, who explains that it is a predetermined date. However, Powell believes this to be a significant date in prot's life, a day on which he suffered a severe psychological trauma. Powell then decides to subject prot to regression hypnosis, which works well. Using information gained from these sessions, Powell figures out that prot may simply be an alter ego  of Robert Porter, whose life has been devastated by the murder of his wife and child in 1996 and his subsequent killing of the perpetrator. On July 27, prot is found lying, catatonic, under his bed and one of the other patients, Bess, is missing. She is never found, and prot never wakes up. The other patients do not recognize Robert as he is being wheeled out of the room. Later Prot explains to Powell how we repeat the same mistakes over and over again, so the only way is to have it right this time around. Powell reconciles with his estranged son.
