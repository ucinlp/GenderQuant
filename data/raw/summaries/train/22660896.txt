George Kelly , dubbed "Machine Gun" by his partner in crime Flo Becker  because of his obsession with that weapon, pulls off a bank robbery and eventually becomes Public Enemy Number One. Discord grows among his inner circle, and Kelly, deathly afraid of being jailed or killed, is dominated and ridiculed by the tough-talking Flo. A botched robbery causes one of their partners, Michael Fandango  to lose an arm. Kelly, goaded on by Flo, kidnaps the daughter of a wealthy businessman for ransom. Fandango fingers him to the police, but is killed by one of Kelly's gang as the house is surrounded. Kelly intends to surrender, if only to receive a more lenient sentence and avoid execution. Flo again questions his nerve, whereupon Kelly slugs her with his fist, knocking her unconscious. Both are taken away to jail.
