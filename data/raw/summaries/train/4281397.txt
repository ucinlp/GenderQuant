Parish sheriff Darl Hardwick is the chief investigator in a controversial investigation of the murder of a transsexual. The dignitaries of the small village react nervously, and want the whole thing hushed up. Darl is replaced by the influential judges of the town. Normally, he would have no problem with that, but he grows more interested in the case when he meets the attractive wife of the murder victim, and urges a thorough investigation. The investigation costs him his job - and nearly gets him killed.
