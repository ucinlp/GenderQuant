Morgan Delt is a failed irresponsible leftist artist and son of communist parents who own a fish & chips shop in downmarket London. The film starts off when his terribly upper class wife Leonie has given up on him and has just secured a divorce in order to marry Charles Napier, an art gallery owner of her own social standing. Given the innately rich and personal world of fantasy he has left himself locked into, Morgan goes off the deep end, enacting a series of bizarre stunts in a campaign to win Leonie back, including putting a skeleton in her bed and crashing her wedding dressed as a gorilla, for which scene Reisz borrows clips from from the original King Kong film to illustrate Morgan's fantasy world. Still failing to win her back, Morgan now secures the help of his mother's wrestler friend Wally "The Gorilla"  to kidnap Leonie, who still nurtures feelings of residual love tinged with pity for Morgan but in the end, Morgan is arrested and committed to an insane asylum, where a most pregnant Leonie visits him looking visibly terribly pregnant. In the flash of a wink from Leonie that tells him he is the child's father, Morgan's eyes and smile light up his sedated face with a malicious twinkle before he returns to tending a flowerbed as the camera pulls out to a longshot of the entire circular flowerbed -- with the enclosed flowers arranged into a hammer and sickle.
