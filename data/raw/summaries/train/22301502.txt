It is Halloween in the Hundred Acre Wood, and while Tigger is excited at the prospect of being scared this Halloween, Piglet is too afraid to take part in the festivities. After wreaking havoc in Rabbit's garden of pumpkins, and as nightfall brings a thunderstorm, the terrified Piglet retreats to his home, declaring he will not join Winnie the Pooh, Eeyore and Tigger for Halloween. To compensate, Pooh declares they shall have an unfrightening "Hallo-Wasn't" for Piglet's sake, much to Tigger's dismay. However, when Pooh, Eeyore, and Tigger arrive at Piglet's house later in the evening dressed as "Spookables", Piglet mistakes them for actual Spookables and flees into the night to warn his friends; seeing the Piglet-shaped hole Piglet made in the wall in his panic to escape, the three believe Piglet to have been captured by Spookables himself, and set off to rescue their friend. In the woods, Pooh becomes caught in a branch with his costume on, and when Eeyore and Tigger try to pull him down, Piglet mistakes the scene for Pooh being attacked by Spookables. Determined to save his friend, Piglet uses the dummy he'd made earlier to fend off the "Spookables", resulting in the others believing an actual monster is coming for them. The panic ends when Piglet is able to chase the others back to Rabbit's pumpkin garden, and crashes his dummy, making the others believe he vanquished the beast. Happy he has conquered his fears of Halloween at last, Piglet's friends congratulate and thank them for saving them all, and Tigger is happy he received a scare on Halloween after all; Gopher also finds a costume that everyone likes . The film ends with Winnie the Pooh, Eeyore, Tigger, Rabbit, Gopher, and Piglet trick-or-treating together as a group, not afraid of Halloween so long as they have each other.
