Two scientists invent a time machine. A critical part  falls out of the time machine before they get into it to test it. Nothing seems to happen at first, but when they wake up the next day they are regressing in age . Their kids, Marie  and Eddie  seem to notice something strange is going on, judging by their behavior. Soon enough, the children realize that it is the machine that has changed their parents. The parents gradually get younger and the kids notice that the fish that their parents were experimenting on earlier seemed to just disappear after growing younger in a "poof" of sorts. The point at which something ceases to exist thus becomes known as the "poof point". The kids know they have to get the parents in the machine and reverse the effect some way before their parents, too, just "poof" away.
