Paul Maddens  is a "frustrated, under-achieving primary school teacher". Every year St Bernadette's school competes with a local private school  to see who can produce the best nativity play. Maddens is chosen to create the Nativity play, but he doesn't like Christmas because his ex-girlfriend moved to Hollywood. Maddens still loves his ex-girlfriend but she split up with him when he was about to propose. Maddens went to drama school with his ex-girlfriend and another teacher Gordon Shakespeare ([[Jason Watkins . The headteacher Mrs Bevans  gives him a new class teaching assistant called Desmond Poppy who turns out to be her nephew. St Bernadette's always comes in second to Gordon Shakespeare's private school, Oakmoor. Maddens lies to Shakespeare about how a Hollywood producer, his ex-girlfriend Jennifer Lore , will be turning his production into a Hollywood film starring his pupils. Poppy , an over-enthusiastic classroom assistant, spreads the rumour, and soon Maddens finds his lie is out of control. He even travels to America to try to persuade his ex-girlfriend to visit, and discovers she is a secretary and not a film producer and is unsuccessful in his Hollywood aim. To make the Nativity seem more real, Mr Poppy takes the children to see a woman giving birth  and to go to a farm to see the animals that in the story come up to the manger to see the baby Jesus. But finally, with Poppy's help, the nativity is performed, and, despite a sabotage attempt by Shakespeare , the play is a great success, the Hollywood producer Mr Parker visits the play and Maddens and Jennifer are reunited. Happily ever after. The film finishes with Mr Maddens and his girlfriend Jennifer decorating the outside of Mr Maddens house with Christmas lights.
