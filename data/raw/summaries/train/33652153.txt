Do-chul is a boxer whose recent string of losses cause him to give up the sport. While visiting a credit bureau on the insistence of the gym owner, he meets Hong-ki who is a habitual swindler constantly scheming while proclaiming he'll own a high-rise building in six years. During his stay at Hong-ki's rented room, he meets Mimi, a would-be actress. Hong-ki tries to seduce Mimi by promising her that he would cast her in a movie. At a party thrown for aspiring actors and actresses, drunken Do-chul creates a scene and gets his head smashed with a beer bottle by Mimi's manager. With this, he ends up in a hospital. Hong-ki runs away with Do-chul's compensation pay, blowing it all on horse race betting. With nowhere else to go, Do-chul stays at his gym. Tired of being hunted down by a collector, Hong-ki kills him as Do-chul is mercilessly beaten inside the ring.
