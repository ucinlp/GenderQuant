Gwiaździsta eskadra told the romantic story of love between a Polish girl and an American volunteer pilot in the Polish 7th Air Escadrille  during the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1921. The story was inspired by the actual life of Merian C. Cooper, a Polish Air Force officer during the war, but much better known for his later career as an adventurer, director, screenwriter and producer. Cooper fathered Polish translator and writer Maciej Słomczyński during his time in Poland.
