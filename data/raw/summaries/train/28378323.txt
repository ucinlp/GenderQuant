Rajiv  comes from a wealthy land-owning family, and lives in a palatial home with his mother, who would like him to get married to a beautiful young woman named Vijaya Singh, the only daughter of Thakur Ajay Singh . Rajiv, however, is in love with Rajni , who is an orphan without connections. When Rajiv informs his mother of his intent to marry Rajni, she refuses to give her blessings, but relents after a favourable meeting with Rajni. The marriage is arranged and they enjoy their wedded bliss - that is, until the arrival of Bhairo Nath , a sadhu capable of controlling snakes. He informs Rajiv's mum that Rajni is a shape-shifting venomous snake who has married Rajiv to avenge the death of her spouse during Rajiv's childhood. What Rajiv's mum does not know is that Bhairo Nath has a secret agenda in entrapping Rajni, a secret the knowledge of which will shatter and change their lives forever.
