{{Expand section}} Stephen Rojack, a war hero, returns home to become a tough-talking television commentator who strongly criticizes the police's inability to put an end to the criminal activities of an organized-crime figure, Ganucci. Separated from his alcoholic wife, Deborah, he goes to her seeking a divorce. A violent argument breaks out, ending with Rojack throwing her from a 30-story window. At the police station, where he tells the police his wife committed suicide, Rojack runs into Ganucci as well as the gangster's nephew, Nicky, and nightclub singer Cherry McMahon, a former girlfriend of his. Rojack resumes his romantic interest in Cherry, further infuriating the Ganuccis. His dead wife's father, Barney Kelly, is suspicious about Deborah's death and confronts Rojack, getting him to admit his guilt. Instead of informing the police, Barney decides to let Rojack struggle with his conscience. Meanwhile, bribing her with a singing contract, the Ganuccis are able to convince Cherry to lure Rojack into an ambush. At the last second, she breaks down and warns him. Rojack takes her gun and is able to shoot Nicky, but then is gunned down himself.
