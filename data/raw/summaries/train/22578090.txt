In order to write an expose on how cheerleading demeans women, a reporter for a college newspaper infiltrates the cheerleading squad. While doing so, she uncovers unscrupulous dealings; the coach and dean are in cahoots in rigging football games to favor betting spreads the statistics professor, who is also the bookie, arranges. Later the statistics professor turns against the coach and dean as they turn against their star quarterback who they want to convince to throw the game for a big payoff. But when confronted, the quarterback refuses on principle and is arrested by University Police who plant a joint on him as they carry out the deans ultimatum. The movie endorses defiance of authority, and questions love and virginity.
