While there, Larry becomes romantically interested in a local girl named Gwen Conliffe , who runs an antique shop. As a pretext to converse with her, he purchases a silver-headed walking stick decorated with a wolf. Gwen tells him that it represents a werewolf  Throughout the film, various villagers recite a poem, whenever the subject of werewolves comes up: :Even a man who is pure in heart : and says his prayers by night : may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms : and the autumn moon is bright. That night, Larry attempts to rescue Gwen's friend Jenny from what he believes to be a sudden wolf attack. He kills the beast with his new walking stick, but is bitten on the chest in the process. A gypsy fortuneteller named Maleva  reveals to Larry that the animal which bit him was actually her son Bela  in the form of a wolf. Bela had been a werewolf for years and now Larry will be transformed into one as well. Talbot transforms into a wolf-like creature and stalks the village, first killing the local gravedigger. Talbot retains vague memories of being a werewolf and wanting to kill, and continually struggles to overcome his condition. He is finally bludgeoned to death by his father with his own silver walking stick after attacking Gwen. Sir John Talbot watches in horror as the werewolf transforms into his son's human form as the local police arrive on the scene.
