Quoting director Luke Eberl, “The Movie is about Clive who’s a young man who bottoms out financially in Los Angeles and he ends up meeting an agent who draws him into his powerful circle of friends in the Hollywood community. It’s sort of an exploration of personal identity built in the prism of show business, weaving elements through sexuality, paranoia, power and loss.” {{cite web}}
