The Pink Panther is backpacking through Transylvania and stops to spend a night at a castle, believing it to be a lodge. It is in fact a vampire's castle also occupied by a hairy, knife-throwing hand, a Yeti-link phantom in squeaky shoes, and a shark in the moat. Thinking the vampire's coffin to be that of a dead man, the Pink Panther buries it. Dusk arrives, the coffin rumbles to surface, and the vampire emerges. The Pink Panther repeatedly tries to repel the vampire. This invariably causes the vampire to go out the window and fall into a moat, where he is preyed on by the shark. By the end, sunrise causes the vampire, shark, phantom, and castle to all disappear.
