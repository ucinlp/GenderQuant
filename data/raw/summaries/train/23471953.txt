The Trojan Women was one of a trilogy of plays dealing with the suffering created by the Trojan Wars. Hecuba , Queen of the Trojans and mother of Hector, one of Troys most fearsome warriors, looks upon the remains of her kingdom; Andromache , widow of the slain Hector and mother of his son Astyanax, must raise her son in the war's aftermath; Cassandra , Hecuba's daughter who has been driven insane by the ravages of war, waits to see if King Agamemnon will drive her into concubinage; Helen of Troy , waits to see if she will live. But the most awful truth is unknown to them until Talthybius , the messenger of the Greek king, comes to the ruined city and tells them that King Agamemnon and his brother Menelaus have decreed that Hector's son Astyanax must die â€” the last of the male royalty of Troy must be executed to ensure the extinction of the line.
