Natarajan  is a Brahmin house-owner near the Parthasarathy Temple looking for a right tenant for the upper portion of his house. He is very protective of his college going beautiful daughter Gayathri . Since he often fears that the prospective tenant might romance with his daughter he filters all the people who come asking for the house. He rents out the house to five bachelor students who pretend to be good and later become a big headache for the father and daughter. On the advice of ‘Auto’ ([[Vivek , Natarajan brings Subramani  who charades himself as ‘Bottle Mani’, a dreaded thug to vacate the students. Incidentally Mani, who stays with his Jailor uncle , was thrown out of his house as he refuses to marry his daughter. Taking advantage of the situation, Mani befriends the five boys and starts staying with them. Priya  is the daughter of a wealthy gangster  and she is engaged to an affluent sadist ACP ([[Rahman . On the day of marriage Priya comes to know that her fiancée is already married and had murdered his first wife in a sadistic manner but her father forces her to marry him to cover up his illegal activities. She consumes poison just before the wedding time but was mistakenly kidnapped by Mani and Auto. Now Priya becomes one more addition in the upstairs portion. The rest of the story is how they fall for each other and how Mani saves her from the clutches of her dad and fiancee and marries her at the end.
