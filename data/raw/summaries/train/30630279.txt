Eight year old Ardal Travis has a crush on his second class  teacher Ms. Purdy. He demonstrates his affections by giving her a toy ring. While shopping with his mother Ardal sees Ms. Purdy who happily explains that she has just been proposed to by her boyfriend Pierce and is engaged to be married. Pierce appears to be a jerk. He refuses to take Ms. Purdy for lunch to celebrate the hour old engagement, instead insisting on going home to watch football. Ardal sees his dad put a gun carefully in the closet; he stares into the closet contemplating his options. Ardal confronts Pierce while he is impatiently waiting for Ms.Purdy outside of the school. Ardal challenges Pierce to a duel to the death, which Pierce mockingly accepts. The next day Ardal meets Pierce in the school yard, Pierce forgets his gun on purpose and Ardal pulls a gun on him. Pierce at first believes it is a toy, but Ardal insists it is not. Ms. Purdy attempts to intervene but Ardal refuses to back down. Pierce, reduced to a crying mess lies about that he never loved Ms. Purdy but only proposed to her to “shut her up.” Ardal shoots Pierce and he falls to the ground. It is revealed that the gun was a toy after all that Ardal’s father was saving in the closet until his birthday. Ms. Purdy angrily calls off the engagement and breaks up with Pierce. She walks Ardal home agreeing to “keep this between ourselves.” Ardal then proposes to Ms. Purdy and they go off hand in hand.
