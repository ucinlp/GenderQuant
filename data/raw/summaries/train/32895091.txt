The film opens with a young mining contractor, Philip Maxwell , blowing up a rock at a mining site, then going to the bank to get wages for his crew. "The Lizard", a camp loafer, learns about this and informs Black Dan Bryce , who decides to rob Philip with his gang. This is overheard by Dan's step daughter Sylvia  who rides for help. Philip, finding he is pursued, conceals the money just before he is captured by Dan and refuses to say where it is. Dan tries to get him to talk by tying Philip to a stake in the middle of a rising tidal creek, but Sylvia manages to alert Philip's mining crew, who come to the rescue. Two years later Philip and Sylvia are married and have a baby, Edna. Their house is burgled by Dan and his old gang, who recognise Sylvia and kidnap her. Unable to find any trace of his wife, Philip thinks she has left him, so sells his property and goes abroad with Edna . Black Dan's gang argue amongst themselves enabling Sylvia to escape. When she finds Philip has gone she enters a convent and becomes a teacher. Three years later Philip and Edna return to Australia and are reunited with Sylvia through the chance discovery of a lost bangle of Edna's.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900â€“1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 24"PUBLIC AMUSEMENTS.
