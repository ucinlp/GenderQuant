Pil-gi  has finally saved enough money to make his late father's wish come true: He can buy his own house. However, upon moving in to his new residence, he is bothered by one if its previous residents, a poltergeist, who claims the house belongs to it and attempts to scare him out. Pil-gi will not give up on his dream so easily, though. He calls the police, invites friends to stay for the night, and tries exorcism rituals. None of it works. During one attack by the poltergeist he is struck by lightning and awakes in a hospital. He eventually decides it would be best to sell the house, but upon returning he discovers that he can see the ghost who has been haunting him. She reveals that her name is Win-ha , and, now less frightened, Pil-gi talks to her and he decides to stay. However, an investor looking to build a new hotel on the site makes Pil-gi an offer to buy the house. Now it is Win-ha's turn to be afraid. She begs him not to sell the house and tells him her life story. Pil-gi vows to help her keep her house.
