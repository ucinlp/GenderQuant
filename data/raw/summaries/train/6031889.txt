Stephen "Hannibal" Brooks  is a British prisoner of war officer put to work in a Munich zoo, looking after an Asian elephant called Lucy. When the zoo is bombed by the Americans the zoo's director  determines it is unsafe for the elephant to remain there. So he sends Brooks along with hostile German soldier Kurt , a friendly German soldier named Willy  and Vronia, a female cook to accompany the elephant to Innsbruck Zoo via train. They are forced to walk when an SS commander  tells Brooks that the elephant is not allowed on the train. In Austria, Kurt threatens to shoot Lucy whilst drunk and Brooks accidentally kills Kurt. Brooks, Lucy, Willy and Vronia are forced to run towards the Swiss border. They are helped along the way by an American escapee named Packy  who has formed a group of partisans to fight the Germans in Austria, after many run-ins with the Nazis.Half way there, Lucy gets mumps, so Brooks had to get an Austrian doctor  to look after her, whilst Vronia and Willy run to Willy's parents house. Vronia and Willy are captured, and later are joined by Brooks. Brooks and Willy are rescued by Packy and continue to race towards Switzerland with Lucy. Unfortunately, along the way Willy is shot by the Nazis whilst helping Brooks to escape. When Brooks gets close to the border with Lucy, he is met with German Col. von Haller , the SS commander who told him to walk to Switzerland and Vronia, who has changed sides after being captured. After another long fight with the Germans, Brooks and Lucy eventually make it to Switzerland with Packy and his partisans.
