Fred Miller  must prove that his new design for an underwater home is viable by convincing his family to live in it for thirty days. His son and daughter  are members of an emerging pop rock band  whom they invite to live with them during the experiment. Their temporary home, which Miller dubs the "Green Onion," is 90 feet below the surface of the ocean and is filled with super-modern appliances and amenities for house-wife Vivian  all designed by Miller, and a hole in the floor providing direct access to the sea. The group are soon joined by a live-in seal named Gladys and a pair of dolphins  which stay close at hand and fend off unwanted sharks. They are confronted by many obstacles including a rival designer  from Undersea Development Inc. who begins to cause problems for the inhabitants of the "Green Onion".Weiler, 1969. Meanwhile, the band's single has gotten the attention of record executive Nate Ashbury  who decides to sign them sight-unseen. He takes the liberty of booking them for an important television performance on The Merv Griffin Show without communicating with them first. After learning that they are inaccessible, he proves that he will go to great lengths to reach them since the show must go on. The band gets its airing, and the Navy is alerted by the sounds of the music coming from the sea. As naval fleets swarm in to investigate what must surely be a Communist plot, the movie abruptly ends.
