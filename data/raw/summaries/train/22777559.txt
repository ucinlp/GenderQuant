Man-soo, a railroad engineer, experiences a traumatic accident, while Hanna, a German-language university lecturer who is having an affair with one of her colleagues, also suffers a personal tragedy. The two meet after boarding a train on the Gyeongui Line, and find themselves stranded in heavy snow at the last stop before the Korean Demilitarized Zone. With no other choice they are forced to spend the night together, and over time they begin to open up to each other and reveal their inner pains.
