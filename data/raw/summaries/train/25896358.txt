A story of relationships, happythankyoumoreplease deals with the struggles facing several pairs trying to find their way. The film centers on Sam  and Rasheen , a writer and foster care child who meet when Rasheen is abandoned on the subway. Through this story we learn of Sam's best friend Annie , an Alopecia patient trying to find a reason to be loved, his friend Mary Catherine  and her boyfriend Charlie , a couple facing the prospect of leaving New York, and Mississippi , a waitress/singer trying to make it in the Big Apple. Happythankyoumoreplease captures a generational moment - young people on the cusp of truly growing up, tiring of their reflexive cynicism, each in their own ways struggling to connect and define what it means to love and be loved. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1481572/
