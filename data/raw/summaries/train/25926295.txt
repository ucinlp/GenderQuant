Granny and Tweety are riding through the desert in their wagon, to the tune of Oh! Susanna, when they are ambushed by Indians . They are forced to hole up in a fort, where Granny begins to shoot them down while Tweety counts . On the tenth, one nearly takes Tweety, but is shot down just in time. More attempts include an archer and a battering ram, both foiled. One archer almost drags Tweety out again  but Granny surprises him with a bomb instead. The cats' attempts continue like this, all of them backfiring or being foiled. Finally, Granny and Tweety disguise themselves as a fellow Indian, and lead the cats into the powder house. When one asks for a match, they kindly oblige, and the powder house explodes, causing all the cats to fall. "Oh my goodness!" Tweety comments, "It's raining putty tats!"
