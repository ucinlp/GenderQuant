Nelu, a man in his forties, works as a security guard in a local supermarket in the Romanian border town of Salonta. His life is uneventful: fishing at dawn, work during the day, and home with his wife in the evening. They live alone in the outskirts of the town and their main problem is repairing the old roof of their farmhouse. One morning, while fishing, Nelu meets a Turkish man trying to evade capture by the border guards. Nelu takes the stranger, desperate for help, to the farmhouse, gives him some dry clothes, food and shelter, although he doesnâ€™t really know how to help him cross the border. When his wife discovers the foreigner living in the cellar she insists he get rid of him, but he does not report the stranger to the authorities and puts him to work on his dilapidated farm. The Turkish man keeps insisting Nelu take all his money and help him reach Germany. Eventually, Nelu takes the money and promises he will help him cross the border the next day, reassuring him with the one word he knows in German: "morgen" .<ref namehttp://www.toronto.com/article/685759--rare-romanian-comedy-and-a-rocking-cult-classic |titleJason Anderson |date |publisher30 May 2011}}<ref namehttp://www.romania-insider.com/second-round-of-awards-for-romania-at-locarno-film-festival-morgen-by-marian-crisan/6841/ |title |date |publisher30 May 2011}}<ref namehttp://www.variety.com/review/VE1117943347?refcatidMorgen |author15 August 2010 |workVariety |accessdate=30 May 2011}}
