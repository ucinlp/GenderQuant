After a hit gone wrong, Nikita, an exiled Russian assassin, takes Zoe, a defected American libertine, on a sexually charged journey across the old Eastern Bloc in search of refuge and freedom. Pusuing them and intent on capture are members of eastern and western governments, the military-industrial complex, a private paramilitary group and a squad of South Slavic mercenaries. The hunt, however, is not what it seems as a revelation from Nikita changes a simple getaway into a potential catastrophic event that threatens the modern world and could lead to the annihilation of liberty.
