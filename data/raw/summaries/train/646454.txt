The film tells the story of a virtual-reality game designer, Jimi , who finds out that the main character of his game, Solo , has achieved sentience due to an attack by a computer virus. Asked by his creation  to eliminate its existence, Jimi sets out to erase the game from his employer's server before it's commercially released, and thus spare Solo further suffering. Jimi feels desperate because his wife Lisa  left him. He starts to search for her as he tries to delete Solo from the game. These two paths of his life complement in the story throughout the whole film. By the end, Jimi hacks into one of the company's servers. This hack is in the world of virtual reality interpreted as encounters with persons from Jimi's life. That is the way the network defends itself. It tries to keep the hacker's mind in the loop of his own memories as it burns the hacker's brain. The only way to pass through the network defence mechanism is to free one's mind. To forget about life before or after; to forget about bodily feelings; to enter a state of pure concentration, where one focuses only on the target . It is similar to meditation where one tries to concentrate on breathing. People who are able to do this are called angels . In the end Jimi feels enlightened. He is in inner peace with himself. He saved the character, understood why Lisa left and understands why the things happened in the way they happened. He is in the state of Nirvana.
