Soon after Harry Baldwin , his wife Ann , their son Rick , and daughter Karen  leave suburban Los Angeles on a camping trip, the Baldwins note unusually bright light flashes coming from a great distance. Sporadic news reports on CONELRAD broadcasts hint at the start of a World War, which is confirmed as the Baldwins see a large mushroom cloud over what was Los Angeles. The family initially attempts to return to rescue Ann's mother near Los Angeles, but soon abandons these plans as panicked refugees climb over one another to escape the fallout from the multiple nuclear explosions. Witnessing the very threads of society breaking down in front of them, Harry decides that the family must find refuge at their secluded vacation spot. Along the way, they stop to buy supplies, or, in the case of hardware store owner Ed Johnson , take them by force when he won't accept a check. They also encounter three threatening young hoodlums, Carl , Mickey , and Andy , on the road, but manage to drive them off. After a harrowing journey, the Baldwins reach their destination, finding shelter in a cave as they wait for order to be restored. They find that Johnson and his wife are their neighbors - but not for long. The three thugs appear and shoot them. A farming couple suffers the same fate and their teenage daughter, Marilyn  is kept as a sex slave. Karen is also raped when Mickey and Andy happen upon her. With guns in hand, the Baldwin men fight back, killing the two murderers and freeing Marilyn. When Carl returns, he is killed as well, but Rick is seriously wounded. With Marilyn's help, they get the young man to Doctor Strong . The doctor does what he can, but the boy needs to get to an army hospital over a hundred miles  away for a blood transfusion or he will die. On their drive there, they run into a military patrol, scouting for the army that is reestablishing order. After a tense meeting, they are allowed to continue.
