In fifteenth century France, the irreverent beggar Fran√ßois Villon  is crowned "king for a day" by King Louis XI . He patriotically rallies his fellow beggars to fight when Paris is invaded by the Burgundians. Kathryn Grayson stars as the high-born heroine, and Rita Moreno as the lusty low-born wench, whose love for Villon eventually costs her her life.
