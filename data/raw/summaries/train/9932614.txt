The story opens on a single mother and her two children, a teenage son and nine year old daughter, who run a boarding house. The mother is hurt in a car accident after her drunkard boyfriend crashed, so the son kidnaps her favorite singer, Elvis Presley, for her birthday, getting the owner of a local pizzeria who looks eerily like Elvis' mother to pose as his mother's ghost as a distraction. Elvis awakens, after being drugged by the boy, in the boarding house. Elvis and the boy don't get along at first. The boy has no respect for the 70's Elvis saying that he sold out to Vegas. Through the course of the movie, however, the boy and Elvis get to know each other and develop a friendship. Elvis even plays "Heartbreak Hotel" with the boy's band at a talent show.
