Bujji  and Chitti  are inseparable childhood friends. But when Bujji crashes Chitti's sandcastle by mistake ,Chitti gets angry and asks Bujji not to meet her for 12 years. She does, however, promise to marry him at the end of the lengthy hiatus, leaving Bujji but a glimmer of hope. After half-heartedly agreeing to her harsh terms, the forlorn Bujji leaves home, the pain of living in Visakhapatnam without seeing Chitti too much to bear. He winds up in Chennai, hence the tagline, Made in Chennai. He spends those dozen years in Chennai presumably like a 'goonda', as he is shown beating up people. Also, he spouts Tamil dialogues now and then, and is a great fan of Rajnikanth. When Bujji returns after 12 years, he foolishly beats up cops in mufti, and lands in jail. In jail, he encounters the sons of Machi Reddy , who give him Rs 1,00,00,000 to finish off Sivanna . But when Bujji tires to kill Sivanna, he is injured. Sivanna lets him stay at his house and uses him as his henchman. Only then does he learn that his long lost love, Chitti, is Sivanna's sister. Chitti is studying in London and her family is living in Hyderabad. She sends her sister Sanjana to contact Bujji. Bujji disguises his name as Rajini Kanth when he is treated there. Sivanna learns that his actual name is Bujji, but he asks him not to tell Chitti, because he is scared she might never want to see him again, since he was responsible for his wife's death. When Machi Reddy learns that he is part of Sivanna's gang, his son shoots Chitti and kidnaps Sanjana, and says to switch her for Sivanna . Will Sivanna live, or Bujji live? And will Chitti live or die?ΑΘήλά
