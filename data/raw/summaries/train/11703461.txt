Jim, a Chinese American Los Angeleno, borders on psychotic depression after he is abandoned by his bride-to-be two weeks before their Valentine's Day wedding. His only solution to end his misery is to get his best friend, Alex, an ex-con hitman, to promise to kill him. The two head for the hills, escaping to Jim's aunt's cabin, with the understanding Alex will fulfill his promise sometime before the approaching Hallmark holiday. With the plan in place, Jim finally seems at peace with his life... until he meets Amanda.
