In 1972 North Vietnam, short-timer Marines are dispatched by helicopter to conduct their last mission: to evacuate the survivors from a POW camp abandoned by the Viet Cong. The landing zone - which they expect to be cold - is actually hot  and after a short fight, only four members of the rescue mission survive. They cannot call for help, because their radio is destroyed in the firefight. The platoon they planned to meet the next day is wiped out, except for one psychotic, kill-happy white soldier, who joins them. Only two members of the company have combat experience (Private Hoover Branche  and Corporal Pippins . The surviving Marines conclude that they are expendable decoys, and as they strive to honor their dangerous assignment, scenes of the Marines' military experiences and their interactions with each other are interspersed with scenes of their civilian lives and  reasons for enlisting, told via flashbacks.
