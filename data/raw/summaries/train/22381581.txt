The film covers three days in the life of Hiram Jaffe , a would-be playwright who supplements his living as a porn writer and by walking dogs. He and his wife, Dolly , are moving to a new apartment on New York's Upper West Side. Jaffe is beset by problems, including his inability to persuade the moving man to move the couple's furniture, and retreats into fantasy.
