Near the end of the Korean War a new replacement, Private Loomis  is assigned to an infantry company in the front line. He notices a quiet Private Endore ([[John Saxon  and is warned by others in the company not to speak to him. Once night falls, Loomis notices Endore in black face and dark clothing infiltrating enemy lines to gather information and spread terror amongst the enemy by killing enemy soldiers with his knife. Endore's odd ritual of drawing a circle around the body with his knife may indicate that he is, in fact, a serial killer. Company Commander Captain Pratt  lets Endore act independently. Endore's only friend is a Korean orphan whom Loomis wishes to place in an orphanage that brings him into conflict with Endore. Tension increases when the armistice occurs and the others in the unit wish to return home to the United States, but Endore does not.
