A former RAF squadron leader, Matt Denant goes to Hendley, England to visit an airfield run by Titch, a friend. An employee there named Rodgers asks if he would kindly make a large wager for him on a horse. Denant does, but when the horse loses, Rodgers makes a promise to repay him. While strolling through Hyde Park, a woman strikes up a conversation with Matt, only to be charged with unlawful soliciting by Penter, a detective. Matt intervenes on her behalf, but when the two men fight, Penter's head strikes a park bench. Matt is placed under arrest. He is then sentenced to three years in prison after Penter dies. Believing it an unjust punishment, Matt escapes. Inspector Harris of Scotland Yard is assigned to find him, while Matt takes refuge in the home of Sir James Winton, whose daughter Dora helps him hide. A plane is left for Matt by his friend, enabling him to flee to France, but he is betrayed by Rodgers once it's learned the police are offering a reward. Matt's plane is caught in a heavy fog and crashes. He survives and takes refuge in a farm. Dora finds him and professes her love, also persuading Matt that he must turn himself in to the law.
