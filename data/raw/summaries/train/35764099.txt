A yellow taxi father, John, awaits the arrival of his new son, who looks just like him. Within his first few months, he is fed, changed, learns to "walk", gets his first "tooth" , etc. When his mother, Mary, a blue cab, mentions to him that he's going to grow up to be a taxi cab like his father, he shakes his head, then turns on the television to show an auto race, indicating that that's what he wants to be. This gets him sent to his room, where he basically goes about converting himself into a hot rod convertible. He comes out and zooms around the room, stopping in front of John, who, in disgust, checks out everything on him, then spanks him and sends him back to his room, demanding he go back to his taxi stuff. Instead, he sneaks out of his window, fuels up with high octane gas, then goes zooming all around town, spooking everything in his way. John chases after him, but can't seem to catch him, however, he gets his second wind when he sees Junior racing along side a train, playing chicken with it. After chasing him again, John runs out of gas right on the railroad track. Junior then zooms back and pushes him out of the way, but gets run over by the train. The next scene is at an auto repair garage, where Junior is being worked on like he's in surgery while John waits outside in tears . The "doctor" comes out to tell him Junior will be just fine, then after he comfort's him, is taken back out to make the decision of whether he wants Junior as a taxi cab or hot rod. John decides, due to Junior getting old enough to do so and for saving his life, to let him decide. He is stunned when Junior comes out as a taxi cab, but after they start rolling again, Junior winks at us and opens his hood to show the hot rod engine.
