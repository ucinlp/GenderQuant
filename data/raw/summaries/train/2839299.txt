The film begins with a woman running through the woods, who then falls into a stream and disappears. She is filed as a missing person. Meanwhile, four young campers, Craig, Peter, Ingrid, and Joanie back-pack through the mountains for a relaxing weekend in the wilderness. While they are hiking in broad daylight, someone starts killing tourists in the woods. Craig warns the others not to go into the woods alone. The mountains are crawling with nerdy bird-watchers and young couples, most of whom meet gruesome ends at the hands of a deranged and growling woodsman with a sharp spike. As their hike continues, the four campers enter a forest which becomes denser and darker as they progress. Peter  and Ingrid  fear that they are lost. The rest of the terrifying night is spent running and hiding from the maniac murderer  who is constantly in pursuit. Meanwhile, the local sheriff and his deputy decide they should start to investigate the disappearances.
