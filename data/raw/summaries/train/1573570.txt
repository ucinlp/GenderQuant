The main couple, childlike Candice Marie  and eccentric Keith , arrive at the campsite and pitch their tent in a quiet spot suitable for appreciating nature's wonders while keeping other human beings safely at arm's length. Their usual routine  is rudely interrupted by Ray ([[Anthony O'Donnell , a lone student who camps down nearby and switches on his radio which is treated by the couple as an unforgivable crime and they force Ray to turn it off. Later, on the way home after a trip to Stair Hole, it begins to rain and the couple notice a figure  walking along the road and give him a lift home. Their relationship becomes increasingly tense and tempers flare when Keith notices Candice Marie exhibiting an unseemly interest in Ray's well-being - "she crawls into his tent to show him stones she has collected on the beach; Keith explodes with jealous rage after spying on them from behind the bushes with his binoculars, like a character in a farce."Coveney, p.103 Later, Ray is asked to take a photograph of the couple but is patronised by Keith and Candice Marie and is forced to participate in a song at Keith's behest. As soon as some kind of order seems to have been restored, Brummie couple Finger and Honky arrive on their motorbike, equipped with an army tent, a football and a fondness for late-night drinking. Needless to say, Keith is tested to the limit. Finally, Keith and Candice Marie leave the campsite after an intense argument over Finger's plans to light a fire to cook some sausages. Keith highly objects to this, as it contravenes the rules of the site, and resorts to violence in order to stop it.
