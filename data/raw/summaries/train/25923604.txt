An adaption of Dylan Thomas's story, the comedy, set in South Wales, and filmed in the small mining town of Ferndale focuses on the character Owen's reminiscing on three separate Christmases, 1983, 1986 and 1989. Every Christmas Owen's uncle Huw , a successful but now divorced man, his son  Maurice, and Uncle Gorwell , an alcoholic and rather comedic character come to Owen's family house to stay. As we follow the family through the 1980s, the boys grow into men, whilst Owen's dad and his uncles seem to regress into childish behaviour and sibling rivalry. Owen's father Geraint  and his brothers Huw and Gorwell bicker and undermine each other and Owen's mum Brenda tries to stop everything falling to pieces. Despite all the petty rows and rivalries, eventually the members of the family learn to appreciate each other and realise Christmas wouldn't be the same without each other.{{cite web}}
