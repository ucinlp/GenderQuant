In 1963, an aging Philip Marlowe  is newly married to young socialite Laura Parker . The private investigator leaves his Los Angeles apartment behind and sets up a new base of operations in Poodle Springs, an upscale community in the desert a couple hours from L.A., where he and his wife intend to live. "I don't do divorces," Marlowe impatiently explains to potential clients in a peaceful, relatively crime-free town. His rich wife Laura would prefer that Philip get out of this line of work entirely and live off her money or come into business with P.J. Parker , her politically connected father, but Marlowe isn't ready to permanently hang up his gun. As might be expected, crime follows Marlowe wherever he may be. While looking into a matter at a gambling club just beyond the city limits, Marlowe sets out to find a photographer with a gambling debt and is soon mixed up in blackmail and murder. Larry Victor, the photographer , is a bigamist, two-timing Laura's wealthy friend Muffy  with a drug addict named Angel , and he is threatening to expose photos of a former stripper  who is now running with Muffy's billionaire father, Clayton Blackstone ([[Brian Cox . As things progress, Marlowe realizes that his new father-in-law is involved in a land swindle on such a massive scale that it could end up altering the California/Nevada state border. And any further snooping on the detective's part could quickly put an end to his wedded bliss.
