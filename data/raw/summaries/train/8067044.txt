Harry Moulton Pulham Jr.  is a conservative, middle-aged Boston businessman, set in a precise daily routine. He has a proper wife, Kay , with whom he has settled into a comfortable if passionless relationship. However, it was not always that way. When Harry is saddled with the task of organizing a twenty-five-year college reunion, it triggers a flashback to a time more than twenty years earlier. After the end of World War I, his Harvard classmate and friend Bill King  gets him a job in a New York City advertising company, where he falls in love with a vivacious, independent coworker oddly named Marvin Miles . However, though they love each other, she cannot bring herself to fit into his traditional idea of a wife's role and he cannot imagine living anywhere other than hidebound Boston. So they break off their relationship. Harry falls in love with and marries a woman from his own social set with the same attitudes and assumptions, someone approved of by his father  and mother . Marvin  arranges to meet Harry again after all those years. There are sparks and Harry is tempted to have an affair, but they both realize that it would be foolish. One thing changes though; Harry becomes profoundly dissatisfied with his dull routine. He begs his wife to go away with him immediately, to rekindle their love. At first, she dismisses the idea as impractical and vaguely improper, but then changes her mind and agrees to go with him, making him very happy..
