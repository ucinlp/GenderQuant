The cat is fishing in a pond. The fish may not catch the hooks, since he is lacking a worm as bait. The cat searches for a worm. A worm is trying avoid Foghorn and is almost cornered by both Foghorn and the cat but both chasers run into each other. Foghorn scolds the cat for chasing after his food and pushes him around. To get Foghorn out of the way, the cat disguises one of his fingers as a worm and lures Foghorn so that his head is caught under a hole in the fence and a whirling wheel operated by a fan splashes paint on his face. The cat chases the worm around a tractor and tries to send him out of the fuel line by blowing through the exhaust tail. Foghorn shows up and starts the tractor putting a lot of smoke in the cat's mouth. The cat tries to grab an axe, but Foghorn snatches it off him. The cat spots the worm and chases him. The cat puts his finger down a hole, but the worm bites it. As the cat tries to blow out the worm with a pump, Foghorn once again interrupts him and pushes him around. As Foghorn tries to blow out the worm, the cat grabs the worm and begins to fish. The worm is about to do his part by force, when Foghorn comes out of the pond, takes the worm and yet again scolds and pushes the cat around. Foghorn decides to divide the worm into two halves, but the worm will not cooperate. As Foghorn scolds and pushes the cat around for the last time, the cat fed up with Foghorn's non-stop chatter, tells him to shut up and slams him to the ground. Foghorn still continues talking after the cat walks off.
