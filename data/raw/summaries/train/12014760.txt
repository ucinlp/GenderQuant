The story begins with a girl named Asuka Matsuda, standing in front of a chicken's cage. As she watches the white chickens bullying the brown chicken, she cries and remembers being bullied by the boys, and even the girls of her class. A group of Japanese students go on a graduation trip to Korea. A girl they tormented and bullied back in Japan named Pam hung herself and a mysterious girl named Asuka is out for revenge. She forwards a cursed call to Azusa, the girl whose name Pam called out before she hung herself. The cursed call now includes a message saying that you can get a death exemption by forwarding it to someone else, forcing them to choose between being killed or condemning someone in their cell phone's memory to death. A girl named Emiri figures out who's behind the calls and tries to put a stop to it herself.
