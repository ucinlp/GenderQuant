The film tells the story of a man  who has discovered a global conspiracy against blind people, but can not prove or convince others. So he decides to write a report for the record, in case something happens . The film takes place in dark places, during the night, subways, basements, etc., and it is a clear metaphor for the violent dictatorship that ruled Argentina at that time, the self-styled National Reorganization Process .
