The film is set in 1901, and is based on events surrounding the growing Macedonian resistance to the Ottoman Empire. Resistance groups known as "Komiti" show the readiness of the Macedonian people to fight for freedom. At the same time different religious missions are trying to expand their influence among the people. Thessaloniki is the center of the American Protestant mission in Macedonia. The Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization  abducted U.S. Protestant missionary Miss Stone  led by Yane Sandanski  and his unit. The group demanded 25 pounds of gold to release her. They wanted her to sign the demand. She flatly refuses, but after going through several battles with Turkish forces, she stands on the side of guerrillas and signs the letter. The gold is eventually provided.
