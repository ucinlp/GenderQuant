Journey is the allegorical story of a young woman's struggle - outside the normal framework of space and time - to find herself. Found drifting down the Saguenay River, half-drowned and clinging to a log, a woman  is rescued by Boulder , who carries her to Undersky, his commune in the Qu√©bec wilderness. Named after the river from which she was saved, Saguenay is haunted by memories of her past and remains unresponsive for days, drifting in and out of consciousness. She gradually becomes aware of the life going on around her and begins to explore it. But she senses she has brought ill fortune to this community and fears something in her past has doomed her and all who know her. Finally, she journeys back up the river to confront the nightmare of her past. By doing so, she breaks through to the present and arrives at the mouth of the river.
