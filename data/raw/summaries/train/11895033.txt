Life in Chunni's village is all peace and quiet, and great fun. She fools the villagers including her parent with her impersonation of her twin sister, Munni. In the village, there is a mansion that is said to be haunted and legend goes that a witch called Makdee  resides there. The legend has it that whosoever wonders into the mansion, comes out as an animal! No one in the village dares enter the mansion. Things are going fine for Chunni until the day one of her pranks gets quite out of hand. As a result of this, Munni, her docile sister, enters the mansion, where the witch turns the little girl into a hen! Chunni is hysterical when she discovers this. She runs from pillar to post to get help, but her credibility is at an all-time low and the entire village refuses to believe her, so Chunni finally enters the haunted mansion alone to search for her sister. In the mansion she comes face to face with the witch, she pleads with the witch to let her poor little sister go, as it was no fault of hers. But the witch asks her to strike a deal. She will turn Munni back into a human only if Chunni can acquire for her hundred hens in exchange. All of a sudden, Chunni is confronted with the biggest challenge of her life. But somehow, down the line, she realises that all this was just a ruse. The witch can't really turn humans into animals, she merely locks them up. All the people locked up are finally freed and the village finds a new hero in Chunni
