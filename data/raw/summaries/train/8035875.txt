Angelique  is taken to an abortion clinic to end her pregnancy, the product of a demonic rape. However, her gun-toting father Dwayne  and three brothers are out to make sure the baby lives, after the father is given messages from “God” telling him to save the baby. In the end, Angelique gives birth to a demonic creature. The demon father  rises from the ground and kills some of the staff, one of the brothers, and Dwayne . The baby is shot in the head by Angelique, as the baby recognizes her as the mother, and then the demon father, seemingly grieving over its death, goes back to Hell with the corpse. Angelique then ends the episode by saying "God's will is done."
