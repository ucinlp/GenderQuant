Set during World War I, Lurk is transported from his role as a lowly servant in the household of Lord and Lady Twithampton  to the Western Front. Lurk is inspired to bravery, and upon receiving the German master plan for the entire war, which has through an unlikely series of events been tattooed onto his posterior, is pursued across France by German intelligence. After breaking into the British military headquarters to deliver the plans into the hands of General Burke , he is confronted by the sensuous German spy Mata Hari . After foiling Mata Hari's scheme to relieve him of the plan, a hilarious scene develops in which he is pursued by the nefarious Von Gutz  and his henchmen Donner and Blitzen . Accompanied by the Can-Can, performed by the Famous Buttercup Girls, Lurk is pursued around the Allied headquarters. Finally, disguised as a tree, he is able to present the plans to General Burke, to the famous line: General Burke: "Lurk, bend down." Lurk: "I thought you'd never ask!" Having successfully delivered the plans into the hands of British intelligence, Lurk receives a medal of honour and a promotion. He is therefore able to win the love of his beloved Fanny  and defeat the machinations of the wicked Sgt. Major Groping . There is also a cameo by a young Bob Hoskins.
