A group of American Tourists go to India in search of enlightenment. The main character in the film is group leader Laurie Handlers, a larger-than-life guru from New York City who practices and teaches tantra and leads a small group of travelers on their first trip to India. The film is a classic mythical journey with the characters learning from their travels. Although superficially the film may appear to be a mockumentary, all participants are real people and nothing was staged in the filming. As such the film can be termed a fly-on-the-wall film and has been compared to This Is Spinal Tap for its outrageous and hilarious characters.
