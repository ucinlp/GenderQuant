A rare collection of artifacts from an archeological dig in Egypt are brought to the famous Mus√©e du Louvre in Paris. While experts are using a laser scanning device to determine the age of a sarcophagus, a ghostly spirit escapes and makes its way into the museum's electrical system. Museum curator Faussier  brings in a noted Egyptologist, Glenda Spencer , to examine the findings, and she announces that the mummy inside the coffin was actually the evil spirit Belphegor. Meanwhile, a young woman named Lisa  who lives across the street from the museum follows her runaway cat into the Louvre after closing time. She is accidentally given a shock that sends the stray spirit into her body. Soon Lisa is disguising herself as Belphegor and making off with the rare Egyptian treasures on display at the museum, convinced that they are rightfully hers. When Belphegor proves more than a match for the Louvre's security forces, renowned detective Verlac  is brought out of retirement to find out why the museum's Egyptian collection has been shrinking.
