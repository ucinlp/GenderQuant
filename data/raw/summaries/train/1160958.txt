Dr Ram Prasad Ghayal  is a surgeon whose scalpel proves to be a magic wand. He lives with his wife Janaki  and brother Bharat. Bharat is in love with a dancing doll Renu  whom the baddie's brother Deepak  also loves. Bharat, an architect refuses to sign a power project involving heavy kickbacks and heavier displacement. He is implicated in a plot and sent to jail. Unable to bear this humiliation, he commits suicide and Renu marries Deepak instead of repenting her beloved's loss. Now is the time for our 'Mrityudaata' to avenge the loss of his wife and his brother. He trades his scalpel for a machine gun and apron for a commando coat and cap. In the last moment Dr. Ram died and was in the position to die, because there was no one who could help him.
