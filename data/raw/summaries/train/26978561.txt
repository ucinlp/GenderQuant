 The film begins in June 1941. Five years have passed since the lives and destinies of General Kotov, his wife Maroussia, their daughter Nadia, as well as those of Mitia and the Sverbitski family, were irrevocably changed: it has meant five years of incarceration for General Kotov , the former Revolutionary hero betrayed by Stalin. He escapes certain death in the Gulag and fights on the Eastern Front as a private. It has been five years of terror for his wife Maroussia, without the husband she believes is dead and with a daughter who has rejected her. Nadia has spent five years in hiding, proud of her father whom she refuses to disown and whom she believes is alive, despite all reports to the contrary. Mitya  survived his suicide attempt, and reluctantly continues to execute the orders of a regime he holds in contempt. Stalin, with his nation under attack by former ally Adolf Hitler, recalls many of those whom he has had executed or exiled to the GULAG. He tries to mobilize the Soviet population - by any means necessary - to rise against the threat of Nazism.  {{Expand section}}
