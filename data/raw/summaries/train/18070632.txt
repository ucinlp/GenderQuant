A handful of soldiers are faced with the ultimate temptation, which affects their ethical standards in different ways. Perlaza , Lloreda , Venegas  and Porras  are four servicemen in the Colombian Army who are part of a counter-guerilla unit dedicated to ferreting out revolutionaries who have set up camp in the nation's jungles. Porras is married and a dedicated family man, while the others are single and like to party hard when they are not on duty. While cleaning up after an ambush by guerillas, one of the soldiers makes a surprising discovery â€” several tubs buried in the jungle which hold $40 million in cash, hidden by drug kingpins in cahoots with the guerillas. While Porras predictably maintains they should leave the money alone and tell their commander Lizarazo  about it, the others want to take the fortune for themselves. However, hiding $40 million from Lizarazo proves to be a difficult task, and spending the money without drawing attention to themselves is not much easier.
