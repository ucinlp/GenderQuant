A young woman, Mette, is a member of a neo-Nazi gang, while her day job is to take care of four crazy old people that all are just waiting to die. Her life becomes a journey into a burlesque fairytale, where the rules of the game are created by Mette herself. Mette is indifferent about her way of life, until one night she assaults a man, kicking him senseless. Waking up the day after, she realizes that something is wrong, and in company with her crazy oldies she longs for respect and love. She can tell that the old folks are marginalized by the modern society, but together they create a world and a voice of their own.
