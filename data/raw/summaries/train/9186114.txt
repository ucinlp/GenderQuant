Set sometime after the events of the previous film, Haji Bakhil's wife has died. Haji Bakhil is alone and depressed, but eventually meets a beautiful young woman named Murni, who is a teacher at a school for orphans. Haji Bakhil spends some time pursuing her, and his attention is apparently not unwelcome. In a subplot, Labu and Labi discover that they are both in love with Haji Bakhil's daughter Manisah, and decide to fight for her properly in a boxing match. However, this thread is not resolved by the end credits, and the pair's feud is not addressed after their failed boxing match. In the main plot, Haji Bakhil eventually sends Labu and Labi on his behalf to Murni's house to ask her father for her hand in marriage, but Murni's father refuses. Labu and Labi come up with a plan to kidnap Murni in the middle of the night for an elopement, but they accidentally kidnap Murni's father, instead. Labu, Labi and Haji Bakhil are arrested and tried. Haji Bakhil is able to post his own bail, but he refuses to bail his servants. The film ends with Labu and Labi moaning their fate in prison.
