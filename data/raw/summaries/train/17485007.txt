Aamir is set in the Muslim-dominated streets and poor living conditions of people living in residential pockets of old Mumbai. The protagonist's  family has been kidnapped by a radical mafia group, who want him to carry out a bombing in the city. The kidnappers try to gain Aamir's sympathy by showing him the "plight" of some Muslims in modern India, but Aamir resists saying that such an attack is un-Islamic and will only make things worse for the community. Rajeev Khandelwal is in lead role whose performance was appreciated after releasing of film.
