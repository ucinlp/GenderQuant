A Bosnian poet  lived with his family in Sarajevo during the hard times in the horrific siege of the city. The war in Bosnia was raging all around them. After sending his wife  and daughter  to Croatia, he found at home two orphans Adis and Kerim, who escaped a massacre in their own village. They escaped from their village and came to Sarajevo in search of their aunt, which lived in the neighborhood called Bistrik. Hamza decided to help the boys by shielding them from the horrors of war. Together they fight for survival in this horrible war and the ongoing complete siege of the city. After a long search, Hamza discovers that the aunt of Adis and Kerim was a refugee in Germany. Upon learning this Hamza tries to save the kids by sending them out of the war zone. But the only way out was trough the Sarajevo International Airport, which is a very dangerous passage occupied and monitored by Chetniks and their death squads as well as snipers. In many scenes Hamza is seen with the two kids speaking monologues, while observing photos of his wife and daughter. All the poetry cited in the film by Hamza are verses written by Abdulah Sidran, renowned Bosnian writer and poet.
