When he uses shaolin iron vest  technique, as to not feel the principal's punches, the principal makes him stay on the streets for one night without dinner. He demonstrates his incredible accuracy to a down-and-out hustler, Wang Li by throwing cans into a bin almost ten metres away. Wang tells him, that if he can throw a coin into his mouth from twenty metre's away, he would treat him to dinner. They go to a five star French restaurant, where Wang Li's daughter works, and eat leftovers. Li convinces Shi Jie to help them make some money for themselves. After eating, they go to a Casino owned by one of Wang Li's old friend's son, Brother Hu. There, Shi Jie wins hundreds of dollars playing darts. The resulting fight causes thousands of dollars worth of damage. The next morning, before school starts, Bi Tianhao, the principal of Fireball University puts the principal of the kung fu school onto his paylist. Then, after a massive beating by Bi Tianhao's thugs, Shi Jie is expelled. The next night, Shi Jie is once again sitting on the park bench where he met Wang Li, who is still there. On the pretext of helping him search for his family, Wang Li invites him to play basketball at 'First University' as the new star of its basketball team. Meanwhile, Wang Li capitalizes on media interest in Shi-Jie to make money via interviews and news articles. After joining the basketball team, Shi-Jie finds that Li-Li   whom he had admired for a long time is the sister of Ting Wei , the leader of the basketball team. Shi Jie is desperate to draw her attention. Therefore, he attempts to compete with Xiao Lan , who is Li-Li's idol. The competition between Shi Jie and Xiao Lan generates an unstable atmosphere within the team. After Ting Wei counsels Shi Jie, the basketball team becomes more unified. Meanwhile, he helped Shi Jie combine his foundation of Kung-Fu skills into basketball techniques, which in turn brings his skills into full play and helps the team win many rounds of the inter-varsity tournament. By the time of the finals, the major competitor faced by Shi Jie and his team members is the team of Fireball University, led by Li Tian. Li used to be on the First University basketball team alongside Ting Wei and Xiao Lan, but became arrogant and was lured to their competitor's camp. The competing team composed of players who had been banned from all basketball games in Japan. Fireball University also bribed the referee of the final game. Although Wang Li had enlisted the aid of Shi Jie's kung-fu teachers, the opposing team had put in place a number of measures to prevent First University from winning, up to and including injuring First University's star players Shi-Jie, Ting Wei and Xiao Lan. Thus, due to both unscrupulous fouls from the opposing team and the referee's biased decisions and outright interference by punching out the last ball that Shi Jie throws, First University is defeated. Unwilling to admit defeat to such unjust conditions, Shi Jie recalls a technique his first teacher had utilized, and manages to turn back the clock to the time just before Shi Jie is to make his last throw of the game. Given a second chance and instead of trying to make the same last throw which will be interfered by the referee again, Shi Jie decides to pass to Ting Wei, who in turn dunks it past Li Tian into the basket. Eventually, First University wins fair and square. After the game Shi Jie discovered that his dad is the richest man in Asia. He later visits his dad, and discovers that he was abandoned for his safety during a difficult financial time of his father's life. His dad insisted that he go to London to expand his future. Later that night Shi Jie decided to stay with Wang Li instead, who later suggested for him to show his skills in an event greater than any basketball match - the Olympic Games.
