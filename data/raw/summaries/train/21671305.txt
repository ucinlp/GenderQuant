20-year-old Sarena's  world is picture perfect &mdash; she has an adorable relationship with her industrialist father Vivek Devan  and is on the verge of major stardom as a pop singer. Jai's  world is poles apart. As the struggling editor of a near-bankrupt tabloid, he dreams of one day having an office in pricey Nariman Point. He searches for a sensational story that'll get him there. Jai stumbles upon the secret that pop star Sarena is not the real daughter of industrialist Vivek Devan, who had taken great pains to ensure that no one knew she was adopted. Jai realises that this could be the story he was looking for and goes ahead and publishes it, thus incurring the wrath of Vivek Devan. An enraged Vivek Devan takes legal action against the errant journalist, and he tries to suppress any further information being leaked. Sarena, however, notices her father's anxiety and confronts him, only to discover that Jai, despite his crude ways of going about it, had written the truth. Ignoring her father's protests, Sarena goes in search of her mother. At every stage, her companion in her mission is Jai, who follows her through the journey from Mumbai to Ooty to get the legal notice withdrawn. With no headway in her search, Sarena seeks Jai's help, inspired by his go-getting ways. As Sarena discovers layer upon devastating layer of truth behind her identity, Jai too learns many things about life. On the trip, they fall in love. When Sarena meets her mother, she is glad, but her mother doesn't seem pleased. She rejects Sarena by stating that she doesn't have a daughter. It turns out that Sarena's mother was raped by a police officer, and Sarena was the product of that disastrous event. Horrified by the truth, Sarena teams up with Jai to fix the injustice done to her mother. All ends well, as Sarena's mother is able to get justice, the police inspector gets arrested, and Sarena and Jai get married.
