In Montreal’s Mile End, Adam Levy, a Jewish teenager, falls in love with Yasmine Gibran, a Lebanese girl… On his way to audition for music school, Adam meets Yasmine, who is participating in a student protest. When the demonstration gets out of hand, they are thrown together in the rush to evacuate the school. He might have missed his audition, but instead he’s met the girl of his dreams! Adam, handsome and shy, and Yasmine, exquisite and passionate, are instantly drawn to one another. Their love grows, but complications arise. Adam fears that his orthodox Rabbi grandfather, who he’s lived with since his parents were killed in Israel, will stop at nothing to end his relationship with “the Arab girl”. The renewed conflict in the Middle East feels closer and closer to home, as Yasmine’s life dives into a tailspin when she learns that her mother has gone missing in bombarded Beirut. The young lovers’ fight to stay together proves more difficult by the day. The deeper they fall for each other, the more their families feel betrayed.
