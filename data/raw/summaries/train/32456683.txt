Otto Brosowski, a communist miner, writes to the miners in the Soviet city of Krivoy Rog, telling them of the harsh conditions in which he and his friends work, as the capitalist owners of the copper mine demand harder work. He receives a Red Banner from them. As the Nazis seize power, Otto and his family hide the flag from the authorities, taking great personal risks. At 1945, as the Second World War nears its end, the town is occupied by the Americans, who also wish to steel the Banner. At July 1945, as the Americans retreat and allow the Red Army to take over the area, the Brosowski family takes the flag and heads to meet the Soviets.
