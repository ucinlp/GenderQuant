Kunjoottan  is an innocent young man living in a remote village. He is the only heir to his rich, aristrocratic parents, Thamburan and Kunjulakshmi. He cannot stand his overprotective father, who is concerned about his son because he had a bad dream about his son's death. The family astrologer Panikker confirms this and predicts that it will be difficult for Kunjoottan to survive the age of 30 and that he is in great danger from motor vehicles. Worried Thamburan hires two ex-Mahouts Valiya Raman Nair and Cheriya Raman Nair to protect Kunjoottan, which further annoys him. Enter Ramachandran, a childhood friend. He is back from town with colourful stories about city life. He is in urgent need of money to pay his debts from a failed business. He tricks Kunjoottan into stealing money from his father's safe so that they can run away and enjoy life in the city. By the time Kunjoottan discovers his friend's true intentions, he loses all his money to tricksters in the city. Ramachandran tries to get rid of Kunjoottan since his innocence was landing both in trouble. Later, they kidnap a girl named Asha  whose stepfather M.R.C  had hired three men to kill her. After learning about her sad past, both Rama and Kunjoottan decide to help her instead. But Kunjoottan's father is hell-bent on finding his son. Asha's father hires a professional killer named Christopher Luke  to kill Asha. After a series of comic mishaps, the killer is captured by police inspector Abu Hassan and Kunjoottan reunites with his father.
