 Django  is a drifter who drags around a coffin that conceals a machine gun. He rescues a young woman, María , from being murdered by bandits led by Major Jackson , a man whom Django is seeking revenge on for the murder of his wife. After killing most of Jackson's men, Django makes a deal with a Mexican bandit general, Hugo Rodriguez , who is in conflict with Jackson, and the two steal a large quantity of gold from a Mexican Army fort . When Rodriguez drags his feet in giving Django his share, he and Maria steal the gold. Unfortunately, the gold falls into quicksand. When Rodriguez catches up to them, María is shot  and Django's hands are crushed. Rodríguez and his men are massacred by Jackson and the Mexican Army when the bandits return to Mexico. Jackson then goes looking for Django in a cemetery after killing Nathaniel. However, Django, who has bitten the trigger-guard off his pistol, kills Jackson and his five surviving men by pressing the trigger against a cross  and repeatedly dropping the hammer.
