Om-Dar-Ba-Dar is a portrait of life in a mythical small town. The film tells the story of a young boy called Om in the period of his carefree adolescence and its harsh disillusionments. The story starts like a comedy and ends like a thriller. Om has a rather strange family. His father Babuji, a government employee, leaves his job so that he can dedicate himself to astrology; Om's older sister Gayatri is dating a good-for-nothing. Om is involved in science, but is also attracted to magic and religion. Above all it seems as if his really outstanding skill is his ability to hold his breath for a long time.
