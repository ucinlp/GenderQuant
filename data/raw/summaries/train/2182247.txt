The title of the film is taken from Bentley's alleged cry of "Let him have it, Chris!" shortly before Christopher Craig shot and wounded the first policeman on the scene. Crown prosecutors suggested that Bentley meant "Go ahead and shoot him," whilst Frank Cassells for the defence argued that he meant "Give him the gun" . Craig was sentenced to gaol "at Her Majesty's pleasure", and spent ten years there. He has been a law abiding citizen ever since. Derek Bentley's father bought an expensive bottle of wine in 1958 to celebrate their victory should Derek be proved innocent. However, Bentley's parents never got to drink it. His father William Bentley died on 12 July 1974 and his mother died on 10 October 1976. The film's end titles state that Bentley's sister, Iris, was still fighting for his pardon, however seven years after the film was made and after numerous unsuccessful campaigns to get Derek Bentley a full pardon, his conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal on 30 July 1998. However, Bentley's sister had also died by this point.'Craig's relief at Bentley Pardon' BBC, 30th July 1998
