This romance is set in Tyrol, western Austria. Previously filmed in 1928, the sentimental Margaret Kennedy novel The Constant Nymph was sumptuously remade by Gaumont-British Picture Corporation in 1933. Victoria Hopper plays the title character, a rich, Belgian gamine named Tessa Sanger. The girl falls hopelessly in love with world-famous composer Lewis Dodd , who is so full of himself that he barely acknowledges Tessa's existence. As she looks on in quiet desperation, Dodd marries another woman, his distant cousin Florence . It takes him nearly the entire picture to realize what a fool he's been, and that Tessa was the one girl for him all along -- but alas, it's too late. The Constant Nymph was remade by Warner Bros. in 1943, at which time all prints of the 1933 version were supposed to be destroyed, however, several prints did survive.http://www.allmovie.com/work/the-constant-nymph-130614
