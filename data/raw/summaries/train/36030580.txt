A talented young Jamie Harris is a struggling actress who is trying to win a role in an upcoming film called "Playmaker". Eager to gain advantage on the competition, Harris' friend Eddie says that he can arrange an introduction with Ross Talbert, an acting teacher with a reputation for grooming top talent. Talbert agrees to tutor Harris for $5,000; she scrapes up the money, only to discover that his lessons are mainly exercises in psychological abuse. Harris learns that a number of Talbert's students who didn't respond to his techniques have turned up dead, and she spies an "F" next to her name in his grade book shortly before he attacks her with a knife; she grabs a gun and kills him. The police determine that Jamie acted in self-defense - but the man who she's been taking lessons with wasn't the real Ross Talbert. As the police arrive at the scene a different corpse is lying dead on the ground, which seems to be the real teacher. As a result, she tries to find the false teacher, and discovers that he was just an actor like herself, named Michael Condren, and that she is just a puppet on a string in a perverse and bizarre story.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110849/plotsummary<ref namehttp://www.allmovie.com/movie/playmaker-v132313 |titleAllMovie |date2012-06-03}}
