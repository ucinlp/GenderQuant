Two soldiers have been robbed and murdered while guarding a shipment of gold. Into town rides Haven, a military intelligence officer traveling incognito. A beautiful saloon singer catches Haven's eye. After he meets Mrs. Caslon, who owns the gold mine, Haven hears that someone called "Charlie" is the brains behind the scenes. He finds out to his surprise that Charlie is the singer. Charlie's lawyer, Bristow, is $6,000 in her debt and therefore might be involved in the gold theft. Haven beats up Charlie's saloon bouncer in a fight and is offered a job as transport chief for the gold. On the stagecoach, driver Goddard is killed and Haven knocked cold. Bristow comes to kill him, but Haven gets the upper hand. Bristow is shot by men named Prince and Marion. After persuading the sheriff to arrest him for the crime, Haven escapes, shoots Marion and learns that Charlie's men plan to disguise themselves as military officers to steal more of Mrs. Caslon's gold. Prince sneaks up intending to shoot Haven, but his bullet hits Charlie instead. Haven does away with Prince and rushes to Charlie's side. She tells Haven she loves him before dying in his arms.
