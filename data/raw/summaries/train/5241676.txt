An enigmatic swordsman named Nomad , wanders through the remains of a post-World War III world. He travels the desert, in search of his mentor's killer, the assassin Sho . The war itself is never described, but there are hints that a new government rose soon afterwards. Nomad had a position of privilege as a soldier and as part of the elite guard assigned with protecting the upper heads of the new government. Since firearms are no longer available, edged weapons have been revived as the standard fighting tools. The elite guard mastered the use of swords and carried them in an unusual, upright fashion. Eventually, the post-war government collapsed as well and Nomad retired to run a farm with his family. Nomad runs into a group of settlers in the town of Meridian. Damnil , a local landowner, and his gang are attacking the town to gain a monopoly on the local water supply. Nomad stays at a local farm owned by Kasha  who is Nomad's love interest . Nomad teams up with Kasha's foreman Tark to become Meridian's "peacekeepers" to defend the town against Damnil and his forces, as well as giving him the opportunity to revenge his mentor's death at the hands of Sho.
