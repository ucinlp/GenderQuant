On a remote Pacific island with a newly constructed luxury resort, oil rigger Hank Anderson's scientists are warning him that a nearby active volcano is about to erupt. Shelby Gilmore, who owns the hotel, is not sure how concerned to be, while Bob Spangler, who runs it, ignores all warnings and assures guests that the volcano's threat is a total exaggeration. Anderson and love interest Kay Kirby organize a getaway to a safe side of the island, but Spangler persuades many of the hotel's guests not to go, including his mistress Iolani and his wife Nikki, and they pay for it with their lives when the volcano does indeed blow. A small band of survivors head for higher ground. Among them are Rene and Rose Valdez, long-ago circus tightrope performers, the hotel's general manager Brian who is in fact the younger half-brother of Spangler, Sam and Mona, a bar owning couple from the town, and Francis Fendly, an embezzler being tailed by Tom Conti, a private investigator. Conti is blinded during the volcano's eruption, so Fendly becomes his personal guide. Some of the survivors do not make it. Rose Valdez dies from a weak heart and during the crossing of a rickety bridge some inevitably fall into the boiling lava below. Rene Valdez recreates his tightrope act carrying a child and saves the boy's life. Ultimately Anderson, Kirby and a few more are able make it to the island's other side safely.
