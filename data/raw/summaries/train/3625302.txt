All three variants of the film show Robbie, a young boy of about 10 years old with a keen interest in both trains and football, being persuaded by his elder brother to climb through a hole in the fence surrounding a nearby railway line and go onto the track. The three different editions continue as follows: * Version 1 : As he is walking along the railway line, Robbie gets the laces of his football boots caught in the track, and desperately tries to pull his feet free. We then hear and see a train approaching. The shoelace then pops and Robbie stumbles back in time, but trips on the other tracks, then we hear and see another train approaching. In the next scene, Robbie is now in a wheelchair because he got hit by the train and had to have both feet amputated. He is watching some other children play football, with a commentary by the narrator about how he'll never be able to play again. The final shot is of his football boots hanging up on the back of his bedroom door at home. * Version 2 : While the children are playing, Robbie's brother snatches his football boots and throws them. They land near an electricity pylon, and Robbie tries to retrieve them with a long metal pole, but is electrocuted. * Version 3 : Robbie accidentally steps on the electrified third rail, and is electrocuted. <!--
