A crew of Reapers, whose job is to extract souls of people who are about to die, find themselves confronted by change as their habitual meeting place  burns down on the same day that their boss and head reaper  disappears . They soon meet their new boss, Cameron Kane , a slick businessman who died falling from the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. He outfits them with color-coordinated smartphones and treats them to luxurious accommodations, teaching them as Roxy  puts it later, "nothing we do here matters". This tutelage leads the Reapers to perform such misdeeds as saving those they were to Reap , abusing immortality for financial gain , letting a soul wander, instead of showing him "his lights" , and otherwise selfishly focusing on their wants.<ref name Herek, Stephen  | title  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1079444/ | medium  Metro Goldwyn Mayer | location  2009 }} Georgia "George" Lass , the movie's narrator, is fired from Happy Time when, after she loudly chews out an employee for delivering a report late, the employee quits and sues for harassment. George ends up admitting her identity to her sister Reggie . Despite Reggie casually believing herself mad, George finds herself reminiscing with Reggie, helping her prepare for the death of her boyfriend Hudson , and eventually convincing her not to kill herself. At the launch, Delores tells George that the employee who had sued her for harassment had done so at several of her previous jobs, and George is reinstated, now with a corner office. The Reapers walk away from the launch, wondering who their new boss is; the movie closes with George finding herself suddenly showered with Post-Its magically falling from the sky, like the Post-Its their former leader Rube used to deliver their Reaps. Realizing she's been selected as the group's new leader, she says "I am so fucked" as the camera pulls away from the Earth into orbit.
