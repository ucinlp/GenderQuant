The film depicts the inside of a tank, and the view from inside through the gunsight . The film is set during the 1982 Lebanon war. There are four Israeli soldiers inside: the driver in the tank's hull, the loader, the gunner and the commander in the turret. Part of the time, there is also the body of a dead Israeli soldier , a Syrian POW, a visiting higher officer, and a visiting Phalangist  who threatens the POW. The duty of the soldiers is to clear a Lebanese area from Lebanese citizens. They are instructed to use phosphorus grenades that are forbidden by international treaty, but to use a code word for them, to conceal their use. The gunner has never fired the tank's cannon in a war situation, and is hesitant at first. As a result, a fellow Israeli soldier is killed. The soldiers have to cope with the deteriorating state of the tank, the heat, bad atmosphere and small space inside, occasional failure of the communication equipment, navigational problems, and mutual quarrels.
