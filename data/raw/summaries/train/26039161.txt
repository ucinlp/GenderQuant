A boss and his employees go on an excursion to Cheung Chou, an island off the coast of Hong Kong. The stingy boss rents a building for its low rental rate, even though he is aware that people had died there from unnatural causes before. He meets a young woman and courts her, despite not knowing anything about her past. Meanwhile, the employees encounter abnormal events while enjoying themselves and they suspect that the woman might be linked to those strange events.
