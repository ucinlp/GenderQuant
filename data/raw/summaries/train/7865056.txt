Jack Murphy , a hardened, antisocial LAPD detective, frequently escapes the harsh reality that his ex-wife  has become a stripper and his career is going nowhere by drinking. His world is turned upside down, however, when he is framed by ex-convict Joan Freeman  for putting her in prison earlier in his career. Freeman murders the detective's ex-wife and begins killing off his associates while framing him for the crimes. The same police force he works for places him under arrest with Arabella McGee , a petty thief he locked away. Murphy escapes from jail while still handcuffed to McGee and they pursue the real killer.
