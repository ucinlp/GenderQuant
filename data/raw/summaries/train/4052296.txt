The story is about a young Jewish boy from a small Manitoba community who has an overbearing family. To make matters more difficult, he likes a Christian girl, whom he later competes with in a piano competition. A fun-loving rabbi tries to help him with his problems. The movie was filmed in Winnipeg and rural Manitoba.
