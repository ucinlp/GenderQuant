Montana is on the brink of statehood, but in need of law and order. John Malvin witnesses the murder of a miner and his son by men who turn out to be Yeager, Ives and Gimp. He learns later that Ives is a deputy to the sheriff, Henry Plummer. What he doesn't know is that Plummer is secretly behind these and other recent murders. Malvin accepts a job as Plummer's deputy. He also meets and falls in love with Clair Enoch, the daughter of Possum Enoch, who runs the stage relay depot. Plummer gets rid of Yeager, then asks Malvin to take his place guarding businessman Jason Waterman's money shipment on the stage. Clair and Possum warn him that bandits will attack the stage. Malvin is angered by suggestions that Plummer's behind all this. When the crimes continue, Clair organizes a vigilante group. Malvin remains against them until Plummer's attempt to kill Clair provides conclusive proof. He confronts the sheriff and places him under arrest.
