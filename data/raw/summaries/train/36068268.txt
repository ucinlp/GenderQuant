Ironically, while the faithful Krishna has a very suspicious Kaajal as his wife, playboy Prem has a trusting wife Pooja. And there is Sunny's-to-be wife Sanjana, who is a bit of both. Trouble brews when Prem decides to make Krishna taste the forbidden fruit that he loves so much. This forbidden fruit assumes the form of sultry Bobby, who walks through the board right into the lives of them all, leading to chaos, craziness, commotion and crisis. {{cite web}}
