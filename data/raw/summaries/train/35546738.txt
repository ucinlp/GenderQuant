Concerned about the future of the U.S., Knapp heads to Washington D.C. to address his problems. When he had difficulties accomplishing his goals, he decided to alter his strategy and to pursue his own earmark. Knapp hired a lobbyist and set out to obtain government funding for his project, which was to construct a museum of government waste. The idea for the project came from filmmakers Ellen and Jim Hubbard asking themselves "why can't Congress get a handle on wasteful spending?," "how could we become a part of the process to see how and why Congress makes spending decisions?," and “what’s the ultimate ridiculous earmark that we can come up with?’”<ref namePappas|firstTheDC Exclusive: Documentary filmmakers try to get government funding for ‘Museum of Government Waste’|url19 April 2012|newspaper5 March 2012}} Knapp spoke privately with people from members of Congress, to their staff, to lobbyists, in order to get an idea of what goes on outside the public eye.
