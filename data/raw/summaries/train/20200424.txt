My Friends Told Me About You charts the journey of a man at the beginning of a downward spiral. Paranoia, confusion, and anger start to color all that he knows to be true and as reality blurs with his subconscious fears, an alternate world propelled by violence and mistrust begins to take over. As sonic as it is visual, Dengler also composed the original score for My Friends Told Me About You in collaboration with acclaimed English clarinetist Ian Mitchell.{{cite web}}
