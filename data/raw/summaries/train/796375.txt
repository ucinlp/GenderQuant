During the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, surgeon Dr. Franticek Svoboda , a Czech patriot, assassinates the brutal "Hangman of Europe", Reichsprotektor Reinhard Heydrich , and is wounded in the process. In his attempt to escape, he is helped by history professor Stephen Novotny , who is himself under suspicion by the Nazis, and his daughter Mascha . As retaliation for the assassination, fifth-columnist Emil Czaka , a brewer, helps to arrange for 400 citizens of Prague, including Professor Novotny, to be executed if the assassin is not named. Through a complex series of events, the resistance manages to frame Czaka himself for the murder, but not before the Nazis have executed many of the hostages.
