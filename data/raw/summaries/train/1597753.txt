Tom White  is an architect who then chooses to make himself homeless. Outwardly, he has all the signs of a successful life—large home, loving family, successful career. However, it soon becomes clear that not everything is as it appears at work. Tom chooses a different path and cuts ties with his normal life. He has chosen the streets, where those he meets, in spite of their position, have enormous self-dignity—the rent boy , an ex-junkie , a gentle-but-manly tramp  and a 14-year-old graffiti artist . Tom goes on a personal journey of his own as he plumbs outsider society, yet he discovers his own dignity and gains an understanding of who he is.
