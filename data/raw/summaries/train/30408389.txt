The film follows a three women who deeply inhabit their cinematic roles as social workers interacting with members of a impoverished rural Argentine neighborhood. Facing poverty, the three move into makeshift living quarters in a run down hospital. They then begin the work of recording data on the needs of the community and getting to know each other, while trying to make their living quarters habitable, and still find time for an occasional night out.
