Kim Seong-yeol is a yuppie Detective in Homicide with the Seoul police. A year ago, he had an affair with his colleagueâ€™s wife and, slightly drunk on his way back from meeting her, he causes his daughter's death in a car accident. Wracked with guilt but unable to explain what happened on that day, he is no longer on speaking terms with his wife, Ji-yeon, who obviously blames him for their only child's death. One day, Ji-yeon goes out all dressed up but comes home unexpectedly dishevelled and with blood splatters on her blouse but refusing to explain herself. Seong-yeol is called out to investigate the murder of a man with gang connections where he is horrified to find trace evidence that hints at his wife's presence at the scene. He assumes that his wife is connected to the murder, and does all he can to keep her from being identified as a suspect. When a mystery man contacts him, claiming to know Ji-yeon is involved and asking for money, the situation is made worse by Ji-yeon refusing to tell him anything at all.
