In Paris, Pepe is strolling and causing a disturbance with his fumes. At one point Penelope is walking with a ginger cat and Pepe's stink causes the ginger cat to faint and Penelope to spring in the air getting her back on a fresh white-painted flagpole before she falls right into Pepe's arms. As Pepe introduces himself, Penelope scurries away. Pepe chases Penelope into the Louvre, the ginger cat following. Pepe's stench ruins a couple of sculptures as well as thwarting the ginger cat's ambush attempt and he terrifies Penelope in the sculpture galley, even as he paints her picture, she scurries away again. The ginger cat pumps himself with air in an attempt to hold his breath while he confronts Pepe. Pepe plays along the confrontation as a duel, miming a miss and a defeat. The ginger cat in the meantime suffocates and puffs out all the air he held in, launching himself into the Hall d'Armour. Pepe wonders where everyone has gone to and immediately picks up on where Penelope went. Pepe finds Penelope hiding in the Air Conditioning machine and traps her in it with himself. Pepe's fumes spread through the Louvre spoiling various works of art .
