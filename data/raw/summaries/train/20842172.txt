When she was 13, Holly told a mall Santa Claus that she would like to have a boyfriend for Christmas. Twenty years later, Holly is a romantic skeptic and is more focused on her career as a social worker. At the time, she is in court helping a mother get her children back from foster care. When the mother's lawyer  does not show up in court, Holly is extremely angry and sends the lawyer a letter via her secretary. On Christmas Day, she opens her door to a man carrying a Christmas tree and a bow on his chest. He hands her a note that says, "As promised, one boyfriend for Christmas," and introduces himself as Douglas Firwood. She assumes he is a gag present from her friend Diane, and invites him to her own home. Later that day she takes him with her to her parents' house for Christmas dinner. Hoping to keep her matchmaking family off her back, she tells everyone that Douglas is her long-term boyfriend, and Douglas plays along. On New Year's Eve, Holly learns that Douglas is really Ryan Hughes, who was sent to her by Santa Claus. She accuses him of lying to her and tells him to leave. After persuasion by Santa Claus, she follows Ryan and they watch the New Year's fireworks together.
