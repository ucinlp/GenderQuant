Three people are stranded in the desert after Matt  and Eddie  total Tuesday's  automobile. Tuesday is a drop dead gorgeous girl; however, much to the guysâ€™ dismay, she is revealed as a lesbian, albeit sensitive and fun-loving. She is a woman with ambition and Matt and Eddie - two jokers - are far from impressionable in her eyes. Exhibiting an immediate sexual interest in the beautiful Tuesday, the guys are certain they can change her.
