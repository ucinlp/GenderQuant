At the beginning of the film, D.M.C. is released from jail, at which time he returns to New York City with his band-mates, Run and Jam Master Jay. They are ready to schedule some gigs and kick-start their musical careers when things take a dark turn. Their friend Runny Ray, played by Raymond White has been murdered; this pulls the group into a seedy world of crime and violence. As they attempt to determine who is responsible for the murder, their own lives become endangered. However, the action is balanced with a series of musical performances by the stars and other late '80's hip-hop stars including Slick Rick and Beastie Boys.
