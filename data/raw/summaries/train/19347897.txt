Friendly neighborhood policeman Kennedy the Cop warns the gang to stay away from an old abandoned house in the neighborhood. Instead, he suggests the kids go dig for buried treasure, which they proceed to do&mdash;in the basement of the old abandoned house. The house is inhabited by a homeless lunatic, who takes giddy delight in scaring the children, particularly Farina. Kennedy eventually turns up at the house to save the kids and apprehend the lunatic, but can hardly take care of himself.
