Even after the end of the Cold War, the United States still has 250,000 soldiers stationed on more than 700 military bases in at least 40 countries across the globe, and the number keeps growing. A current example: the last military budget of the Bush administration was 650 billion dollars; Barack Obama increased military spending shortly after he assumed office by 30 billion dollars to 680 billion dollars. Up to today, whole regions are depopulated and, if necessary, dispossessed, if the United States Department of Defense deems a military presence at certain places useful for geopolitical reasons â€“ in Italy, on Diego_Garcia  or in the Middle East. The traditional definition of the term empire means possession of colonies. The foundation of the American empire, though, is their worldwide network of military bases. While they used to serve as simple supply facilities in war-like conflicts, the impression today is that armed US interventions are primarily meant to usher in a military presence afterwards. A graphic film full of empirical data that becomes particularly interesting when Chalmers Johnson, former CIA advisor, explains how this new type of imperialism contains a self-destructive recoil force that will lead to a medium-term decline and the ruin of the American position of power in the world.
