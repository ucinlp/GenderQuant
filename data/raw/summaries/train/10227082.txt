While on vacation in South America, Bob passes through the village of Los Pochos Eggos. His car collides with that of the mayor of the village. The mayor becomes enraged and he begins tearing Bob's car to pieces. Bob retaliates and takes his car apart as well. According to the village tradition, on one day each year, any crime is forgiven provided that the criminal sing a song afterward. Bob could have been arrested, but instead he happened to appear in town on the appropriate day. Later in the film, Bob woos Senorita  and begins to make the mayor jealous. Each time an offense is committed the mayor declares "This means war."
