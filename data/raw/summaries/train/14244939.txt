Shemp wins $50,000 for accidentally guessing the correct make of a car for a radio contest. The boys check in at the Hotel Costa Plente, and quickly spend their winnings. Their suite is furnished with many expensive items, which they systematically destroy. The hotel manager  discovers the destruction when he delivers a telegram to the stooges' suite; the telegram reveals that taxes withheld from Shemp's winnings reduce the $50,000 windfall to a minuscule $4.85. Just then, three attractive gold diggers , who are also guests at the hotel, connive their way into the boys' room. After twice being accidentally drenched with ice water thrown by the boys, the girls hit the stooges over the head with champaign bottles.
