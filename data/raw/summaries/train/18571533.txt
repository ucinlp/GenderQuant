The film relates a mystery story of multiple murders over a period of 20 years. It begins in the early twentieth century when several pregnant girls meet in a country house for unwed mothers where they have been sent to give birth and have their children adopted. The girls are never seen by outsiders again, and after lengthy investigation, the police file is left unclosed. Nearly twenty years pass and professor Owen Smith  and his assistant Amelia Laird  return to the house to investigate and document the now mythical murder case. They explore the house and quickly discover the secret.
