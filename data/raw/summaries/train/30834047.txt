In the small town of Chipitongo el Alto  the political boss Mario N. Cruz is the only candidate for municipal presidency. The town's dim-eyed pressman, Don Casimiro Buenavista, mistakenly types the name of María N. Cruz in all of the town's voting ballots. When the lawyer Castulo Barrenillo  reads a ballot and upon hearing it, Mario N. Cruz is enraged, but Barrenillo asks if someone knows if she really does exist. The municipal secretaries confirm it, saying that she did not vote and is a potter. Then after, the municipal government heads to María's adobe house to declare to her that she is the new elected municipal president, and to advise her to modify the presidency's moral.
