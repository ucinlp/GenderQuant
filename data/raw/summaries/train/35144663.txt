The film opens on a man dragging a plastic bag into his home, about the size and shape of a bodybag, from which he produces women's clothing and says "I'm sorry" and "I love you so much". He produces a rose which he holds above the bag which transforms into a hot-air balloon which floats over a band singing "Tom Cruise" by Totally Different Animals. The scene shifts through the Far Eastern city and finds itself at a zoo where two tigers pace in a cave to "Spending My Time by Mario Giacalone. The tigers turn out to be merely in the imaginations of two small girls who are being taken to the zoo by their mother, but it is closed.
