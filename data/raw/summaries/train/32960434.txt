After taking off from Vancouver, a Douglas DC-3 airliner catches on fire and crashes in the Canadian north. On board were two young children, Don  and Janet Heldon , ultimately the only survivors. Their father, pilot Vince  and his wife Julie  join forces with the family friend, bush pilot "Brandy"  and Nora Stead , the children's mother  to mount a desperate aerial search before incoming bad weather arrives. Tensions mount as the children face the danger of exposure and a mountain lion that begins to track them while the searchers themselves are in conflict as the hotshot pilot Stead creates problems with her constant efforts to take over the search. A final effort sees a reconciliation and a successful rescue in the nick of time.
