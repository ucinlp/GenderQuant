Small-time pimp Luca Canali  is hunted by both local mobsters and two killers  sent by the New York mafia after a shipment of heroin fails to arrive. But it becomes apparent he is not as soft as he appears as a deadly cat-and-mouse game is played out on the streets of Milan. The film contains a dramatic chase scene where Canali pursues an assassin both on car and on foot. The two American hitmen have contrasting personalities. Dave  is something of a playboy and loudmouth, while Frank  is quiet and professional. The concept of two hitmen teamed up, one black and one white, appears to have been a likely inspiration for the characters played by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction.Italian B-Movies: Tarantino's inspiration
