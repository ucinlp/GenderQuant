The documentary tells the story of several tangodancers in the crisis-ridden Buenos Aires. In the “Catedral”, a 200 years old granary in Buenos Aires, an orchestra plays 12 well known tangos, while the weekly guests of the ball move in circles. At the core of it stands 71 years old professional dancer Roberto Tonet and the 20 year old dancer Marcela. Tonet lost his pension during the banking crisis and Marcela is preparing her emigration towards Europe. Around them dance more people who we will follow from the “Catedral” into the real life during the course of the movie. We see Rodrigo and Fabiana, two school children who live in the poor neighborhood Nueva Pompeya. Rodrigo is the son of Bolivian immigrants, Fabiana lives alone with her three siblings since her mother left to work as a cleaning lady in Spain, in order to gain enough money to pay rent. The movie shows the goodbye of the mother and the four children she had to leave behind. In the hippest Tango club of the city we meet five freaks of the trashrockband „Las Muñecas“ who live in the “Catedral”, organize tango-balls and interpret Gardel ‘s songs on their e-guitars. Tango is the expression of crisis and lost hope and their connection will be shown by the history of these dancers who lost their wealth, jobs and salaries due to the current situation. In 12 Tangos the story of these dancers and their ancestors is told. Tango, crisis, imigration and emigration join to a cohesive story about the past, present and future of these people and Buenos Aires.http://www.12tangos.com/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459733/
