This film showcases the cultural differences of the east and the west. Adinarayana  moves to the United States along with his wife and daughter  to join his younger brother Ramarao. Their neighbors are Chris  a Caucasian American, and Ronald an African American . Both fall in love with Adinarayana's daughter Sandhya, and when both of them propose to her the same day, she accepts Chris's proposal. Knowing that her dad is too traditional, eccentric, and orthodox to approve of their love, Sandhya elopes with Chris and they get married. Adinarayana doesn't have a choice than to silently witness the happenings, but when he has a granddaughter, he takes her back to India and settles there, intending to bring her up in a traditional Indian environment, and away from the foreign lure that snatched away his own daughter. As a grownup, Sandhya's daughter hates her dad Chris, assuming that he was at fault and was thus disapproved by her grandpa. Chris and Sandhya visit India when Adinarayana passes away, and that's when their daughter realizes her dads humility and love towards Sandhya and Adinarayana through a series of events and repents for all the ill feelings she bore all those years, thus accompanying them to the USA.
