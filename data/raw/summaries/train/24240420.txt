A young woman comes home to a half-empty apartment, and she feels alone. An older man walks through the corridors of a half-empty airport, and he feels alone and sad. He takes a photograph out of his wallet, tears it in two and drops it on the moving walkway. Both are torn in two. A girl in Paris is alone with a cat. A man arrives in Warsaw, and a woman is there to meet him. She drives him to his parent's home. An accident, a murderâ€”nothing alters the imperturable course of life.
