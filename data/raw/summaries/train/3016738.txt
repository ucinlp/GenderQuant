Jennifer , a 17-year-old mall rat punk-goth girl, takes a shine to the 49-year-old manager of a Los Angeles clothing store, Randall Harris , who also notices her. In an unlikely move, he gives her a job as a stockroom clerk, but she finds her way to the front of the store and begins to interact with -- and sell clothes to -- customers. As the two strike up an unlikely friendship, they realize that neither has any close friends with whom they can talk. They nickname each other "J" and "R." Randall helps Jennifer get an apartment of her own with an advance on her salary. He buys her a dress for work. While he can't go through with getting a tattoo, he does go with her to a cemetery to lie on graves and feel the "energy" of the deceased -- something she does regularly. At one point, Jennifer reveals to Randall that she engages in self harm. After Randall collapses in the street while taking a walk, Jennifer discovers he has a terminal disease, leukemia, and doesn't have long to live. While collecting his personal belongings at his home, she discovers the address of his ex-wife. Unable to contact her by phone, J drives to Albuquerque, New Mexico only to find she had died six months earlier in a car accident. J meets the woman's  son, Randy, a deeply cynical young man who was told his father had died before he was born. Jennifer convinces him to come back to L.A. before Randall dies. Because of Jennifer, they have a brief time to get to know one another. Her friendship with Randall inspires her to seek a more friendly relationship with her own mother, father and stepfather. In Randall's final days, Jennifer organizes a dinner at which his son and Jennifer's family come together to celebrate his life.
