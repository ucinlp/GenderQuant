Vietnam veteran William Lansing , a former CSA agent who now works on a wildlife refuge in Northern Alaska, has been exchanging letters in a pen-pal relationship with Irena Morawska , a 13-year-old orphaned girl in Warsaw, Poland that he's helping out financially. When the letters suddenly stop coming, Lansing heads to Poland to figure out the reason. He discovers that the orphanage that Irena was staying in, which is financed by honest—and unsuspecting—good-intentioned Samaritans, is a cover for a human trafficking network. Run by a man named Faisal , the operation is worth billions—girls are sold and traded to the highest bidders from all over the world. Through his letters to Irena, Lansing has taught Irena how to use secret codes, which she uses to keep him updated on where Faisal is taking her to. Lansing stays on Faisal's trail, teaming up with local cop Kasia Lato  to rescue Irena and the other girls, and bring down Faisal's human trafficking network.
