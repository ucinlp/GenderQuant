On September 28, 1659, a ship founders. The captain's daughter and cabin boy, Robin Crusoe , and a sailor named Sykes reach a deserted island. When Sykes tries to force Robin to show her appreciation for his efforts, she flees up a hill. In the ensuing struggle, he falls over a cliff and is killed. She soon settles in, building herself a tree house. When a party of savages shows up with two women captives, she watches from hiding as they execute one in gruesome fashion. She then rescues the other , and the two fight off the men with the aid of her flintlock. She names her new companion Friday, as that was the day of her rescue. The two women become friends. In December, Royal Navy officer Jonathan  washes ashore. Robin's experiences with lecherous sailors and her cruel father have embittered her against men, and she is hostile and suspicious at first. When Jonathan learns that she is repairing a longboat that can hold only two, he suggests that the "fittest" take it, and send help back for Friday. Robin, however, insists she and Friday will use the boat. Eventually, Jonathan overcomes her prejudice against him, and they spend the night together. The next morning, she awakens to find he has stolen the longboat and is sailing away. When he returns, she assumes he is a coward, and sets out to kill him. He informs her that he turned back for her. Before she can shoot him, however, the savages return and capture Friday. Robin and Jonathan rescue her, but are surrounded. When all seems lost, Robin admits she wants to marry Jonathan. Just then, a warship appears and bombards the attackers, enabling the trio to steal an outrigger canoe and reach the safety of the ship.
