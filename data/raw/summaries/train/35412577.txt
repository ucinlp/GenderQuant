Forty years after the events of Goin' Down the Road Joey has died in Toronto and Pete — who left the city after becoming estranged from his friend — must return to the city to honour Joey's request that his ashes be taken back to Cape Breton Island. Betty-Jo, Joey and Betty's daughter, joins him in the journey, driving cross-Canada in the same 1959/60 Chevy Impala convertible that Joey and Pete used when they left home in 1970. The return to Cape Breton becomes Joey's final gift to Pete, as he reconnects with Betty, Selina and Annie, and learns about Matt.
