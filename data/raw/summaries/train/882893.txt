Brilliant but irresponsible scientist Tony Nelson  develops an amplifier that allows any object to achieve a 4th dimensional  state. While in this state that object can pass freely through any other object. Unemployed after burning down a college lab, Tony seeks out his brother Scott ([[Robert Lansing , a researcher working on a material called cargonite that is so dense as to be impenetrable, with his experiment. Scott is underpaid and underappreciated at his job but does not have the drive to challenge his employer for greater recognition. When his girlfriend  falls for Tony, an enraged Scott steals Tony's experiment and starts playing with it, eventually sending himself into a 4D state. When demonstrating this to Tony, Scott does not turn on the amplifier power yet successfully passes his hand through a block of steel, meaning Scott can now enter the 4D state via his own will. While in the 4D state, Scott can pass through any solid object. The downside is that while in the 4D state Scott uses up his life at an accelerated rate. To survive he must replenish his lifeforce by taking it from others by passing through them. Scott starts using his newfound power to acquire all the things he felt he was denied: money, recognition, power, and the love of his girlfriend. Tony realizes from the nature of the crimes that the only possible explanation is that Scott is on a rampage with his 4D abilities, and somehow Tony has to find a way to stop a man who is practically unstoppable. The girlfriend shoots Scott after they kiss, where he has a nervous breakdown and passes through a wall with various cylindrical storage covers on it, ending with his hand passing in and out. The superimposed end title reads "The End...?"
