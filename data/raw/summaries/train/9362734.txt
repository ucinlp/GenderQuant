Bao Sing is Bao Zheng’s corrupt descendant, who’s hated by the public for his money-digging ways. He has a change of heart when he sees rape victim Cheung Man get framed by other corrupt lawyers and officials, including legendary lawyer Fong Tong-Ken. Bao goes through hell when he tries to expose them, and soon he finds himself on the run with nephew Ng Man-Tat. They encounter all sorts of wacky characters, including Christy Chung as a circus performer/love interest and Ada Choi Siu-Fun as a classy prostitute/love interest.
