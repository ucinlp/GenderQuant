Its a love story with a twist set in Bengal in pre independent India ; the time when young Indian students were competing equally with British 'goras' in all fields whether it be education or sports. This was the time when barefooted Bengali football team defeated the booted British team to win the national football shield; this was the time when the ambitious and educated Calcutta students were matching their prowess in different fields of education with the British - be it law or medicine. It is in this time of rising nationalistic sentiments  that Krishnendu , a bright, young, athletic and Bengali Hindu youth falls in love with an equally talented and attractive but Christian Rina Brown . Both of them were students at the Calcutta Medical College and they come close during their interaction in multitude of sports and cultural events . However their marriage is not on the cards due to the differences in religion  and they move each other ways only to clash unexpectedly again, later in life. Most of the movie is shown in flashback mode; Krishnendu pondering over the past upon his sudden and unexpected interaction with a drunk and passed out Rina in a military hospital in rural Bengal.
