Redheaded twins Anna  and Sarah  Woodruff, roughly 10 or 11 years old, have Asperger's, an autism spectrum disorder . Sarah, as well, is going blind. Child psychologist and researcher Dr. Reineger  tries to assure their parents  that the kids are smart and "intricately involved in their own imagination." The children enter an institute to be studied, two family tragedies occur, and the girls escape the institution. Throughout much of the film, we see a magical, distorted world through their eyes.
