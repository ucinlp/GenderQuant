Chandu  and Suri ([[Rajendra Prasad  are pilots and thick friends. Indu  and Padma ([[Kasthuri  are very good friends. Chandu gets married to Indu and Suri marries Padma. Indu and Padma become pregnant. Indu meets with a car accident and she becomes infertile. Padma gives birth to twins, Ram and Lakshman. Indu and Chandu adopt Ram. After three years, Lakshman is infected by cancer. He needs to undergo bone marrow transplantation. Indu refuses and flees with Ram to Delhi fearing that Chandu will force her to send Ram for operation. Later on, she realizes her mistake and boards a flight to return to her husband so that Ram can be operated upon. Pakistani militants hijack the flight and they divert the flight's route. Lakshman is on his death-bed. How Chandu rescues the flight's passengers and puts an end to the story forms the climax. There is a bit of plagiarized subplot from "The Gods Must Be Crazy."
