Notable for its interventionist message, it tells the love story of a pilot and lady journalist who meet in the latter days of the Spanish Civil War and follows them through the early days of World War II. Filming began in June 1940 and the script was continuously updated to incorporate actual events, such as the sinking of the S.S. Athenia and the signing of the armistice between France and Germany in the Forest of Compi√®gne. The character of Augusta Nash was, seemingly, based on that of Martha Gellhorn.
