Prof. Emmanuel Hildern , a Victorian era scientist, is locked away in an insane asylum run by his brother Dr. James Hildern . Prof. Hildern tells  the tale of how he returned from New Guinea with an abnormally large humanoid skeleton which contained malevolent powers. When exposed to water, the skeleton grows skin and turns into a vicious monster. He deduces from the monster's blood that evil is a sickness that one can get like a cold. By combining good and bad blood, Prof. Hildern's theory is he can make someone immune to evil. He promptly injects it into his daughter Penelope , hoping she will not become mentally ill like his wife who recently died in a sanitarium.
