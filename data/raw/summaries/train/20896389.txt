Charlotte Dreyfus, a wealthy cosmetic tycoon and her 12-year-old daughter Nicole, who's dying from leukemia, strike up a sentimental friendship with a California politician, Patrick Dalton. Nicole has decided to abandon all further treatments for the disease because of the treatments' side effects. Since the girl has only six weeks or less to live, the trio fly to New York City where the daughter skates the ice rink at Rockefeller Center, assumes the lead role of Marie in The Nutcracker with the New York City Ballet at Lincoln Center, and sightsees most of the city. During her subway ride returning from her triumphant performance in the Tchaikovsky ballet, she suddenly collapses and dies in her mother's arms, having achieved her lifelong dream. In the final scene, Patrick and Charlotte remember Nicole, and it is obvious the couple will have a future together.
