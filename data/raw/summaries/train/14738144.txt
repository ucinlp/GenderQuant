The Stooges are moving men assigned to move furniture out of the haunted Smorgasbord Castle. All goes well at first, outside of a few scares, until a clanking suit of armor inhabited by the ghost of Peeping Tom  scares the hapless Stooges, until he convinces them that he is, in fact, a friendly spirit. After finally gaining their trust, Tom tells the trio the story of his watching Lady Godiva , only to get a pie in the face. In turn, his ghost is cursed and trapped inside the suit of armor, having been trapped for 1000 years. The Stooges, however, still have a job to do and tell Tom that they have to move everything in the castle, including him. He instructs the boys to leave him be, as "bad luck" will be upon them should they try to take him away. Shemp, Larry and Moe all take turns trying to move Tom, but various shenanigans, such as a frog jumping down Shemp's shirt and an owl entering a skull and assuming the role of a death's head spirit, spooks the Stooges. As they run into another room to escape, Lady Godiva, strangely clad in a one-piece swimsuit, rides up on a horse and takes Tom away. The Stooges rush over to the window to watch them depart, only to be pelted with three successive pies amidst a cheering crowd.
