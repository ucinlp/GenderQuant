They are invaded by three American soldiers and then soon after three German soldiers, and after much resistance the mother manages to convince the enemy soldiers to put aside their differences for one night and share a Christmas dinner. The Germans were planning to kill the Americans, but eventually they and the American soldiers shared their rations to make a proper Christmas dinner. This included homemade cookies and other goodies. Throughout the night the Americans and Germans befriend each other despite the fact that they will eventually have to return to the war. The next morning an American MP soldier comes and is surprised by what he sees. As he learns of what has happened he turns his rifle on the American soldiers and begins talking with the Germans. Realizing he is really a German soldier who has infiltrated the American lines, the Americans surrender and the three German soldiers get their weapons. The German then orders the three other soldiers to execute the Americans. Just before he is about to shoot the mother, one of the German soldiers knocks him out, saving her. The soldiers depart with the Americans taking the German infiltrater as a prisoner of war, as well as one of the Germans, as he is only 14 and neither side wants him to die in a future battle, and the Germans return to their side. They say good bye and wish each other good luck for the rest of the war.
