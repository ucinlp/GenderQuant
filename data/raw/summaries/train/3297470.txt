The film begins with Captain Red  stranded aboard a raft at sea with his first mate, Frog , both of whom are presumably close to death from dehydration. After Red, cracking under the starvation, tries to kill and eat Frog, the duo is picked up by a Spanish Galleon and are forced into slavery before instigating a shipwide mutiny with the other prisoners and taking control of the vessel. Frog falls in love with Mar√≠a-Dolores de la Jenya de la Calde , the niece of the governor of a Spanish colony. Red covets the golden throne that the Spanish have taken from an Aztec king. Large amounts of explosions and gunfights occur as they recruit a crew of cutthroats to win over the gold  throughout the remainder of the film. Ironically, the film ends in a Pyrrhic victory for the heroes, with Captain Red and Frog again stranded on a raft, Red sitting on the golden throne urging Frog to eat and "fatten up" .
