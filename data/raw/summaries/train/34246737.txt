Set in 1965, the series centers around the early career of Endeavour Morse  after leaving his Oxford college without taking a degree, spending a short time in the Royal Corps of Signals, and then joining the police. Soon disillusioned with law enforcement, he begins writing a resignation letter but is sent with other detectives from Carshall Newtown Police to the Oxford City Police to assist in investigating the case of a missing fifteen-year-old schoolgirl. Having been a student at Oxford University gives Morse advantages and disadvantages when dealing with the insular Oxford system; and, at one point, he tenders his pre-written resignation letter. However, his superior, Detective Inspector Fred Thursday , recognizes him as a detective he can trust and takes him under his wing.
