Priam Farrel Roland Young is England's most famous living painter. A recluse who hates fame, he has not been seen by anyone, for years, not even his agent, or cousin. He is glad to be mistaken for his valet by everyone, including his cousin, when he returns to England. In this case of mistaken identity, he's happy to live a quiet country life with his manservant's mail order bride Lillian Gish. Until, he gets hauled into court for bigamy and fraud: talk about "His Double Life"!
