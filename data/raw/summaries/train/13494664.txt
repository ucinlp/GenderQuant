The film is about a young dancer trying to make it in London during World War II and then discovers that people like her singing voice. Although she's reluctant at first to sing, she finally does and becomes a star. She meets a young musician who composes classical music and who turns his nose up at modern vulgar popular music, but she believes he can be a success at it and sets out to turn him around.
