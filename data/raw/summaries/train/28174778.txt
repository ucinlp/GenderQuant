Two men engage in a semi-friendly rivalry at the beginning of the film. Hill's character occasionally ruins the other's hunting safaris. It turns out that Spencer's character is none too honest, either, since he gives his tourists rifles loaded with blanks so they can't hurt each other or the animals. The two have to team up to stop a villain, with plenty of comedy, eating, and violence.
