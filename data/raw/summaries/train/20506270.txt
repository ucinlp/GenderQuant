Allison , a survivor of the original Sleepaway Camp, is being plagued by nightmares which gruesomely force her to revisit the camp site. Unable to recall the actual occurrences due to a forced mental block, she seeks the help of a psychiatrist in overcoming her insomnia. After numerous visits and hypnosis, Allison's psychiatrist advises her that she is a survivor of a massacre which occurred at a camp over a decade ago. Her disbelief for the whole situation inclines her doctor to advise her to return to the site for an afternoon, in hopes that if she were to see the scenes of the crimes, she would remember them and overcome them. Doubtful, Allison sets out for the camp she attended but never remembered. When she reaches her destination, she finds the camp to be closed and abandoned, the land now Federal Property. She remininces about the events that occurred in the original trilogy. Allison narrates over many of these scenes. Archive footage from the first three film are organised into themes, such as Angela being afraid of water. Allison looks for the ranger, Jack , that her psychologist, Dr. Lewis, advised her to meet up with. The ranger tries to start kissing her, but Allison decides things are going too far and runs away. The ranger chases her through the woods. Allison stops because she can run no longer. Then she is found by a hunter, Eugene . Later on, she approaches the ranger with a gun and threatens to kill him if he doesn't stay away from her. She then approaches the hunter and shoots him. In the next scene, Allsion is standing in the sun with a knife, which the sun is reflecting light off of. The ranger approaches her, but she whirls around and the film freezes as she holds the knife near him. It then cuts to a cabin, where you see the ranger's dead body. The credits then roll over the image of his dead body.http://www.sleepawaycampfilms.com/sc4survivor.pdf
