The movie has Navya Nair as Yamuna who is preparing for the big day in her life that is for her marriage. In comes a letter from her psychiatrist Ravi Varman , who had treated her for schizophrenic disorder, three years ago. Ravi Varman now wants to meet her, as she is soon to witness some critical of the circumstances. Ravi Varman, according to his unsatisfied wife Jyothi , is more like a mentally challenged person than most of his patients, treating only one patient at a time, that too in an alien hill bungalow. Though the mental issues and associated unsettling hallucinations faced by Yamuna are confusing, Ravi Varman finds the root causes of continuous ‘vulture episodes’ through his travels into the subconscious mind and starts his treatments, finally to get the girl disowned by even her parents.
