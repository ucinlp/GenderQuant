Twenty-three years after scoring the winning touchdown for his college football team (as told in [[The Freshman  mild-mannered Harold Diddlebock , who has been stuck in a dull, dead-end book-keeping job for years, is let go by his pompous boss, advertising tycoon J.E. Waggleberry , with nothing but a tiny pension. He bids farewell to the girl at the desk down the aisle, Miss Otis , whom he had hoped to marry &ndash; just as he had hoped to marry five of her older sisters before that &ndash; and wanders aimlessly through the streets, his life's savings in hand. He falls in with a racetrack tout named Wormy  and finds himself in a bar. When he tells the bartender  that he's never had a drink in his life, the barkeep creates a potent cocktail he calls "The Diddlebock", one sip of which is enough to release Harold from all his inhibitions, setting him off on a day-and-a-half binge of spending and carousing. When his widowed sister Flora  wakes him up, he finds that he has a hangover, but he also has a garish new wardrobe, a ten-gallon hat, a hansom cab complete with driver, and ownership of a bankrupt circus. Trying to sell the circus Harold and Wormy visit circus-loving Wall Street banker Lynn Sargent , and then, when he turns them down, the rest of the town's bankers. To get past the bank guards, Harold brings along Jackie the Lion, who incites panic, and Harold, Wormy and the lion end up on the ledge of a skyscraper, but avoid plunging to certain death. The three are arrested and thrown in jail, but Miss Otis bails them out, and they find that the publicity has attracted a mob of bankers who want to buy the circus &ndash; but Ringling Brothers outbids them. Harold celebrates with another "Diddlebock", and finds out when he wakes up that he got $175,000 for the circus, he's now an executive at Waggleberry's agency, and that he and Miss Otis got married during his first binge.<ref nameavg&sql5867&category=Full%20Synopsis Full synopsis]Li, Kathy Plot summary
