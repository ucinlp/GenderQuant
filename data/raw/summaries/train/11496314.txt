Vitus, played by Teo Gheorghiu, is a highly gifted pianist at the age of 12. His parents mean well, but are over-protective, so Vitus seeks refuge with his grandfather , who loves flying. After faking a head injury, Vitus secretly amasses a fortune on the stock market. The money allows his grandfather to purchase a Pilatus PC-6 and his father to return triumphantly to the company that had fired him previously. Also, Vitus tries to get with his former babysitter, Isabel. The movie ends with Vitus performing Robert Schumann's Piano Concerto on stage with the Zurich Chamber Orchestra.
