Wisdom's character works for Grimsdale's Dairy as a milkman, in competition with Consolidated Dairies, an ever-growing rival company under the management of Walter Hunter . Much of the humour centres on classic slapstick comedy, with Norman encountering various comedic escapades. These include being dragged around Mr. Hunter's garden by an errant lawnmower and using the fire brigade's high pressure hosepipes to blast firemen off their ladders, after being called to a suspected fire at Consolidated Dairies' HQ. The film used some notable special effects: to create extra storeys in the Consolidated Dairies' building and to create the illusion that Mrs. Hoskins  has a horse's head.
