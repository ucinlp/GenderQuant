 The Stooges are vaudeville entertainers who trek to Mexico to perform their gag bull fight shtick, with Curly as the brave matador, and Moe and Larry dressed in a bull costume. Along the way, they cross paths with attractive senorita Dolores Sanchez . They also cross paths with her jealous and hot-tempered husband José ([[Harry Burns . In an act of revenge for Curly flirting with Dolores, José pays the bullring attendants to release a live bull into the ring. Moe and Larry flee the ring, but Curly is unaware of the switch. He eventually head-butts the wild animal, and is paraded out of the ring to the rousing cheers of "Olé, Americano!"
