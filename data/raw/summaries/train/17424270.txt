Everyone wants to meet Arlen Faber , the world famous author of the best-selling spiritual book Me and God, but crotchety, disgruntled Arlen simply wants to be left alone, and so far he's been successful at keeping his identity a secret. But all that changes when troubled bookstore owner Kris Lucas  discovers his home address and barters books for Arlen's words of wisdom, and a back injury leads the reclusive writer to date chiropractor and overprotective single mother Elizabeth . As Arlen's relationships with his newfound friends grow, he must come to terms with his past and the realization that he doesn't hold all the answers.
