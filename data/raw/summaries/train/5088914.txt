Oliver is making plans to be married to his sweetheart Dulcy with Stan as his best man, but the plans are thwarted when Dulcy's father sees a picture of Ollie and forbids the marriage. The couple plan to elope, and steal away at night to a Justice of the Peace. After typical Laurel and Hardy blundering, they manage to sneak the girl away from her father's house. After this, there is a memorable scene in which Ollie, his gargantuan fianc√©e and Stan try to cram into a tiny car Stan hired for their elopement, Ollie having expected a "limousine". After much struggling they finally succeed in getting themselves and a suitcase into the car, but as they move off it tilts up under the weight and Stan's head smashes through the roof. The film concludes with a cross-eyed justice marrying Ollie to Stan.
