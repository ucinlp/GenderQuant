A teenager struggles with a troubled family environment as she tries to make a life for herself in this independent drama. Sweetness O'Hara is the 17-year-old daughter of a troubled and ethnically diverse couple; her father, Gordon, who is white, is caring but suffers from violent mood swings, while her African-American mother, Lorene, struggles with severe emotional issues that lead her to abandon the household. While Sweetness is pretty and bright, she attends a school dominated by youth gangs, and she's often the target of a band of streetwise girls led by Latonya who resent her for her light skin. While her school counselor, Coleman, believes she can make something of herself, Sweetness is more interested in immediate survival than her long-term future, and she allies herself with Roland, who lures her into the world of drug dealing.{{allrovi movie}}
