Five people visit a fairground sideshow run by the sinister Dr. Diabolo . Having shown them a handful of haunted-house-style attractions, he promises them a genuinely scary experience if they will pay extra. Their curiosity gets the better of them, and the small crowd follows him behind a curtain, where they each view their fate through the shears of the female deity Atropos . In "Enoch", a greedy playboy  takes advantage of his dying uncle , and falls under the spell of a man-eating cat. In "Terror Over Hollywood", a Hollywood starlet  discovers her co-stars are androids. In "Mr. Steinway", a possessed grand piano by the name of Euterpe becomes jealous of its owner's new lover  and takes revenge. And in "The Man Who Collected Poe", a Poe collector  murders another collector  over a collectable he refuses to show him, only to find his fate with Edgar Allan Poe himself.
