A madcap comedy featuring a band of roving musicians whose music is just a cover for the fact that they are actually con men. They find ample opportunity to ply their trade amidst all the confusion as people flee the invading Nazis. They tour the country and vie with each other for how much they can pilfer, scam, con, or lift from the unsuspecting citizenry. Their talents are put to the test when a German Captain falls for the singer in the group, and they decide to use him to obtain important ID papers for everyone. When a 10-year-old Jewish girl needs help in hiding from the Germans in order to escape being sent to a concentration camp, the group of thieves not only decide to protect the girl, but join forces with the underground resistance fighters to get rid of several German officers at the same time.
