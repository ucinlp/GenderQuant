In the Paris Zoo, Penelope Pussycat is starving, trying to beg the local zookeeper to give her some of the lions' food, who gently but sternly refuses. She then deliberately paints a white stripe on her back, disguising herself as a skunk, so as to be fed. The ploy works, but unfortunately for Penelope, she is discovered by Pepe, who immediately mistakes her for "le petite femme skunk" and pursues her affections. Suddenly however, Pepe remembers his plan of a rendezvous. He then sets up a makeshift house, serving Penelope champagne. She escapes Pepe, who of course pursues, believing her to be playing in the "lovers' chase", to which he obliges. In the process, he scares off a French poodle, but finds Penelope, who hits him with a mallet. He follows Penelope into a tunnel of love. At the other side he is smooching and hugging a dumbfounded man. He angrily declares that he shall hear from his second, to which the man replies by joining the Foreign Legion. Penelope climbs a wall, running into Pepe once more, who sings "Babyface" in an attempt to woo her. He pursues her across Paris, dancing with her, which she agrees but bashes him over the head with a club. The zookeeper then finally catches Pepe, who regretfully waves goodbye and is soon put back in his cage.
