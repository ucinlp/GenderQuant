The Cameron family seems, on the surface, to be the perfect family, but things are not as they seem. Their two teenage kids, Scott and Sandy, fall in with the wrong crowds at their high school, both eventually getting involved with drug experimentation. In a disturbing turn of events, Sandy, after ingesting angel dust made by her boyfriend in the school's chemistry lab, winds up suddenly jumping through a glass window of the school  and is subsequently paralyzed from the fall. A caring councilor, Eileen Phillips, sees the problem that is going on in the school and, after other tragic incidents involving two other students  and when no one else on the staff is willing to do anything about it, takes the steps to deal with and confront the problem. The aftermath of this tragedy makes Scott and Sandy's parents realize that even their "perfect" kids can be affected by drugs. At a school assembly, Eileen Phillips storms in and confronts the students about the increasing drug use, sending a message to the crowd about the effects of what the drug problem is doing to the kids and the tragedies that resulted because of it.
