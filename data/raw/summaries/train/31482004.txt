The film tells the story of a rich orphan - Apputtan, a generous and liberal man. He helps settle the financial woes of people in the village. He is attracted to a girl whose education he has been sponsoring. But her response to his love after becoming a doctor at his expense, was something Apputtan had least expected. As Apputtan has studied only up to high school, she treats him like an illiterate. The film ends well with the girl developing interest towards Apputtan.{{cite web}}
