A group of primary school students are assigned homework for which they will have to study the life of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the Turkish Republic. An elderly historian will lead the way during the kids’ exploration of Atatürk’s life story, telling them everything about his childhood, his years as a student and his military career, and also taking the kids on a virtual journey among the most important fronts fought during the Turkish War of Independence.
