A successful escort describes in a series of confessions his tangled romantic relationships with his two roommates and an older, enigmatic client. The story remains the same as the novel, about a man  who goes by only the letter "X" to maintain his anonymity and relationships between his two roommates  - one of whom he's in love with - and an enigmatic older client  who challenges him to find his heart before he will consent to sex. The movie's differences from the novel include Andrew's character  and the location of the story in Seattle, Washington instead of Chicago, Illinois.
