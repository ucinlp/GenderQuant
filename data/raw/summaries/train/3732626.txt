Na-young is an office worker who lives with her seemingly emotionally non-existent father; Jin-kook, and loud cynical mother; Yeon-soon. As time passes she is becoming more and more like her mother Yeon-soon. One day her father suddenly disappears and she skips her international airplane flight to find him. By entering her father's hometown she is somehow transported back in time to when her parents' relationship was just beginning. She meets her mother; now a poor woman working hard as a haenyeo to send her younger brother to school to get the education she never received. Her father is a charming man who delivers the mail and befriends / teaches Yeon-soon how to read and write. Na-Young is taken in by the young Yeon-soon and, as they are now roughly the same age, the two become very close. Na-Young is able to experience the trials, heartbreaks, and celebrations of Yeon-soon before she herself is suddenly transported back into the present time.
