The film is about a policeman, Robert Hansen, from Copenhagen who makes a mistake, is sent for therapy, and then is assigned to a small town in South Jutland. The interactions are intense between the small town people and the big city policeman now living there. The classic complicated issues of small town life are rephrased many times in the film.
