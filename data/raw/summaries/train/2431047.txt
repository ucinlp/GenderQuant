It is the story of a married couple who get into an argument while playing Scrabble. Their cat has just chewed through the power cable for their television, so they don't notice that a nuclear war has begun. The husband complains about his wife's habit of shaking her eyes, while she points out he has the bad habit of sawing the furniture from watching the TV show "Sawing for Teens" . They barely notice that there is panic in the streets. In the end, they reconcile after the husband plays their love song on a concertina, a smaller version of the accordion. Afterwards, just as they start to open the door, they are vaporized by a nuclear bomb and instantly arrive in heaven. Still unaware of what has happened, they comment on what a beautiful day it is and return to finish their Scrabble game.<ref nameNorth of everything: English-Canadian cinema since 1980 | authorUniversity of Alberta Press | pages0-88864-390-X | url iLNhHWfarosC&pg%22The+Big+Snit%22&hlSyJcTdvJGI3rgQe3oo2qDQ&sabook_result&ct1&vedonepage&qfalse}}
