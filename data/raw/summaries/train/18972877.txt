In the film a corporate backed rocket takes off from Denmark, supposedly to explore Saturn for natural resources. Upon arrival the crew make contact with aliens but it becomes apparent that the chief of the corporation wishes to conspire with the aliens to sell off all the water on earth. The aliens head to earth and on the way learn what they think is a friendly earth greeting from what is in fact a German pornographic film involving large sausages. The astronauts are left for dead in space but they fall through a black hole and land in heaven. Leaving heaven guided by the holy spirit in the form of a dove, they refuel and make it back to the moon where they encounter some US astronauts. They then use a US space based surveillance system to find the centre of the water theft conspiracy on earth. The crew return to earth and rescue a hostage scientist at the installation. They defeat an alien monster with a keg of beer in a manner similar to that in Jaws and escape the installation just in time as it is destroyed by a nuclear bomb, sent from the moon.
