At a fast food chicken restaurant called "Poultry Palace," a parody of Burger King, Bonnie does not want the buzzing electronic belt buckle that comes with her kid's meal. When she asks for the mini-Buzz Lightyear–themed toy on display, her mother is told the restaurant's supplies of them have run out, and that they are for display only. Inside the display, Mini-Buzz Lightyear complains they will never be played with—as they are just the display toys—to Mini-Zurg . Bonnie goes on to play in the ball pit with her own toys; when no one is looking, Mini-Buzz secretly climbs in. He pulls the real Buzz underneath the balls so that Bonnie ends up picking up Mini-Buzz when she leaves the restaurant. Once Mini-Buzz gets home, he passes himself off as the real Buzz , and proceeds to generally annoy the whole gang  with his obvious ruse and his antics. Meanwhile, the real Buzz is stuck at the restaurant, trying to escape. He crawls through the venting system, but suddenly falls into a storage room where a "fast food–toy support group" is being held, led by Queen Neptuna, a warrior mermaid . The support group thinks Buzz is just another rejected toy and Neptuna obligates him to take part. Forced to engage in a role-playing group exercise, he finally escapes by using a grappling-hook toy, much to the abandoned toys' dismay. Back at Bonnie's house, the gang restrains Mini-Buzz and forces him to give up the real Buzz's whereabouts. They begin devising a rescue plan when the real Buzz returns. Mini-Buzz is returned to the support group—but with Buzz now volunteering as his sponsor. In a post-credits scene, Mini-Zurg is left with the electronic belt buckle as his sole companion, much to his delight.
