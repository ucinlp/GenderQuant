This film is a look at the lives of Jake and Kristy Briggs, from their wedding day until the birth of their first child. Beginning on their wedding day, it follows both their lives, but more so Jake's, with his voice over commentaries and several imaginary scenes, based on actual or feared future events. After their wedding Jake and Kristy head off for New Mexico, where Jake works towards gaining a Masters Degree, but leaves before finishing, describing it as "high school with ashtrays". They return to Chicago where Jake, by "setting new records for lying in the job market", impresses his potential employers so much that they give him work as an advertising copywriter. Kristy also gains work, as a research analyst, and they are able to buy a "three bedroom mortgage" in the suburbs. Jake and Kristy then continue to adjust to their new life until Kristy unilaterally decides to cease taking contraceptives, without telling Jake, until after several months she informs him that he has been unable to impregnate her. They then begin a program to assist their efforts to become pregnant, which eventually succeed. The movie culminates with a traumatic yet eventually successful labour and Jake's realisation that his lack of satisfaction and sense of detachment are not due to external factors but his own selfishness and immaturity. The last scene of the film reveals that Jakes voice over was the new father reading his novel entitled She's Having a Baby to his wife and son. As the credits roll there is a rapid succession of suggestions for the name of the baby.
