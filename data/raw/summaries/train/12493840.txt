At the stereotypical Rivervale High School, Trevor Adams ([[Ben Foster  is an outcast trying to fit back in after a false bomb threat he made a few months ago as a result of frequent bullying. Trevor is chosen to star in a play called Bang Bang You're Dead as the main character, Josh. After parents and the community hear of the play and its suspicious actor, they call for it to be canceled. Trevor makes friends with the Trogs, a clique of outcasts, and a girl named Jenny, who later becomes Trevor's girlfriend. Towards the end of the film, the Trogs attempt a school shooting, using a shotgun and two handguns. Knowing of their plot and fearing for Jenny's safety, Trevor stops them. The film ends with Trevor performing the play, and it is indicated that the play was performed at the school despite parents' and community objections. The teacher that created the play tried many times to tell people what the play was really about. It turns out to be not how the title made it sound. There is no indication as to what happens to the Trogs.
