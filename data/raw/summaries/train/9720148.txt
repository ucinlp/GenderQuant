Expecting only the basic pressures of attending Harvard Law School, a serious, hard-working student named James Hart , a recent graduate of the University of Minnesota, finds himself the fearful adversary of the school's most imperious, sardonic contracts professor, Charles W. Kingsfield Jr. . Their relationship grows even more complex when the young man discovers that the woman he is dating, Susan Fields , is his professor's daughter. Graham Beckel, Edward Herrmann, and James Naughton co-star as other law students. The film is an extremely faithful adaptation of the novel, but it adds two revelations not in the book: Hart's first name and middle initial , and the final grade that Hart got in Contract Law. In both the novel and the film, Hart makes a paper airplane out of his final report card, and sends it sailing into the Atlantic Ocean without looking at it. Kingsfield's words of advice to his class: "You teach yourselves the law, but I train your minds. You come in here with a skull full of mush; you leave thinking like a lawyer."
