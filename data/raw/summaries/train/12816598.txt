Several years after his brothers' deaths, David Sloan , the youngest and last of the great Sloan dynasty, struggles to keep the family kickboxing gym afloat. Although his will to compete has waned since the loss of his brothers, financial problems eventually force Sloan to fight again in a new organization run by a crooked promoter . His surprising comeback ultimately attracts the attention of Tong Po who, having been disgraced by Sloan's older brothers, seeks to lure their younger sibling back into the ring. But when Sloan announces his retirement after the bout, Po's manager Sanga  hires a group of thugs to burn down the gym, injuring Sloan and killing one of his young students. While recovering in the hospital, Sloan is visited by Xian Chow , who trained his brother Kurt in Thailand. Though David initially wants nothing to do with him, he finally relents and allows Xian to nurse him back to health. Meanwhile, one of Sloan's most promising students  has secured a championship bout and invites Sloan to watch the fight. However, his slated opponent is unexpectedly replaced by Tong Po, who brutalizes the young man and kills him in the ring. Now with no other recourse, Sloan is forced to accept Po's challenge. In a bloody bout reminiscent of the "ancient way" of fighting in Thailand, Sloan exacts his revenge and defeats his rival.
