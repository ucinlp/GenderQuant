A woman  has a series of surreal, dream-like hallucinations and encounters within the confines of a lonely apartment building. Some of these bizarre occurrences include various abstract objects appearing in a room, two men engaging in fencing and martial arts, a man entering and leaving a room repeatedly, and a living wig destroying several items on a table. The film ends with the woman passionately kissing a male mannequin's face before it crumbles to pieces.
