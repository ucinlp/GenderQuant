The film is about the harsh period of Reconstruction after the American Civil War in rural southern states. The period was marked with a number of deadly race riots and angry insurgencies in the south. The movie focuses on the rise of the Ku Klux Klan from a six-member group of veterans of the Confederate Army into a terrorist organization. It tells of the battles between Ku Klux Klan First Grand Wizard Nathan Bedford Forrest and Governor of Tennessee William Gannaway Brownlow, the Memphis and New Orleans Massacres, the Lowry War in Robeson County, North Carolina, as well as Arkansas' conflict with the clan. The footage consists of interviews with top historians, historical content, and recreated segments as told by narrator Mike Hodge. Director David Padrusch makes a cameo appearance as a 'Freedmen Bureau Agent' who is executed by the Ku Klux Klan in the film. The DVD release of the program in 2007 contains bonus documentaries: "Images of the Civil War" and "Tales of the Gun: Guns of the Civil War".
