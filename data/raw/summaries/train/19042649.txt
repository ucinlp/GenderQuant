Set in Europe and the Middle East, the plot follows the Mossad's clandestine attempt to flush out a PLO bomber named Khalil. To capture him, they kidnap and later kill his brother, then recruit an anti-Zionist American actress named Charlie to impersonate the dead man's girlfriend, hoping Khalil will contact her. Charlie does everything the Mossad asks of her, but as she goes deeply undercover, she questions just how far she should go before reaching a point where she is unable to escape.
