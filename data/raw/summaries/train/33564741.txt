Count Dracula's Great Love opens outside a creepy old smoke filled sanitarium in the Carpathian mountains as two delivery men arrive with a large, heavy man shaped crate. The owner, Doctor Wendell Marlow , has just purchased said sanitarium but has not yet moved in. Realizing that these rich castle-owning types have money and jewels just lieing around, they decide to wander about and see if there is anythning they can nick. This works out for them about as well as you can imagine when one gets an axe to the head and the other his throat ripped out by a man in a black cape with velvet lining. In fact the shot where the guy gets the Axe to the face and then rolls down the stairs is so awesome that they repeat the scene over and over as the opening credits roll. Meanwhile a stagecoach loaded with four perky young women - Karen , Senta , Marlene , and Elke  and Imre Polvi , a strapping young male who is really nothing more than an extended cameo - loses a carrage wheel in the infmaous Borgo Pass. When the stagecoach driver is killed in a freak accident, the five passengers seek shelter from an oncoming storm in the nearby sanitarium, where they are welcomed by Doctor Marlowe. Their host invites them into his home as long as they need, willingly providing shelter and food. Of course, Marlowe is really Count Dracula. Its not before long that the new guests are bitten one by one, rounding out Dracula's new army of the undead - save for the virginal Karen. Dracula seeks the rebirth of his daughter Radna, and in order to bring about that resurrection, Dracula must complete a blood ritual and convince Karen to voluntarily join him as his immortal bride forever in eternal darkness. . . .
