The film begins with Kennedy's character talking to his daughter inside their cabin. Suddenly a Bigfoot-like animal brakes in and takes away the girl. Some teenage campers arrive and they too eventually meet the Bigfoot, with many of them being killed or captured. It is later discovered that one of the campers came there to find his uncle. His uncle is later found to be the Bigfoot, and that a bigoted Catholic priest used him for his own evil plans. Actually, the priest thinks an alien who arrived from an unknown planet 100 years ago is an angel who is here to be served by him. After unearthing such alien conspiracy and a horde of mindless zombies, the hidden spacecraft is destroyed inside the cave they used to hide it.
