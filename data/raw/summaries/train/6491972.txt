Following the death of his mother, an Irish immigrant, Chad has traveled overseas to the small island community which was his mother's hometown. In addition to facing the initial prejudices of his mother's estranged family, Chad finds himself the unwitting center of an ongoing conflict between his uncle Tony  and local bar owner Joe Brady , who have been at loggerheads since Chad's mother left twenty years before. Further complications ensue when Chad develops a relationship with Brady's daughter Aislin , as her jealous friend Peter O'Boyce  looks on in disgust and arousal. Peter then attempts to stop the ensuing romance, and in doing so, lands himself in some 'mega-trouble'. Romance, the young boy later describes in a thick Rathnew accent, in echo with the film itself, is "an American ting".
