The people of Harford Road are firmly divided into two camps; neuters, the puritanical residents who despise anything even remotely carnal, and the perverts, a group of sex addicts whose unique fetishes have all been brought to the fore by accidental concussions. Repressed Sylvia Stickles  finds herself firmly entrenched in the former camp until one day when, after leaving her promiscuous daughter Caprice  - nicknamed Ursula Udders because of her gargantuan breasts and penchant for indecent exposure - under house arrest 'for her own good', she is smacked on the head by a passing car and meets Ray-Ray Perkins , a local mechanic and self-styled 'sex saint' who opens her mind to a whole new world of sensual pleasure, as he and his followers search for the ultimate sex act. Eventually, through a series of bizarre head knockings, everyone in town becomes a sex addict, as Ray-Ray shoots semen out of his head, onto the camera.
