Alan Quinton , a soldier in Italy during World War II, has been writing letters for his friend Roger Morland , a man who admits he "never had any standards, manners or taste." Alan has never met Victoria Remington, but regards her as a "pin-up girl of the spirit," to whom he can express feelings he's never expressed in person. He realizes that Victoria has fallen in love with the letters and is concerned that she will be disappointed by the real Roger.  When he returns home, Alan learns that Roger has died. When he tries to look up Victoria he is told that she too has died, and he learns that Roger's death was a murder. At a party he meets and falls in love with a mysterious woman named Singleton , who may hold the key to these deaths, but is suffering from amnesia. The subsequent plot follows Singleton's effort to regain her past, and Alan's efforts to find out what the real story of the murder was.
