Ananda Majumdar, a wealthy, retired industrialist, suddenly falls ill during a ceremony in honor of his seventieth birthday. Three of his sons rush immediately to his bedside. The fourth son, Proshanto, already lives with his father. Considered the family failure, he spends his time listening to music and is considered to be mentally ill. The two eldest sons, who are businessmen, live corrupt lives and do not want their father, an uncompromising moralist who believes in work and honesty, to find out. The youngest of the four, weary of office life, would love to become an actor. During a family meal and a picnic, tensions are accentuated. Waiting for resolution of their father's health crisis, the four brothers and their families reminisce and relive ideological differences.
