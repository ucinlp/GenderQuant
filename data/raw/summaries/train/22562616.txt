Mike Dixon  is an agent working linewatch for the United States Border Patrol on the US/Mexico Border in New Mexico. He's well respected by his peers at US Border Patrol, and loved by his wife Angela  and 5-year-old daughter Emily . Mike and his partner Luis DeSanto  discover a van full of dead illegal immigrants, and they go in search of the "coyote" who was leading them across before he left them for dead. At the same time, Mike has to deal with a ‘Minute Men’ style militia led by Ron Spencer . The search for the coyote leads Mike and Luis to a trailer, and results in a shootout where Luis gets shot. During the ensuing chaos, Mike recognizes one of the suspects as Cook , a member of the High Noon Gang  from Los Angeles. Years ago, Mike was a member of the HNG, until he turned his back on the gang. The encounter with Cook, who escapes, leads the HNG and its leader, Kimo , to Mike. It turns out that Mike has interfered with an HNG plot to bring drugs into the United States, and Kimo threatens to kill Angela and Emily unless Mike agrees to use his Border Patrol connections to help the HNG bring in a drug shipment. Mike would rather not help Kimo, but he realizes that, through the threats made against his family, that he has little choice. Mike is forced to find a way to protect his family from the High Noon Gang.
