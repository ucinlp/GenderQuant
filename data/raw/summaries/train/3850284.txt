The "guinea pig" is 14-year-old Jack Read , a tobacconist's son given a scholarship to an exclusive public school. The school used in the film was Sherborne School in Dorset. Only after the changes wrought by World War II could such a scenario be imagined. Of course, Read's uncouth behaviour causes him difficulties in fitting in to the school. The film was controversial as it contains the first screen use of the word "arse".
