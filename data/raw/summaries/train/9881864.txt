Poitier plays a Korean War sergeant commanding a small, isolated and decimated platoon of American Marines. The film explores the racial integration of the American military, centering on the African-American sergeant's struggle to win the trust and respect of the men in his unit.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,939200,00.html When the platoon commander is mortally wounded in an ambush, he passes the role of platoon leader to the next highest ranking man, Sergeant Towler . Towler initially feels the role should be taken by the combat experienced former Sergeant now Private Kincaid  who has eleven years of service as a Marine. However, Ladd lost his former rank through misconduct and doing things his own way. Ladd's prowess as a hero is demonstrated in the opening battle scene where he picks up a M1919 Browning machine gun and fires it from the hip into charging North Korean hordes. Before he dies, the Lieutenant reminds Towler that he is next in line for command, not Kincaid. One of the platoon, Pvt Bracken ([[Paul Richards , openly questions Towler's authority in favour of Kincaid. With their radio destroyed in the ambush, Sgt Towler leads the ten survivors of the platoon to a house strategically located at a pass that the men can hold until the rest of the battalion arrive.
