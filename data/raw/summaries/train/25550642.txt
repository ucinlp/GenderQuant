The Man Who Came Back is based on the Thibodaux massacre, the second bloodiest labor strike in US history. Following the American Civil War, recently freed slaves on a Louisiana plantation are worked relentlessly but paid minimum wages. Sometimes paid only in scrip, worthless money accepted only at the plantation's overpriced store, the workers become financially in debt. This creates an inescapable situation for these free men looking to gain real freedom. In an attempt to better their lives, the workers strike. This leads to massive retaliation by the most powerful men in the town, including the sheriff , the preacher , power-hungry Billy Duke  and his vigilante group of thugs. White overseer Reese Paxton  steps up to demand justice for his workers. Duke's rage turns on Paxton and his family. Despite assistance from a Yankee attorney , Paxton is convicted by Billy's father, the corrupt Judge Duke . After being sent to prison, beaten within inches of his life, and having endured merciless emotional torture, Paxton "comes back" to seek revenge.
