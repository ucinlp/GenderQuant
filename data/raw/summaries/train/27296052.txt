During the Second World War, Laurence Rains  is annoyed when female architect Hilary Clarke  insists he must enlarge the first aid room in his factory to satisfy government regulations, despite having the best safety record in the country. He encounters her once again, now a nurse trainee assisting a doctor treat one of his employees. He finds out that Clarke only became an architect to please her father, who had no sons to follow in his profession. When she saw how her young assistant at her firm, seriously injured in a traffic accident, was tended to by the nurses, she found her true vocation. Pamela Siddell , a violinist and Rains' fiancee, sees his attraction to Clarke. Through the influence of Sir Marshall Freyne , one of her clients and a member of the board of Queen Eleanor's Hospital, Clarke is allowed to embark on a tough nurse training course, though she is somewhat older than the typical nineteen- or twenty-year-old candidate. Her independence gets her into trouble time and time again with the strict, by-the-book matron in charge of the nurses  when she questions some of the numerous regulations . Romantic complications arise when both Rains and Siddell become patients at the hospital after a factory explosion. Rains and Clarke fall in love. Siddell eventually releases her fiance from their engagement. However, nurses are expected to devote themselves body and soul to their profession and do not have the time for personal relationships. Clarke's friend and fellow nurse, Christine Morris , decides in favour of love, and gives up her career and a promotion to "sister" to marry the man she loves. Clarke chooses differently, but Rains vows to wait until she or someone else gets the situation improved.
