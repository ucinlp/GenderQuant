16-year old Guillermo ([[Israel Rodr√≠guez  does not exactly hide his sexual orientation, even though his parents disapprove of it. He also seduces his English language tutor who introduces him to the pleasures of anal sex, and moves on to frequently cruise the toilets of the local mall for gay sex, getting caught once by mall security guards. As a consequence of that incident, his parents learn of his activities, and take him to a mental health therapist, who pronounces Guillermo to be mentally healthy and in no need of conversion therapy but recommends further sessions for his parents to help them accept their son's sexual identity. This short film was shown on British television network Channel 4. It is included in the gay and lesbian short film collection, Boys Briefs 2.
