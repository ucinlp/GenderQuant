A young French woman, Madaleine Lafarge , is appointed as a French teacher at a rather old-fashioned English public school which is not used to women teachers. She causes a stir and complications ensue. A romance develops between her and the headmaster's son  who is also a teacher at the school. The headmaster  is concerned as he comes to believe that she is really his daughter, from an affair he had during a holiday in France in his youth. He attempts to stop the romance by sacking her so that she will go back to France, but the boys go on strike and nearly riot. It transpires at the end that there has been a misunderstanding, which means that she cannot be his daughter. This is basically a rather lightweight British comedy film typical of its time, with a cast of veteran British character actors, although with a slightly prurient touch. However some might question if a potentially incestuous relationship is really a suitable issue for a comedy film.
