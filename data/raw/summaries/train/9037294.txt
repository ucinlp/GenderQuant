Luis, a family man, becomes involved in a moral quandary. Water service has come to his street...one side of his street. Due to a technical error, Luis and everyone on his side simply won't be getting the service. However, the water company foreman is open to bribes. When Luis declines to bribe the man for his family, everyone on his side, his family included, turns against him. Even when he does try and bribe the foreman, things continue to go wrong.
