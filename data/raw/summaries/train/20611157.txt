The Pink Panther is homeless and is enduring a cold wintry night on a park bench. He decides to seek refuge in a nearby apartment building, occupied by a modestly wealthy hunter. While the hunter remains oblivious, his dog keys in to the fact that the Pink Panther is in the house. Several times the dog mistakenly attacks its master, thinking it is the Pink Panther, and gets kicked out. Eventually both dog and master bolt out of the house in mortal combat, and the Pink Panther shrugs and goes back inside.
