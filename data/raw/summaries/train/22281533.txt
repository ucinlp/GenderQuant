The movie takes place in present-day Mexico. The movie is about the misunderstanding between the Roman Catholics & mestizo versus the Nahuas. The main conflict in the film is between the Nahuas and everyone else on an ancient text, part in Nahuatl and part in Spanish, called the Colloquium of the Adoration of the King. The Catholic cura accuses the Nahuas of blasphmey since the text is over the discussion between Archangel Miguel & Santo Luzbel seeing them as equals instead of good & evil. The Nahuas want to perform it in full costume in the town's church, much to the dismay of the everyone else.
