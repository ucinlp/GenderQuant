Jo Weisman, a young Jewish Parisian, and his family are taken by the Nazis and Vichy collaborators in the rafle du Vel' d'Hiv. Anna Traube, a 20 year old woman, walks out of the velodrome with forged papers; her mother and sister are captured. Annette Monod, a Protestant nurse, volunteers for the velodrome, and assists Jewish doctor David Sheinbaum. From the Vélodrome d'Hiver Jo's family and Sheinbaum are transferred to Beaune-la-Rolande. Monod comes along. The parents are dispatched by train to supposed "work camps in the East" , and Sheinbaum too. Monod wants to come along, but Sheinbaum talks her out of that. After some time authorities announce that for humanitarian reasons the children will be united with their parents in the east . Some children believe they will rejoin their parents. However, Jo and another boy, Pavel, escape under barbed wire, taking along money that the family had hidden in the toilets along with their valuables. After the war Monod searches for survivors at the Hôtel Lutetia. She finds Jo, who has survived and is to be adopted by a family, and a younger boy Noé, to whom she had also been close; he had somehow slipped out of the group of children taken away on the train to the extermination camps.
