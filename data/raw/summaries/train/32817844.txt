On Armistice Day, some years after World War I has ended, four people gather in General Gresham's London drawing room. As the clock strikes eleven, they think back to their experiences of the way. Mrs Trott , a charlady, recalls hearing her son has died in action. The general  remembers making an error of judgement that led to the death of his men. Denise , the French governess to the general's grandchildren, relives the return of her war hero lover, Pierre , from the front; Pierre could not forgive Denise for having a child to a German officer who had raped her. The general's butler, James , recollects living as a beggar on the Thames embankment after the war and seeing the suicide of an ex-soldier.
