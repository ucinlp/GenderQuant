Three Veils is about three young Middle-Eastern women living in the U.S, each with her own personal story. Leila  is engaged to be married, however as the wedding night approaches, she becomes less and less sure. Amira  is a devout Muslim, but is dealing with her deep repressions about her intimate feelings toward women. Nikki  is acting out her promiscuity as she battles her own demons after a tragic death in the family. As the film progresses, all three stories unfold and blend into each other as connections are revealed between the three women.
