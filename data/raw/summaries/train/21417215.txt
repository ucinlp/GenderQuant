When Porky goes to feed his hens and chickens, a group of ducks steal the corn he sets out. After sending a document filled with insults from The Ducktators , war erupts between the chickens and the ducks. Newborn chicks form battalions from the moment they hatch, with the chickens digging trenches. The ducks goose-step in the marsh, saluting "General Quacks", as they use swans and geese as battlecarriers and airplanes. Porky manages to turn the tide with a machine gun improvised from a wringer washer and a bag of corn.
