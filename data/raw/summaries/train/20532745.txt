Woody Woodpecker's pursuing his favorite pastime, writing a tome on "Work and How to Avoid It," while all his friends of the forest work industriously to store food for the long winter ahead. He's warned by the other forest animals to store food, but he doesn't heed their warnings. With the first snow, the laugh's on Woody, who finds himself cold and starving during wintertime, a la "The Grasshopper and the Ants." He nearly starves to death sponging food off animals. They pour on the ice, but Woody merrily thaws his way out.
