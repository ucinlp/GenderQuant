A young archaeological apprentice played by David Charvet is drawn into a perilous expedition deep beneath the timeless sands of Egypt. They encounter ancient monsters and escape death traps. Through the expedition they discover a secret older than time and a danger beyond imagination. The "sleepers" have awoken. The gods have arisen. And the countdown to the end of the world has begun. The movie was completed in 2007, but has still not been publicly released as of 2012.
