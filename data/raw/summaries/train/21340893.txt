Karl Thomasson , an ex-Special Forces soldier and retired mercenary, is now working as a police detective. One day, he is approached by his old army buddy Teague who gives him a mission: working undercover at a military school where Ted, Teague's nephew, is one of the cadets. Teague believes that the cadets and the student faculty are part of a white supremacist cult being run at the school. Karl accepts the mission and begins working as a history teacher at the school, seeking to expose and eradicate the cult. While investigating, Karl teams up with Devlin, a former member of Karl's Mercenary team who works at the school as a martial arts teacher. They learn that Colonel Brack is leader of the cult and Ted is one of the cult members.
