When American diplomat William Gridley  arrives in London, he rents part of Carly Hardwicke's  house from her and promptly begins to fall in love. Gridley doesn't know that many people think she killed Miles Hardwick, her British husband, as he has disappeared, but without a body, the police can do nothing. Gridley's boss, the American ambassador , learns about it and doesn't take this "lapse of judgment" lightly. Since Carly is also American, Gridley saves his job by introducing her to the ambassador, who is promptly smitten and promises to help her. When a Scotland Yard detective arrives, wanting to get to the truth one way or another, they say they'll help him without letting Carly know they are investigating her. Events take a surprising turn when Miles Hardwicke  shows up alive and is accidentally shot and killed in a struggle with his wife. Carly escapes prosecution due to the eyewitness testimony of her crippled neighbor's private nurse but a new mystery develops over a candelabra which Carly recently pawned and was the cause of the argument between the former married couple. It turns out the candelabra was stuffed with stolen jewels but the item disappears again when the pawnbroker is murdered and Gridley and Carlyle join forces to solve the crime, culminating in a confrontation with the real murderer at a lovely seaside resort and a chase sequence with tunes from The Pirates of Penzance.
