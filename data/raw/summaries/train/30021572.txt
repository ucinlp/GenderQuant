Three boys are walking home after school on Halloween. On the way home, one boy, Mark, visits a creepy old woman. The old woman asks Mark to help her get her cat, Lucifer, out of a tree. Mark climbs the tree, but falls and is knocked unconscious. When Mark wakes up, he discovers that the old woman is really a witch. The witch gives Mark a magic ring, and tells him to plant the seeds inside and a magic tree will grow. On Thanksgiving, Mark performs the magic spell the witch taught him, and a magic evergreen tree grows overnight in the back yard. Mark's dad tries to cut down the tree, but to no avail. Later, on Christmas Eve, the Magic Tree comes to life, and grants Mark three wishes. The greedy boy first wishes for one hour of absolute power, which he promptly abuses. Mark's second wish is to have Santa Claus all to himself. When Mark sees the unhappiness his selfishness causes, however, he uses his third wish to return Santa Claus to the children of the world. On Christmas Day, Mark wakes up, and realizes that the entire adventure he just had was all a dream.
