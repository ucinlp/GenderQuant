The story focuses on ruthless Barney Glasgow ([[Edward Arnold , who will stop at nothing to achieve his goal as he rises in rank from lowly lumberjack to the head of the logging industry in 19th century Wisconsin. His determination to succeed eventually leads him to end his relationship with saloon singer Lotta Morgan  and marry Emma Louise Hewitt , the daughter of his boss Jed Hewett , in order to secure a partnership in his business. Two decades later, Barney and Emma Louise's son Richard  strongly objects to his father's practice of destroying forests without planting new trees. Barney visits his old friend Swan Bostrom , who married Lotta when Barney rejected her. Swan is now a widower raising a daughter, also named Lotta , who bears a striking resemblance to her mother. Barney finds himself attracted to the girl and, foolishly hoping to recapture the love he abandoned as a young man, offers to finance her education. Complications arise when Richard meets Lotta and takes a strong interest in her, which is reciprocated, much to Barney's displeasure and jealousy.
