El indio centers on an hacienda somewhere in central-Mexico owned by an ambitious landowner who mistreats his indigenous peones. One of the peons, Felipe , has separated himself from the hacienda and the tribe and relies on hunting to survive. He is in love with Mar√≠a , a beautiful white Indian girl who is constantly beleaguered by the hacienda's owner.
