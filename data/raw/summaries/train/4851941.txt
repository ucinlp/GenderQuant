Henry Jekyll's wife Kitty cheats on him with his friend Paul Allen . Ignoring the warnings of his colleague and friend Dr. Ernst Littauer, Jekyll concocts a chemical potion which he hopes will help him learn the depths of the human mind. Testing the potion on himself, he transforms into Mr. Hyde, a young and handsome, but also murderous and lecherous beast. Soon, Hyde becomes bored with conventional debauchery, and when his eyes catch Kitty, he decides he must have her. When Kitty rejects him, Hyde rapes and murders her, and frames his other self for these crimes.
