Tenants of a run-down old mall play mahjong with the owner for their rent, including Gigi , a sexy new tenant who learns the techniques for playing Taiwanese mahjong in order to fit in. While she loses to the owner Fu Ho, he is impressed with her determination and rents the lot out to her anyways. However the owner's son ([[Raymond Wong  hates the tenants and thinks they take advantage of his father. His father, though, likes things just the way they are, especially since Gigi , who looks like his old flame, has opened up shop. His son plans to run them all out and remodel the mall, so he hires a mahjong master  to destroy them in a tournament to avenge his father. Finding four mahjong experts to gamble with the tenants, Gigi, Sam, Beauty, and the other tenants soon lose their money and means of survival. Unwilling to simply give up, the tenants of the mall rally together and hone their mahjong skills in order to keep their place in the mall.
