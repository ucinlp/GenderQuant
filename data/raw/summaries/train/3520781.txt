{{Anchor}} Maya has evolved considerably from the first film. Though she was then an antisocial individual more interested in her science projects, Maya has transformed into the typical teenager. Like her sister Charisse, she inherits their father John's capacity for communicating with fauna , her life is turned upside down on all fronts. She routinely lands in trouble with her parents, while her friends think she's gone crazy. With John away on animal expeditions, Maya's mother Lisa sends her  to a ranch named 'Durango', so she can find herself. The ranch is owned by Jud , and his son Bo . While there, Maya, who desperately tried to keep it under wraps so as not to arouse suspicion, uses her talent to "talk to the animals" in order to save Durango from being taken over by a neighboring ranch. Maya is at first reluctant to reveal her ability, fearing rejection from her friends, but eventually does so. With her help, the Durango ranch enters a rodeo competition with a $50,000 award, and wins it. Also, she shares her first kiss with Bo and finally wins his heart.
