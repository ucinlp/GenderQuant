Alice, a young business woman, struggles to find her life partner, a task she constantly fails to accomplish. As she and Claude are about to break up, she starts reminiscing about her past relationships. One night she invites her ex-lovers for dinner: Simon, an irascible singer who involves her in his artistic endeavors and with whom she constantly fights; Patrick, a young saxophone player who naively conquers her heart with his doe-eyed glance while accompanying one of Simon's songs; Julien, a tame and shy man who falls for Alice while helping her push her stalled car to a roadside during a thunderstorm. A rather strange journey through her past begins, a journey made of laughs, bitter memories and, ultimately, the confirmation of why she and they are no longer together.
