{{tone}} Jane  is a secretary who doesn't know that her life is being filmed and shown in theaters, or that those who are closest to her are in on it. She's being sexually harassed by her corpulent boss , humiliated by her fey boyfriend, given the gaslight treatment by the people around her, et cetera, and she doesn't know why... but she's starting to suspect that something isn't quite right.
