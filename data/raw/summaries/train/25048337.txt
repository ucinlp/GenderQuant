A trio of college kids – all friends of each other – attempt to insure summer jobs for themselves by becoming concert promoters at a lakeside dance pavilion that is in danger of closing. A local lifeguard, Turk , jealous of both Rick  and Mickey , tries to ruin their plan and at the same time tries to steal Rick’s girl, Cindy  – who has secretly arranged for her rich dad to finance the pavilion. Rick flips when he finds out about Cindy’s dad, and Turk tries to sabotage the dance hall with some hired goons – who, after failing, bully Turk into ripping the place off. In the meantime, bookworm Jeri , takes off her glasses, lets down her hair and causes some new problems. In spite of all the drama, the kids actually succeed in securing an impressive roster of brand-name talent to the pavilion.
