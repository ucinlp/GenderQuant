The story centers around Royâ€™s Grill, a fixture in the town since 1934. People drop by and see their friends. While they are at the restaurant everything is well. It is Christmastime and you see love is at its purest and the Gospel presented, along with the true meaning of Christmas. It all happens at a place where the best things in life are not on the menu.
