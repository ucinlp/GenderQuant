These include one with a freakish magician ([[Guillermo DÃ­az  and another with a man who gives her ecstasy and has a fetish for fish. She attempts to make Richard jealous by taking a director, who is reminiscent of Woody Allen, to a runway show, but he ends up vomiting on her breasts in front of everyone. Ultimately Rebecca realizes she should focus her energy on being with someone who truly loves her, and that turns out to be John , her nerdy but caring best male friend who has been supportive of her through the entire ordeal.
