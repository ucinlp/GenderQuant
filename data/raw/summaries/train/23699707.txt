Socialite Lois Frazer wants a divorce from her wealthy husband, but he's not ready to let her go so easy. Suspecting that he intends to murder her, she calls Lieutenant Ed Cullen, with whom she's been having an affair, in an effort to save herself from her husband's wrath. When Ed arrives someone dies, but it's not Lois. With his lover's husband shot dead, Ed finds himself the ironic and dangerous position of being assigned a case that no one knows he actually witnessed. In addition to trying to control the investigation, Ed also has the misfortune of having his own younger brother, a new detective on the force, by his side every step of the way, eager to prove himself.  {{Expand section}}
