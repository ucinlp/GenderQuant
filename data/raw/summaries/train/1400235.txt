The quiet life of Oxford professor James Westgate  is shattered when he is introduced to Penny , the wife of his crass new colleague . Westgate recognises her as his childhood sweetheart, and the two resume their friendship. Westgate is bored with his mundane college life, including his German friend Boris who experiments on animals in the lab, and the attentions of a shy male student who claims to be in love with him, so he is only too happy to be diverted into joining Penny in her search for missing archaeologist Pilkington . As Westgate's obsession with his childhood friend grows, he is drawn into a tangle of misunderstanding, intrigue, and murder. Barry Foster imbues his character with comic ineptitude. The film uses heavily the 4th movement from Schubert's Trout Quintet to great effect.
