The opening credits scroll over an animated image of the character Bambi serenely grazing while the Call to the Dairy Cows from Rossini's political opera William Tell  plays in the background. After the credits, Bambi looks up to see Godzilla's foot coming down, crushing him . After a moment, the closing credits scroll over the image of Godzilla's foot. At the very end, Godzilla's claws twitch once. The bulk of the movie's running time is consumed in the opening and closing credits—all for Newland—except for "Marv Newland produced by Mr. & Mrs. Newland", Miss Caselotti as the studio owner, and the city of Tokyo "for their help in obtaining Godzilla for this film."
