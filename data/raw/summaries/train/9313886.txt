Hornby adapted the book for the screen and fictionalized the story, concentrating on Arsenal's First Division championship-winning season in 1988-89 and its effect on the protagonist's romantic relationship. Firth plays "Paul Ashworth", the character based on Hornby, a teacher at a school in North London, and his burgeoning romance with Sarah Hughes , a new teacher who joins Ashworth's school. The film culminates with the real life events of Arsenal's match against title rivals Liverpool in the final game of the season on 26 May, 1989, a Michael Thomas last-minute goal giving Arsenal the 2â€“0 win they needed to win the title.
