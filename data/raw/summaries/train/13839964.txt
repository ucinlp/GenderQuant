The film tells of a Nottinghamshire coalminer's wife, a young mother, waiting for her abusive husband Walter to come home. She blames his drinking for his absence. It later turns out he has been killed in a pit accident. Laying out his corpse, after it is brought home from the mine, makes her realize they never really knew each other. Upon the discovery that her husband has died, the protagonist, Elizabeth, is able to remain astonishingly calm and collected, especially in front of her children. In contrast, Walter's mother, who lives near the young couple and their children, becomes hysterical, highlighting her overbearing and somewhat irritating nature. The presence of pink chrysanthemums throughout the story represents Elizabeth's constant desire for some hint of beauty within her life. One of the miners who brings in Walter's body knocks over the vase of flowers, symbolizing Elizabeth's loss of control over her life. Now that her husband, the provider for the family, has died, she has nowhere to turn. Despite the possibly financial issues that could ensue, it is indicated that Elizabeth feels the family might be better off because of Walter's abusive and angry nature.
