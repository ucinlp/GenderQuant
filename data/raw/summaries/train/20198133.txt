Rosalia Derios is an unmarried woman in a small Sardinian village whose lover abandons her before the birth of their son, whom she names Anania. Realizing that she will not be able to properly raise the child, she gives full possession of Anania to her one-time lover. However, she entrusts the boy with a sacred amulet before he leaves. Anania grows to adult and retains possession of the amulet, but he is haunted by his mother’s absence and tries to locate her. He pushes aside career prospects and cancels his plans for marriage to pursue his search for Rosalia. Anania proves successful and locates his mother. But Rosalia cannot take shock of being reunited with her adult son and kills herself. “Grazia Deledda: Voice of Sardinia,” Nobel Prize Foundation, September 2, 2002
