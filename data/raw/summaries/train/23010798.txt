Eddie Ryan , a tough, no-nonsense, abrasive and racist Irish cop, has to turn in his badge after scuffling with a Puerto Rican suspect who then falls to his death from a rooftop, but that doesn't stop him from heading out on a one-man crusade to find out who killed his partner of three years, Gigi Caputo , all the while neglecting his new live-in girlfriend, Maureen . Ryan's search leads him to Puerto Rican drug kingpin Sweet Willie , and a shipment of guns for Puerto Rican independenistas.
