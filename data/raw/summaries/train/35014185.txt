The film is set in a village in the outskirts of Bathinda city where villagers work in the fields of the local landlord. It is a village where people are trying hard to make peace with their existence. Daily rituals betray their simmering anger and their helplessness. The landlord has apparently sold his plots to an industry which has demolished the house of one of the villagers who refuses to vacate it. The elderly farmer's son is a rickshaw puller in the nearby town. The rickshaw pullers have gone on a strike that has turned violent. Both father and son are equally clueless about their futures.
