When a top oil executive dies mysteriously aboard his private jet, the company's board suspects foul play and hires Hugh "Bulldog" Drummond to investigate. Attempts on his own life lead him to believe two lovely females are "hit men" for an international crime syndicate. Drummond pursues them from foggy London to the sunny Mediterranean, but finds himself trapped in a deadly game of cat and mouse with a diabolical mastermind. It is revealed that Carl Petersen  is the evil genius behind the assassinations  and that his own assassination was faked. Using two female assassins, Irma  and Penelope , Petersen kills anyone who either attempt to uncover his alter ego or block his attempts at making money. The finale involves Petersen's attempt at killing King Fedra, who refuses to sell his oil fields. Grace, who unknowingly reveals to Peterson that she is disillusioned with Peterson while talking to Drummond, is unwittingly used to carry a plastic explosive onto the King's yacht. While playing against Petersen in a game of chess that uses giant motorized pieces, Drummond attempts to escape from Petersen's castle, where he is a prisoner. In the process, Drummond kills Petersen's bodyguard Chang  and presumably kills Petersen himself by dropping him down an exploding hole in the chessboard . Irma and Penelope, forced to be near Grace on King Fedra's yacht while Drummond tries to find the bomb, escape when one of King Fedra's guard is distracted by Grace's off-screen nudity while Drummond is searching her. After a seemingly successful escape, Irma comments to the other that the bomb was in Grace's hairclip. Penelope is shocked, for she envied Grace's chignon  and replaced it with her own . The two assassins are killed instantly when the hairclip explodes, destroying their motorboat.
