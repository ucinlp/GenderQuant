Aki works part time at an Italian restaurant owned by Kawano. She is tired of her relationship with her unfaithful boyfriend, Masaru, and has a crush on Kawano. Kawano's lover, Kyoko, had created a dessert which made the restaurant popular, however the recipe was lost with Kyoko's death in a surfing accident. Aki tries to impress Kawano by recreating the dessert, but she is not as talented a chef as was Kyoko.<ref namehttp://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~p-g/data/2007/071112/yuwaku.htm|title2010-05-29|languageP.G.
