A South Seas island prince is wrongly convicted of murder and executed by having a knife driven into his heart. The prince is buried in a hollow tree trunk and forgotten about until nuclear radiation reanimates it in the form of the tobonga, a scowling tree stump. The monster escapes from the laboratory and murders several people, including the true murderer . The creature cannot be stopped, burned, or trapped. Only when a crack rifle shot drives the knife  all the way through its heart it finally dies and sinks into the swamp. A pair of American scientists save the day.
