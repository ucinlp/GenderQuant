The story involves an archaeologist uncovering, and ultimately fighting, one of the Nephilim. This creature is the offspring of a "fallen angel", named Ammon, that is trying to destroy the world by reviving its son after having him mummified prior to the biblical flood. Once its son is revived, Ammon would be able to spawn a new generation of Nephilim.
