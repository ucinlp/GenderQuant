A supervirus known as Daemon has taken over the Super Computer, and is trying to infect the entire net. Despite being a virus, she is not malevolent, and only wants to bring order to the net. To this end, she used something called 'The Word' to brainwash people she comes into contact with, and has already infected all of the Guardian Collective, apart from Bob and Matrix. Mouse, Dot, and Phong manage to seal off a few systems on the net, and when Daemon activates her infection which has been lying dormant, all but those systems become infected. During the course of the battle, Mike the TV, then AndrAIa, Matrix, and Mouse become infected, and therefore loyal to Daemon. Since it was Mouse who programmed the firewall to seal off Mainframe, Daemon uses her to break in, as she needs Bob to help infect the other sealed off systems. Arriving in Mainframe, Hexadecimal powers up in the core, and uses the energy to fight Daemon. However, it is in vain: Daemon initiates the final stage of the infection, which causes everyone infected to begin a net-wide binary countdown, which will cause them all to be deleted. Being a cron virus, Daemon's time was up, and is instantly deleted. A cure to the infection, taken from Matrix's icon, is delivered to the entire net by way of Hexidecimal through a dispersed portal. While everyone is cured, it seemingly fragments Hex into deletion, as Dot had previously described. At the end of the movie, Bob and Dot get engaged. However, a few seconds later, a portal opens and Ray Tracer and another Bob step through, leading to confusion.
