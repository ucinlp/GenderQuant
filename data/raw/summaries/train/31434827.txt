Maciste and his friend Bangor, in whose care she was left, allow themselves to be also captured and imprisoned. They find themelves in a series of deep caverns, occupied by a race of mutant white-haired albino people. They are living under an ancient curse, by which they cannot emerge onto the surface, except by moonlight, and sunlight is deadly to them. They worship the goddess of the moon. The 'mole men', led by Halis Mosab, a tyrannical and bloodthisty non-albino queen, are using the captured people as slaves to operate their mining operations . Saliura is assisted in an escape and is taken to sanctuary with the Guardians of the Sacred Waterfall. But she is betrayed and recaptured. Maciste and Bangor are forced to fight each other and then a ferocious ape in order to save the life of the princess, but she's condemned to be sacrificed anyway. Maciste not only survives, but escapes and saves Bangor and Saliura. Trapped in the caverns, the now-freed slaves break out onto the surface, thanks to Maciste's strength. Halis Mosab, who is aware that she was captured as a child and somehow became queen of the 'mole men', is overjoyed when she comes to the surface and finds that she can live in ths sunlight. But she commits suicide anyway, leaping into the waters of the Sacred Waterfall. The fate of her people is not revealed.
