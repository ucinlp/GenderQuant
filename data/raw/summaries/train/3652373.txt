Vincent Rubio is a Velociraptor private investigator along with his partner, Ernie Watson, a Triceratops. When Ernie's ex-girlfriend's brother is found dead, the incident is dismissed as suicide. But she doesn't believe her brother would kill himself and asks Ernie to check it out . They investigate and Vincent notices the scent of another dinosaur on the windowsill. It was not a suicide. At the funeral Vincent talks to a man dressed in a strange suit who belongs to the cult that the deceased had joined a while ago, "The Voice of Progress." He pretends to be interested in their ideals and gets himself and Ernie invited to a gathering. That's when Vincent catches a familiar scent nearby--the scent that was present in the victim's bedroom. Vincent and Ernie go to the cult meeting and hear what the Voice of Progress stands for: they want to give its members their saurian identities back. Dinosaurs are living a lie. They pretend to be something they're not all their lives by wearing their disguises and it's stolen their identity, forced them to see themselves as monsters and the humans as normal. This affects Vincent a great deal. Ernie is untouched. As their investigation continues, Vincent and Ernie come to realize what one man in the cult is planning. He is plotting a revolution, turning cult members into feral dinosaurs and releasing them on the humans. This will force both sides to face each other, and allow dinosaurs to come out of hiding at last. He knows the dinosaurs will win their freedom to live as they are, and not in the lie. Vincent is not sure what side he's on.
