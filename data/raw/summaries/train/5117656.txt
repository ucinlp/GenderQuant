Lester Dwervick  has always been sort of different. The sickly teen is too shy to make friends, and lives in a trailer park. Because of these reasons, his classmates view him as a "white trash outcast". To make matters worse, Lester's mother is an alcoholic tramp who often brings home drunken men from the local bars. Lester has nobody to confide in, and often draws and sculpts birds and other animals to keep him hopeful of the future. One day, he is being savagely tormented by a local bully when Sheriff Patterson's  daughter Judie  sticks up for him. Thinking he has finally found a friend, Lester begins to feel happy for the first time in years and begins to draw pictures for her. One night, Lester goes to find Judie to ask her if she wants to be his girlfriend. Before he even has a chance to ask her, he sees his worst bully drunkenly kiss her. Judie sees Lester, who is running away in grief. Knowing there's nothing left for him anymore, the pressure of it all finally mounts and Lester swirls into a jealous rage and screams at his mother's latest boyfriend. He chases Lester into the cornfields outside his home and viciously strangles him, making it look like a suicide, and leaving his corpse near a scarecrow. One year later, several people in the town are murdered. First the drunken boyfriend by decapitation by scythe, next the teacher by impalement, next the bully who kissed Judie by brutally shoving a corn cob through his head. Lester's spirit has returned in the form of the scarecrow, where he is agile, fast, and superhuman. Lester's out to get revenge on all of those who mistreated him while he was alive. Judie attempts to find a way to reason with Lester, before she becomes his next victim.
