Peru, 1774: A bridge has spanned a gorge for a hundred years and more, but it collapses and five people die. Brother Juniper travels to Lima to pay a visit to Uncle Pio, and tells him the story of what led up to the tragedy. A popular actress, Michaela Villegas, was acquainted with twin brothers, Manuel and Esteban. She is asked to wait by Manuel while he is away at sea. A jealous Esteban hides her letters to his brother, while the Viceroy tries to court Michaela, much to the chagrin of the Marquesa. Manuel returns, but a spiteful Viceroy has him placed under arrest. Michaela warns him that he is turning Manuel into a martyr, so the Viceroy pardons him. But on the fateful day, the Viceroy, Marquesa and Esteban end up three of the doomed five on the bridge.
