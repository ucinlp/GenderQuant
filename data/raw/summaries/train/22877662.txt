The film is a typical animated screwball comedy made in the style of such films as The Women , and The Opposite Sex , except for the fact that the characters are fillies at the Kentucky Derby with Southern accents, gossping about some of the other contestants. The underdog of the story is a lonely shy horse named Maggie who has never won a race in her life and suffers from hay fever. During the race, the other horses competing are distracted by a photo finish. They fall short of the finish line in second place simultaneously while the picture is taken and Maggie crosses in front of them, winning the race.
