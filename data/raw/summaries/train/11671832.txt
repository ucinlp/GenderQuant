"A millionaire detective novelist matches wits with the unemployed actor who ran off with his wife in a deadly serious, seriously twisted game with dangerous consequences.""Synopsis", "Sleuth: A Sony Pictures Classics Release", official film site webpage, accessed October 29, 2007. It is much the same as the original except: * Tindle does not pretend to murder Wyke's mistress - instead he pretends to perform the robbery he set up before; * Tindle uses a fake beard and makeup to look like a police officer: * Wyke now tries to seduce Tindle; and * Wyke appears to get off scot free at the end, as opposed to the original where Wyke is likely to be arrested. *In the original, Wyke was an aristocratic eccentric; his vehement dislike of Tindle's working-class, Italian roots was the source of much of the tension. This is not the case in this version. *Tindle is an impoverished actor, rather than a wealthy hairdressing-salon owner.
