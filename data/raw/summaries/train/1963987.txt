The film begins in 1943 at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, with newly commissioned Lieutenant Michael Grayson  reporting for duty with the 442nd, then in training. He discovers that he has been sent to a unit composed of Nisei, when he had expected to return to the U.S. 36th Infantry Division, a Texas National Guard unit with which he had served as an enlisted man. Having joined the war to fight against the Japanese, he is disturbed to find he is expected to fight alongside people whom he sees as Japanese, rather than Americans. From the outset, Grayson runs his platoon with harsh strictness for regulations. He  learn that "Go for broke" is a pidgin phrase  meaning to gamble everything, to "shoot the works" â€“ to risk "going broke" or bankruptcy. They eventually learn that he has defended them against bigotry, even getting into a fistfight with an old friend of his from the 36th who had insulted them. The climax of the movie comes with the "Buddha-heads'" famous rescue of the "Lost Battalion", after the 36th is surrounded by the German army. Then comes their return home, and the award of the eighth Presidential Unit Citation.Takemoto, Kenneth.' . Nisei memories: my parents talk about the war years, p. 120.
