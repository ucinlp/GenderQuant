Mostly the same as the original biblical story, but with notable differences such as, once again, the expanded role of Delilah , the introduction of the garrison commander  who is friends with Samson , more focus upon Samson's relationship with his first wife, a different handling of the 30 garments bet, and, perhaps the most crucial alteration is to the climax. In the original story, maintained in the 1949 film and the 1996 TV remake, is that Samson only regains his strength after his hair has grown long again, thus allowing him to tear down the Philistine temple. Here, however, Samson is taken to the Philistine temple just after his hair has been cut short, and he prays to God to restore his immense strength despite his short hair, and God complies, allowing Samson enough strength to tear down the stone pillars, thus destroying the temple. Unlike the 1949 and 1996 adaptations, Delilah survives to mourn Samson alongside his followers.
