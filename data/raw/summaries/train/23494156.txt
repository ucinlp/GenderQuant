On a sweltering summer day, a gang of high school delinquents rove through an amusement park. One group member, Jirō Sugita , harasses one of the girls which invokes an extended verbal rebuke. Jirō leaves the group and returns home where he lives with his single mother, Misayo . She is the mistress of Keigo Nanbara , a business man, both of whom Jirō is constantly at odds with. Jirō gets in a fight with Nanbara, tears violently through the house and steals some money. Another girl from the group, Toshimi Tani , has a crush on Jirō. The two start a physical relationship but Jirō is decidedly cooler towards the affair. At Misayo's request, Nanbara lectures Jirō about his disreputable lifestyle and relationship but is met with mockery. The following day, Nanbara and Misayo, as well as Jirō and his friends, go to a Zushi beach resort. Jirō convinces one friend, Etsuko , to seduce Nanbara. Toshimi then leads Misayo to the bedroom where Nanbara and Etsuko are having their tryst. Jirō observes his mother's distress and is wracked with guilt. He and Toshimi steal a convertible and speed away. Nanbara catches up with them at a rest stop and, in a struggle, Jirō brutally assaults Nanbara with a wrench, nearly killing him. The two continue their frantic flight only to collide with a truck, dying soon afterward. A crowd has gathered around the wreck when Misayo arrives. An observer mutters, "Everything went wrong."{{cite web}}
