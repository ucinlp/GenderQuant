Matthew is a young American exchange student who has come to Paris in order to study French. Though he has lived there for several months and will stay in Paris for a year, he has made no friends. As a huge fan of film, he spends most of his time in the Cinémathèque Française. Eventually he forms a close friendship with a Frenchwoman, Isabelle, and her brother, Théo. All three are avid film lovers, especially fond of "the classics". As their friendship grows, Matthew learns of the extreme intimacy shared by the siblings  and gets pulled into their world. Over time he falls in love with both of them, and the three seclude themselves from the world, falling further and further from the reality of the 1968 student rebellions. Eventually, however, their idyll is shattered and they are forced to face reality.
