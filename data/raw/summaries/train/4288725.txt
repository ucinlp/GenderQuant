Lisbon Story is partially a sequel to Wenders' 1982 film, The State of Things. The fictitious movie director in the previous film, Friedrich Munro, reappears, again played by Patrick Bauchau. In Lisbon Story Friedrich has moved to Lisbon, Portugal . The principal character, Philip Winter , a sound engineer, receives a postcard invitation from Friedrich to come to Lisbon to record sounds of the capital city for a forthcoming film of his. On arriving, however, the director is nowhere to be found, though he leaves cryptic messages. This sets in motion a mysterious quest. The sound engineer doesn't meet up with the director until the end of the movie, when it materialises that, disturbed by the commercialization of images, he had set out to capture what he terms the "unseen image" of the city, one devoid of the subjective view, while also pretending that the whole history of cinema had never happened. A semi-non-fictional aspect of the plot is the appearance of the internationally famous Portuguese folk music group Madredeus and Manoel de Oliveira, who at that time was already the oldest living active film director in the world.
