Circus owner Mark Remington is concerned that he is about to go bankrupt. On hearing of an overgrown gorilla  in Africa, he travels there with the aim of capturing it to be used as an attraction in his Circus. On arrival, the hunter who originally reported the gorilla is nowhere to be found, but his daughter, April says that he has been kidnapped. Together they set off in order to find both the Gorga and her father. Meanwhile, Morgan, a rival hunter is also on their trail. Trekking through the jungle, Mark remarks on the strange vegetation, saying that it looks prehistoric. On discovering some giant eggs, the pair are suddenly menaced by a dinosaur. Soon, the Gorga arrives and defeats the dinosaur while Mark and April make their escape. Eventually they arrive at a local settlement where they discover April's father, Tonga Jack who has befriended the natives. The natives, led by a Witch Doctor are offering up sacrifices to the Gorga in return for their safety. Mark and April discover a treasure chest in a nearby set of caves, which Morgan attempts to steal, but he is struck down by the Gorga as is the Witch Doctor. A nearby volcano erupts, devastating the surrounding area. With her father rescued, April escapes with Mark, deciding to leave the Gorga to its habitat. They agree to return to America and get married.
