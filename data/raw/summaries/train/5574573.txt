The film was loosely based on the Ramayana. Venkat  and Sailaja  are youngsters who first meet on a train during a rain shower. Venkat keeps bumping into Sailaja coincidentally every time it rains. This makes them both feel that it is perhaps the rain that keeps bringing them together, and they start to fall in love. Venkat is mesmerized by Sailaja's beauty, charisma, and childlike behavior. Sailaja, also, is impressed by Venkat. Due to unfortunate circumstances the two are drawn apart. At the same time that the two meet, Sailaja catches the eye of antagonist Bhadranna  who also becomes infatuated with Sailaja. Venkat and Sailaja meet in Warangal again and believe that they are meant for each other because it rains every time they meet. Ranga Rao , Shailaja's dad, is a typical black sheep with all kinds of bad habits. In the process, he is ready to marry off his daughter to Bhadranna for money. Ranga Rao plants certain ego problems in the minds of Venkat and Sailaja in order to break them up. This causes Venkat to leave Warangal for Vizag. And Sailaja prepares to become an actress . Later on, Bhadranna kidnaps Sailaja. The rest of the story is about how Venkat rescues Sailaja from the bastion of Bhadranna and how he clears up the misunderstanding with Sailaja in the process.
