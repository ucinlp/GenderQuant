A quirky film about life death, and the bit in the middle, Paradise Grove is a beguiling blend of tragedy, romance, and wry Jewish wit. Set in an eccentric north London Jewish old age home, the film revolves around three generations of the same family. There's cantanerous old Izzie Goldberg , who's dying and is not at all happy about it, his hedonistic daughter Dee , the home's owner, a cross between a Sixties flower child and a traditional Jewish mother -- and there's her teenage age son Keith , the mixed-race outcome of a disastrous marriage. Keith's identity crisis forms the film's emotional core: he's trying to build personal and religious bridges with his grandfather while starting a relationship with the mysterious Kim , who turns up one morning looking for shelter, and who offers the promise of a life outside Paradise Grove. He'd love to get away from his domineering mother but can he abandon Izzie? And why does Kim keep a loaded gun in her handbag?2008 - 2009 Vancouver Jewish Film Festival
