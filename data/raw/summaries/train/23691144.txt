Roy is a "Border Inspector" ever on the alert for smuggling silver between Mexico and the United States. Roy's Mexican friends have told him that one of their own has important information about a silver mine on the American side of the border, but their contact is shot and killed by the mine guards. Before shooting him they plant a piece of ore containing a high level of silver on his body. The American mine owners say they play rough as there are no towns or law enforcement anywhere near them and their mine is just across the border making it a tempting target for robbers who plan to rob the mine then escape to Mexico. Other events are happening in the area, such as the arrival of Western mystery author Lee Madison who Roy and his friends feel ridicules the West and those who live in it. The gang doesn't know that Lee is really a woman, so when Lee becomes aware of their dislike for her writing, she hides under an alias. Lionel Bates arrives from England saying Scotland Yard is on the hunt for an English national named George Wallingford Lancaster. Roy notices the news greatly alarms the dog loving sheriff Cookie Bullfincher.
