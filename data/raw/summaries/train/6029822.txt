Kaspar  is partnered with Detective Sam Trowel . he locates the hideout of a kidnapping and drug ring that Trowel has been unable to find because he is too focused on procedures. Trowel hires safecracker Frederick Fenzer  and his bodyguard, Noname , as phoney suppliers to set up Ruthie  to be kidnapped by the ring. She is supposed to wear a tracking device in her bra, but she's taken before she can put it on. Fortunately, Kaspar already knows where the hideout is. At the compound, named the 'Hidan of Maukbeiangjow', Ruthie is killed and replaced with a confused alien. This is supervised by the sorcerer Aph , who is a slave to an evil alien named Utaya . Aph accidentally led Utaya to Earth. Another human looking alien , teaches the replacement Ruthie how to function in her new body. She also kidnaps Trowel so his body could to be used by Utaya. Freddie's brother "Junior"  shows up to deliver his brother's stash of marijuana and give Aph's apprentice, Prudence , a hard time. Prudence and Kaspar end up bound together by the alien Ruthie. Utaya wants Fenzer's help in stealing a billion dollars. He also wants Kaspar's body ready as a back-up vessel, since the dead are usually vapid and confused or become zombies. Junior attempts to catch and rape Prudence, but she shoots him after a lengthy chase. Freddie complains that Utaya is simply Trowel high on junk, and puffing his joint complains, "I don't work with nobody  who ain't straight!" Trowel/Utaya is killed in battle, as are most of the kidnapping ring. Meanwhile, romance has blossomed between Prudence and Kaspar, so Aph gives the couple a ride in his convertible.
