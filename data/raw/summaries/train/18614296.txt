How to Be a Serial Killer is the story of Mike Wilson, a charismatic, educated, and articulate young man who has found his life's purpose in exterminating people. Mike is determined to spread his message about the joy of serial murder and recruits a lost soul named Bart to be his pupil. Mike leads Bart through the "ethics" of murder as well as teaching him various lessons in disposing of corpses, balancing work and play, methods of killing, and many more. Mike and Bart's curriculum is interrupted when Mike's girlfriend discovers what's beneath her boyfriend's charming exterior and Mike and Bart must kill their way out of being discovered by the cops. The film is based upon the 1990 Belgian mockumentary Man Bites Dog.
