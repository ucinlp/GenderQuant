Angry at her parents, Massie calls her three best friends Dylan, Alicia and Kristen and tells them false embarrassing facts about Shelby Wexler, the host of the party, and they decide not to go. Her mother later makes a deal that if is nice to the Lyons' daughter Claire, she could go to the "end of the year" party. When the Lyons arrive, Massie immediately dislikes Claire. At dinner, Massie rushes the family just so she could leave for the party, but is annoyed when her mother invites Claire to go to the party. Massie pretends to be sick and goes to bed early. Later that night while talking with her mother about Massie's fashion style, Claire convinces her mother to take her shopping for new clothes to fit in with the people in town. The next day, while shopping Claire meets Dylan in the high-priced store offering her advice on how to get a pair of jeans when her mother refuses to because she wasn't a certain size. Dylan was nice and sweet to Claire, but was unaware of the fact that she was living in Massie's house and didn't approve. Claire finds a pair of white jeans she loves, which she finds to be a very fashionable outfit and worthy for Octavian Country Day School. Her mother wouldn't buy the pair of jeans because of the high price tag, but later surprises her with them. The next day, while riding her horse, Massie meets a boy named Chris Abeley, who she instantly develops a crush on. Chris is a high-school student at Briarwood, and he knew Massie from her parents' annual charity auction. After flirting with Chris, they both agreed to meet the next week for riding in her parents' private trail. On the first day of school, Claire goes to school with Massie and her driver. After being asked by Massie to switch for the backseat, the driver picks up Dylan, and they instantly recognize each other, but Dylan stops being nice to Claire because of Massie's disapproval.

Massie sees this and storms into the school, furious at Claire. Claire comes by minutes later and asks Massie for a room location and Massie replies with a snide remark. Claire asks why is she acting like "a bitch", leading up to a fight. The girls then begin to plan a way to "ruin" Claire in result. During art class, Alicia spills red paint all over Claire's jeans and texts the other girls saying how it looks like Claire got her period. After seeing the red paint, the art teacher tells Claire to go to the nurse office; without telling her why. After looking for the office, Claire asks Dylan for directions who is outside, and she gives her false directions leading her to the class Massie is in  a person with lots of friends who secretly hate you; they all chose B, except Claire, who preferred to be a friendless loser. Although in the book this is switched and Massie admires her for her honesty  Alicia then makes a rude comment about how she "got her wish", implying that she is a friendless loser. Later while playing truth or dare Alicia asks Massie if she ever kissed a boy and Massie says to ask her after the auction, an it will be a definite yes, because of Chris Abeley. Massie then asks Claire who she likes, and Claire admits she likes Chris Abeley. Dylan points out that is the boy that Massie was talking about kissing and Claire assumes he's her boyfriend, to which Alicia makes a snappy comment. Kristen suggests they go to sleep. They shut off the lights, but Alicia makes a farting noise with her hands and frames Claire for the incident. Claire shoots a comeback saying it was the sound of Alicia's boobs rubbing together, knowing that she is sensitive about them. Claire soon after leaves, even though Massie says she doesn't have to. Claire shoots back with "Have to? I want to." Massie then lets Claire leave. The next day Layne arrives at the guest house to see Claire; where all the girls including Massie learn Layne is actually Chris Abeley's sister. To make Massie jealous, Claire purposely caresses Chris' hair after being told he already has a girlfriend.
