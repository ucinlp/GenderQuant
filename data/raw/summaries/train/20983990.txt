Perla is a dressmaker who lives and works for her siblings, Percy and Penny. After being hit by lightning thrice, Perla discovers that she has developed superpowers: She can generate heat and electricity with her hands, and lightning flashes come out of her hands. With these superpowers, she becomes famous as the superhero, Volta. Volta's main objective is to prevent Celphora, an ambitious engineer, from spreading evil in the country. Celphora, on the other hand, wants to capture Volta to use her as a power source for her Telstra Technology. Volta is a story about life's drama, life's humor, and life's real meaning amidst extraordinary twists and turns in an ordinary life. In the end, what matters most are family and the love that doesn't fail to give a "spark" of hope to anyone... superhero or not.http://divisoria.stores.yahoo.net/vodvdeal.html
