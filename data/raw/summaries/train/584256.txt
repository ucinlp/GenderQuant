Captain S Melly  is put in charge of an experimental mixed-battery during the darkest days of the Second World War. It's a relief for Captain Bull ([[David Lodge  to greet his relief but Melly isn't prepared for the ball-squeezing Sergeant Major "Tiger" Bloomer  and the randy antics of Bombadier Ready ([[Jack Douglas , Sergeant Tilly Willing  and Sergeant Len Able . Forever feigning illness or hiding in their underground "snoggery", the troops are happily getting to grips with each other rather than the enemy. Most prominent of the females is Private Alice Easy  who tries to charm her new commanding officer but only succeeds in propelling her top button into his system! Private Jennifer Ffoukes-Sharp  pines for "Tiger" while everybody - including little Gunner Shorthouse  - gets a piece of the action. Even after a tip-off to the medical officer, Major Butcher  segregation and rigorous training, the unit is still a shower. However, an inspection by the cowardly Brigadier ([[Peter Jones  and Major Carstairs  is interrupted by an airborne attack and Melly's troop prove they are real British bulldogs.
