Very much the typical spoof the film includes all the typical elements of the James Bond films, an evil genius villain, car chases, helicopters, gadgets and beautiful women. The film involves a hazardous health clinic, the archetype villain's secret, console-crowded headquarters, as Agent 000  attempts to stop the masked villain's organisation  from turning the members of Finnish establishment into nudists, drunks or suicide candidates with a mind-control device. The parody content of the film is similar to that of Casino Royale starring David Niven and Peter Sellers.
