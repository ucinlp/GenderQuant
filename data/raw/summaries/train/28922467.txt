The film centers on a character named Askur, who marries a woman named Embla in a pagan ceremony, enraging King Olaf, a Christian who seeks to root out paganism in Norway. Embla is captured, and as punishment, Askur is sent to Iceland with the task of converting the people there to Christianity in order to free Embla. The choice of names for the young married couple comes from Nordic mythology, which describes a rebirth of the world after Ragnar√∂k, in which Midgard is to be repopulated by two humans named "Ask" and "Embla." This film was directed and co-written by Hrafn Gunnlaugsson.
