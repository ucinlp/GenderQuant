The Stooges are the Wrong brothers , a trio of aviators who are drafted into the army, but end up getting a 30-day deferment of duty on account of their claims that the plane they are inventing, the “Buzzard”, will revolutionize flying. The boys get to work, but a series of mishaps cause them to get sidetracked; Moe twice gets knocked into a tub of rubber cement. The first time it happens, Larry and Curly try to get the rubber off Moe by expanding the rubber with hydrogen. Unfortunately, Moe floats to the top of the airplane hangar and into the sky, and Larry and Curly take aim with a shotgun and blast him to safety, resulting in Moe falling down a nearby well. Later, just as the boys are ready to test the Buzzard, they realize the plane is too wide to move out of the hangar. This problem is solved when the Stooges saw a larger opening in the airplane's hangar. Eventually, they begin a test flight for the plane for a pair of army higher-ups, but things begin to go awry and the flight ends badly, resulting in the boys falling right back into the well and into the army.  During basic training, the Stooges run afoul with their drill sergeant , disrupting marching and weapons handling drills. In the midst of it all, after accidentally throwing their guns at the sergeant, they turn high tail and run off.
