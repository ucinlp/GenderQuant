A wealthy but crude businessman, Harry Brock, on a trip to the nation's capital, is socially embarrassed by his ditzy blonde girlfriend, Billie Dawn. He hires a reporter, Paul Verrall, to "teach her the ropes." Harry comes to regret it when Billie not only becomes more savvy, questioning his unscrupulous deals and refusing to cooperate in ways she normally would, but also falls in love with Paul.
