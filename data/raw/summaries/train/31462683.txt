Tim and Eric are two filmmakers who are given a record-setting $1 Billion budget to make a movie. The funds are provided by Tommy Schlaaang and the Schlaaang Corporation. The two waste all of their money and leave Los Angeles in fear that they will go to prison or be hunted down by the Schlaaang Corp. After seeing an advertisement for it in a bathroom, Tim and Eric decided to renovate the S'Wallow Valley Mall in the hopes that they will make back their billion dollar debt. While trying to refurbish the mall, they must deal with vagrants , bizarre stores , and a man-eating wolf that stalks the food court. They are eventually discovered by the Schlaaang Corporation thanks to Alan Bishopman, an abrasive man who owns a knife shop in the mall. After a dramatic shootout in front of the mall, in which most of the main characters are killed, Tim and Eric manage to kill the members of the Schlaaang Corporation before the movie ends with them being sentenced to death for murder.
