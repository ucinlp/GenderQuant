Playing around the ruins of a devastated bombed-out neighbourhood of London, 12 year old Frankie accidentally leads a boy into his death when he falls from a second storey building. Shocked Frankie feels guilty and to his misfortune Len, a petty thief, witnessed the scene, so he immediately blackmails the poor boy into stealing money from his parents to finance Len's escape, since the man is responsible for killing a pub owner. When Len realises the boy knows too much about his life to connect him with the murder, Len decides to get rid of the young boy in a tense chase through an abandoned Underground station. The boy will struggle to survive and not be in the shoes his friend was.
