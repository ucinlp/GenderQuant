Two farm sisters  are feeling romantic and looking for suitors. Mary consults a gypsy who gives her a fortune that promotes his intentions to seduce her. Mary is shocked when she finds the same gypsy courting her sister next to a waterfall. The menfolk chase the two-timing gypsy out of town, and the girls – flirtatious as ever – decide to make do with two local boys. The whole film is shot in just a few setups on one rural location. The title cards do not record dialogues but summarize scenes for the viewer – e.g., "Martha discovers the gypsy’s perfidy", "A cowardly attack", "The old man unhurt but the gypsy man is warned to leave the neighborhood". The copy sold in the Milestone Collection is in good condition with good brightness, contrast and sharpness.
