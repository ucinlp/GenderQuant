During the First World War, Camille , a young woman whose husband is away fighting at the front, receives a short letter of break-up from him. Distraught, she decides to go to join him, but is driven back by the rule of the time which forbids women to move around alone. She has no other recourse than to dress herself up as a man so as to be able to take to the road on foot. Tim Palmer argues that the film is an example of recent French pop-art cinema, in which mainstream or conventional materials  are intermingled and hybridized with intellectual or esoteric designs .Palmer, Tim .
