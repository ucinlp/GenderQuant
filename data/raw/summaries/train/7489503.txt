Betty holds a "Betty Boop Exposition", where she displays the latest modern inventions. Her creations included an ultra-streamlined car, a roadster with multiple rumble seats , a multi-level baby carriage for quintuplets, and a grand piano that can change into other useful contraptions. Her final invention is her dress, which can change into a flower, a butterfly, and a high-collared gown with a train. The dress is a sensation, and soon everyone is wearing the latest Boop creation.
