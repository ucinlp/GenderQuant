This movie takes place eight years after the Growing Pains series finale, with the Seavers in their new house. Mike finally married and adopted children, all from countries around the world, while also holding down a successful job in advertising. Carol is a successful lawyer on Wall Street. Ben cleans out swimming pools. And Chrissy is a 17-year-old high school teen with a smoking habit that she stops at the end of the film. Maggie gets fired from her job as a press rep for a senator, and runs against him for the job at her grandchild's suggestion. Carol acts as her campaign manager where she first clashes with, then falls for, the single dad running the opponent's campaign, which leads to confusion and chaos.
