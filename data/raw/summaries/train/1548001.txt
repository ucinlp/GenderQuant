The film is an eight-minute long black and white short that depicts a Spanish woman encountering a strange singing man in a coffee shop one morning. The strange man turns out to be a suicide bomber, who professes his love through the words of the song to a woman who turns up every day at 7:35 in the morning . The others in the cafe have prerecorded lines to say at points during the song  and even a short dance routine. At the start of the film, the woman realises that something is not right when sitting down: everyone is quiet and refusing to acknowledge her presence. When the man reveals himself to be a suicide bomber , she calls the police . Roughly three minutes later, the police arrive outside the coffee shop. The man finishes his song and emerges from the cafe to the police, holding a big sack of confetti. The man blows himself up, and the confetti showers over the woman. The credits roll.
