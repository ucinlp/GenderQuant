The Pink Panther drops a coin into a sewer while walking down the street. He then purchases a strong magnet, attempting to retrieve the coin back. Unfortunately, the magnet rips off anything metallic he passes by, including the watch from a man at a bus stop and the whistle, badge and uniform buttons from a policeman, and the panther gets in trouble with the law. When the panther finally gets back to the sewer, another man pulls up the coin with his own magnet.[*DePatie-Freleng website
