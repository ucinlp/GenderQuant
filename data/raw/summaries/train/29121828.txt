This police training film uses dramatizations of real life events to demonstrate the battle law enforcement faces with narcotics, most specifically barbiturates - also known as "goof balls" - and marijuana - also known as "tea". It shows how to identify certain narcotics, identify the signs that someone is using, identify the signs of where drug deals take place, identify the signs of use in a secluded public place, and apprehend the users in these public settings. As it follows one young woman neglected by her parents, the film also shows the underlying causes of narcotics use, with these underlying causes often the forgotten issue as everyone tends to deal with the symptoms.
