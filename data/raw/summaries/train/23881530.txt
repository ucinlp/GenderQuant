Larry Haines is the track champion, but his success has gone straight to his head. He's popular, and has a pretty girlfriend Gwen. His two friends Spec Early and Bobby Barnes decide that he need to get his head deflated, so they rig the Joe Senior contest so Larry comes second. They make Don Cooper, the discus and shotput thrower, Joe Senior. Don begins to go around with Gwen, much to the dismay of his steady girlfriend Mary. But it soon becomes clear that Mary's not the only thing Don's forgotten about- he's forgotten about his sport too. On the day of the intercollege competition, it's up to the girls to sort out the mess they've made of the boys and spur them on to victory.
