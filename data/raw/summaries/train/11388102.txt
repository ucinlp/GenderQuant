Tim Kelly  and Max Ginsberg  have struck it rich by investing in copper stock. But when the stock takes a dive, they are compelled to go back into their former profession â€” junk dealers. They take in the destitute Mary Riley  as a boarder and she hits it off so well with them that she winds up becoming a partner in their rag & junk company. Mary falls in love with a man named Nathan Burke , the son of wealthy parents. Nathan's mother , however, disapproves of Mary. Eventually it is revealed that Mrs. Burke came from a poor background herself, and her long-ago sweetheart was Max. After this discovery, she gives the couple her blessings. The copper stock soars in value once again, so Kelly and Ginsberg are back in the money.Old Clothes at silentera.com
