Twelve year old Goku seeks out Master Roshi to ask to be accepted as a student, while the little monk, Krillin, arrives for the same reason . Roshi sends them on a quest far to the west, where "five mountains stand, called the 'Devil's Hand'." Inside a castle, there lies the legendary, and beautiful, "Sleeping Princess." Whoever brings back the Sleeping Princess will become Master Roshi's student. The two boys set out, and Krillin uses all the standard tricks to trip Goku up. A little later, Bulma, Oolong, Yamcha, and Puar —who are on summer vacation—arrive at Kame House to find Goku. Roshi says that the two boys have gone far to the west for training, so the friends fly in Bulma's Capsule jet to the Devil's Hand. When they near the castle, the jet is attacked by demons, and Bulma is taken to the Castle. The owner of the castle, Lucifer, pretends to treat her as a guest, until it becomes time to awaken the Sleeping Princess. In the meantime, Goku and Krillin fight monsters, and they drop in on Bulma just before the Butler can drain Bulma of her blood through a giant syringe . Then, Launch  arrives to steal the Sleeping Princess—which is really a giant jewel. Everyone is captured and encased in a wall of rock. It is the night of a full moon, and the moonlight is used to power the jewel. The moonlight also turns Goku into a Giant Ape, and everyone escapes . They fight Lucifer, and Goku uses the Kamehameha blast to destroy Lucifer's Princess-powered laser cannon , and kills Lucifer. The heroes escape, and Krillin acts contrite, but doesn't actually apologize to Goku for his behavior. The two boys return to Kame House with Launch, and Roshi takes them both on as students.
