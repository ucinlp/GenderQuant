The award-winning film, loosely based on Barrie's work, presents the characters with a twist. It features Peter Pan as an older, androgynous teen, whereas the fairy Tinker Bell is a drugged and burnt out girl, the Lost Boys are hot guys and pot heads, the Darling children are adopted, Wendy Darling is black, Captain Hook is a gay leather man and Tiger Lily is a transvestite. The events take place in Neverland which is an amusement park in the film, rather than the imaginary island.
