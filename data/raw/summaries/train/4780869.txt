[[Image:gilli309.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Velu (Vijay  rescuing Dhanalakshmi  from Muthupandi . Velu aka Ghilli ([[Vijay , is a wannabe kabbadi champion who is the son of Assistant Commissioner of Police Sivasubramanian . Sivasubramanian is not fond of his son, constantly chiding him for his lack of interest in studies and his love for kabaddi. His mother , on the other hand, dotes on him and his younger sister Bhuvana  is the typical sharp and inquisitive schoolgirl, constantly getting Velu into trouble with his father, but nevertheless still adores him. In Madurai, there is a ruthless factionalist leader Muthupandi , who is obsessed with a beautiful girl Dhanalakshmi  and would do anything to marry her. Muthupandi kills Dhanalakshmi's elder brother as he rejects his offer to marry Dhanalakshmi. Then Dhanalakshmi’s younger brother also gets killed by Muthupandi when he tries to avenge his brother's murder. Dhanalakshmi’s father is a meek person who gets horrified by Muthupandi’s acts and asks Dhanalakshmi to go away from the place and lead a peaceful life at her uncle’s place in the USA by giving her the necessary certificates and money. Muthupandi catches her when she starts fleeing because by coincidence Dhanalakshmi gets into one of the lorries owned by him. At this juncture, Velu- who is in Madurai to play in a kabaddi tournament- rescues Dhanalakshmi from the hands of Muthupandi and takes her to Chennai. Velu takes Dhanalakshmi to his house and hides her in his room, unknown to his family. Velu, with the help of his friends, arranges passport, visa and flight tickets for Dhanalakshmi so that she can go to the USA. Meanwhile, Muthupandi and his father, who happens to be the Home Minister, ask Sivasubramanian to search for Dhanalakshmi and the apparent kidnapper. When Sivasubramanian finds out that it's his own son who did the crime, Velu and Dhanalakshmi run away and hide in the lighthouse. Dhanalakshmi has by now fallen in love with Velu, and has been accepted by Velu's mother and sister. So she is reluctant to go to the USA. Velu however, is adamant on sending her to the USA and he, along with his friends, get Dhanalakshmi to the airport in time for her flight before their kabaddi match against Punjab in the final of the National League. Sivasubramanian, enraged that his son is a wanted criminal and yet is playing in a kabaddi match, goes to the stadium to arrest Velu. By now, Velu too has fallen in love with Dhanalakshmi and begins to miss her, only to spot her in the stadium during the match. Velu's lack of focus in the game is replaced by his best on seeing Dhanalakshmi, winning Tamil Nadu the championship. After winning the championship, Velu is arrested by his father, but is then stopped by Muthupandi, who wants to fight Velu, having been incited by Dhanalakshmi to do so to prove his worth. During the fight, Muthupandi accidentally falls on a floodlight, killing him. The movie ends with Velu and Dhanalakshmi finally united.
