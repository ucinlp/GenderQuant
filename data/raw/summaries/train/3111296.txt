The film is set in post-WWII Moscow. A young reconnaissance officer Vladimir Sharapov  returns from the war and is assigned for peacetime duty at the famous MUR . There he becomes part of an elite team led by the brilliant, tough, no-nonsense homicide detective Gleb Zheglov . The duo becomes embroiled in two seemingly separate investigations: that of the murder of a young aspiring actress Larisa Gruzdeva, and the hunt for a vicious gang of armed robbers that calls itself "Black Cat" and constantly manages to evade capture. While suspicion in Gruzdeva's murder initially falls on her estranged husband Dr Gruzdev , it gradually becomes apparent that the two cases are connected, as a Black Cat mobster known as Fox is implicated in the murder. As a result of Zheglov's successful high-stakes operation to capture Fox, Sharapov inadvertently finds himself undercover at the Black Cat hideout, sparring with the gang's menacing leader The Hunchback . What ensues is arguably one of Soviet television's most memorable and suspenseful finales. Much of the series revolves around the relationship between Zheglov and Sharapov. While the two become close friends and roommates, they also clash throughout the film. The source of the conflict is Sharapov's disagreement with Zheglov's "ends justify the means" approach to law enforcement. Zheglov thinks that "a thief's place is in prison, and the public couldn't care less how I put him there". To that end, Zheglov thinks nothing of using dubious tactics such as planting evidence to justify the arrest of a known pickpocket. Sharapov, on the other hand, considers that law is a higher value for its own sake and cannot be used merely as a tool. A tense conflict also arises when, in order to mislead Fox, Zheglov elects to continue to hold Dr Gruzdev under arrest even after it becomes clear that the man is innocent.
