;Episode 1 "Broccoli": Se-kyung, a singer-songwriter who is suffering from a rare disease, can only survive on instant cup ramen noodles.

Vocalist Seong-won and drummer Hae-won decide to sell their beloved guitar out of hungry desperation. Thanks to Hae-won’s forgetfulness and mysterious thinking process, he leaves it at a bakery store, whose owner happens to be an amateur musician. He thus proceeds to preach to the two about what it really means to love music, and they seem to be inspired to pursue their dreams no matter how difficult it is. ;Episode 3 "Unlock": Set in the distant future, a world where music has ceased to exist and sound is used as a weapon, Ji-hoo falls for Jin-hee, an uncanny girl with a prosthetic arm.
