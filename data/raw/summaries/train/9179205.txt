During World War II, Chief Aviation Pilot Ned Trumpet  is in charge of a dirigible at Lakehurst, New Jersey naval base. "Old Gas Bag" brags about his "son" and realizes that he will need someone to impersonate his fictional son. Trumpet finds Jess Weaver , a young disabled man, arranging for an operation to fix his legs. Afterward, Weaver goes along with the deception and soon earns his flying license. While on a submarine patrol mission, his "father" orders an unauthorized and premature attack on a German submarine but the youngster's bomb misses and the submarine fires back, hitting the airship. Trumpet takes over the controls and sinks the submarine, but Weaver faces a court-martial for disobeying orders but the older man takes the blame for his actions. Weaver transfers to the Ferry Command, and while on assignment in Burma, his aircraft crashes in Japanese territory. Trumpet rushes to the scene with a rescue team. Both are successfully brought out and are decorated for their heroism. Afterward, Weaver indicates that he will be returning to the lighter-than-air service in Lakehurst, to reunite with his "father".
