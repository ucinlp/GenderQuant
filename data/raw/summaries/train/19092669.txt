Yasemin and Jan are in the same judo club. Yasemin is a modern young Turkish woman. Jan is an old-fashioned womaniser. When his friends bet he cannot have Yasemin he sees this as a welcome challenge. He plays his best tricks on Yasemin who eventually takes to him because she is led to believe he was no macho but a really modern nice guy. That way she does play his heartstrings. He feels ashamed to have approached her just to impress his friends. Unfortunately this truth is eventually disclosed to her, and when it is, he is dismayed by the harm he has done. However, since this is a classic romantic movie, a happy end is inevitable after all.
