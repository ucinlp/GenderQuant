The film follows a group of young adults who come together to play a Dungeons & Dragons-inspired role playing game, while working at a costume rental store. One of the players is a young man named Adam  who is the descendent of a long line of men who are all cursed by the devil. While working at the community college theater performance a strange magician appears and puts a curse on Adam, forcing him to remember the fate of his ancestors and to make him believe that he really is a warlock. Increasingly Adam is unable to determine the difference between fantasy and reality and believes that, as a warlock, he is on a quest to kill various people. As the bodies pile up, the local police are baffled and no one suspects that Adam is a deranged serial killer being commanded to kill by the devil. After playing the role playing game, Adam attends a costume party hosted by a man named Dr. Evil, who wants Adam to join his cult and also kill most of the female and male party guests. When the cops do figure out that Adam is the killer, they take him out in a factory, although his body disappears. At the end of the film, the surviving Dungeons & Dragons players are playing a game when they learn that their dungeon master was Dr. Evil and the devil.
