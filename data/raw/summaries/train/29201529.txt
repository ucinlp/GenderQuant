It is the early 1990s, and a handful of journalists are trying to attract the world’s attention to the ongoing human rights abuses in Diyarbakır. Eighteen year- old Firat opens up and cleans the newspaper office everyday, and helps with distribution. While researching the disappearance of five villagers, journalist Kadir discovers the traces of a paramilitary gang. In addition to struggling with usual technical difficulties of a small operation, the newspaper is subjected to various attempts to intimidate them and prevent their courageous reports from coming to light. Following increased threats and attacks, Firat volunteers to guard the office at night, and by day he tries to learn the trade. When the newspaper’s distribution to Diyarbakır is blocked, the team has to come up with new ways to reach their readership.
