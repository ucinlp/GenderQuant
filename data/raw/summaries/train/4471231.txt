The plot concerns three characters who have lost hope in continuing their lives in Koreaâ€”Kokosu , an old man who has lost his farmland; Dong-min ; and Jong-hui , who had been betrayed by her boyfriend. Kokosu had been a bugler in the Korean military during the last days of the Joseon Dynasty. Seeking a better life in Manchuria, the three are attacked by bandits and the Japanese while attempting to cross the ice-covered Duman River which borders Korea and Manchuria. With his last breath, Kokosu blows the army bugle he had carried with him all his life. Dong-min takes the bugle and continues playing it.
