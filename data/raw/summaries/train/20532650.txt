As an exhausted Woody trudges through the streets trying to find a room for the night, he comes across a vacancy in Wally Walrus' house. Woody instantly falls asleep in Wally's bed and begins to snore in a variety of bizarre ways that drive him crazy all night long. When morning comes, Woody awakes refreshed and goes cheerfully on his way, while Wally is left to suffer the effects of sleep deprivation.
