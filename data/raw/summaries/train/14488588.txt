 Joe's accidental snapshot of a paper plate blown by a breeze, is mistaken for a picture of a UFO. Moe and Larry, however, take the credit for the photo, and are paid a huge sum. Angered, Joe leaves the boys for a camping trip, only to meet two genuine and beautiful aliens from Planet Zircon who allow Joe to photograph them. Moe and Larry end up arrested when their UFO picture is revealed to be a fraud. They are put in strait jackets and incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital whilst Joe becomes a national hero.
