In 2004, a Home Office survey revealed that there are 20 to 60 youngsters, aged 16 to 24, living rough in each inner city in the UK. They are responsible for vast levels of crime and in almost all cases they have come from broken homes and a history of abuse, both physical and sexual, most of the time inflicted on them by their own parents. Nikki, 18, fled a sexually abusive homelife and a succession of foster families to live on the street. There she met Vincent, 24, the product of heroin addicted parents. Together they spend their days trying to survive the perils of living rough and supporting their own drug addictions. They are wild,unwanted and in love. They are The Feral Generation.
