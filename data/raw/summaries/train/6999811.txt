Finding North tells the story of Rhonda , a bank teller who's depressed upon turning 30, and Travis , a gay man who's recently lost his lover to AIDS and grown suicidal. Travis receives an audio tape recorded by his lover, Bobby, before his death which sends him on a scavenger hunt of sorts to Bobby's home town in Texas. Through a series of mishaps, Rhonda ends up accompanying him on his journey. Together they follow Bobby's instructions as best they can, collecting items that represent Bobby's past, despite the many changes to the town in the years since Bobby left. Ultimately they end up at the gravesite Bobby's parents had prepared for him decades earlier. They bury the collected items at Bobby's instruction and together start to try "finding North" .
