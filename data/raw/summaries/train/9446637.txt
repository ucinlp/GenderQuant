Former Congressman and now Judge Cass Timberlane is a middle-aged, incorruptible, highly-respected man who enjoys good books and playing the flute. He falls for Jinny, a much younger girl from a lower class in his small Minnesota town. At first, the marriage is happy, but Jinny becomes bored with the small town and with the judge's friends. She leaves him for an affair with a lawyer, Timberlane's boyhood friend. Eventually abandoned by her lover, Jinny returns to her husband and becomes the good wife. This is Lewis' examination of marriage, love, romance, heartache and trust.
