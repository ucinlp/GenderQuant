Set in the city of Bucharest, Romania, the action is confined to a week in the life of the various characters. Alberta Watson plays the bored wife of a diplomat. Director and screenwriter Thom Fitzgerald plays a Canadian pornographer. The title is based on the fact that when the communist government forced people to move into working-class apartment complexes they had to give up their pets. The initial population of perhaps 2,000 dogs has grown over the years to the point where some estimate that 20 years later as many as 200,000 wild dogs wander the streets of the city.
