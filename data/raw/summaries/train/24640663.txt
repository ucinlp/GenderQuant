Deep in the Amazon Rainforest, a well-preserved woman dating from the ice age is found encased in amber. Her body is then loaded onto an airplane to be taken to a military facility where she can be studied by scientists. En route to the military base, the plane is hijacked by a renegade group whose intent is to sell the specimen to the government for a ransom. The plane crashes into a mountain ski resort causing an avalanche and trapping all of the vacationing teenagers inside of the hotel. The woman, whose body only functions when kept cold, awakens and begins randomly killing the survivors by freezing them from the inside. One of the teens has an uncle searching for them on the outside, but he too is battling his own demons which stem from his alcoholism. This leads to a delay in the arrival of assistance in the ski resort town. The final showdown occurs with Johnny pulling the sexually invigorated Ice Queen into a hot tub which dissolves her body.
