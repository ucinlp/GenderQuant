A group of schoolchildren from London are preparing for evacuation. After a medical examination, they meet at a railway station, uncertain of their destination. The train arrives and their journey to the countryside begins. Many of them have never seen the countryside before, and enjoy looking out of the carriage windows during the trip. Eventually, the children arrive at their destination, the Devon town of Torquay. After registration at a local school building, the children are handed over to the families who will be looking after them for the near future. The following day, the children write to their parents to inform them of their new addresses and begin settling in to their new school classes. They also start to adjust to other aspects of life in Torquay, including working in the fields and playing on the beach. The film ends with a plea from mothers of other northern European countries, including Belgium and France. They urge British families to evacuate their children, wishing that they had had the same opportunity.
