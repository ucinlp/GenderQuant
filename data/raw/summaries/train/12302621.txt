The film of exploitation in rural Bihar, in which a landlord ’s men wreck a village and kill the benevolent schoolmaster  who was in progressive force. The labourer Naurangia  breaks with a tradition to passive resistance and retaliates by killing the landlord’s brother. Naurangia and his wife Rama  become fugitives from justice. After many efforts to find sustenance elsewhere, the two decide to return home. To earn the fare, they agree to drive the herd of pigs through the river, causing the pregnant Rama to believe she has lost her baby.But they have to swim across a wide, swiftly flowing river, in which they nearly drown before reaching safety. At the end of the film Naurangia puts his ear to her belly and listens to the heartbeats of the unborn son.
