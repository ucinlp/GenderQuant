In this retelling of the Cinderella story, Betty is the title character, a poor young woman forced to be the virtual slave of her two ugly stepsisters. Betty/Cinderella is visited by her fairy godmother, who grants her wish to attend the prince's ball, giving her beautiful clothes, a carriage, and the traditional glass slippers. When midnight strikes, she rushes out of the ball, leaving behind her shoe. The prince searches the land for the woman whose foot fits the slipper, and finds his "poor Cinderella." The two are married, and the ugly stepsisters are left to argue with each other until the end title's doors smack their heads together.
