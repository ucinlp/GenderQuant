Nick Murder  is an iron worker who has been married for years to Kitty , who works as a seamstress and is the mother of Nick's three daughters. While Nick loves his wife, his head is turned by Tula , a sexy lingerie salesgirl, and soon they're having a passionate affair. When Kitty discovers the infidelity, she becomes enraged and kicks him out, forcing him to decide what he really wants from life and what's most important to him. Along the way, many of the characters periodically turn to their favorite songs to explain and amplify their emotions, lip-synching along with the original recordings.
