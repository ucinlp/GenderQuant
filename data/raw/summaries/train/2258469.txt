As the film begins, a priest is shot dead on a Bridgeport, Connecticut street at night. The police, led by Chief Robinson  fail to immediately find the murderer. It soon becomes a political football, with the police accused of incompetence, and the city's reform-minded administration comes under attack. Robinson and the prosecutor Henry Harvey  come under severe pressure by political leaders to find the killer or bring in outside help. After strenuous efforts yield nothing, a vagrant ex-serviceman, John Waldron  is apprehended. He is interrogated for two days by police until, deprived of sleep, he confesses. The evidence seems solid, and a gun in his possession is believed to be the gun that was used in the shooting. Harvey, however, is not convinced. He investigates the evidence and the witnesses, then risks his reputation and incurs the wrath of the police and the public in proposing that the defendant is innocent, while he and his wife  are also being threatened by a businessman named Harris. In court, even though he is the prosecutor, Harvey lays out the flaws in the case before the judge. The charges are dismissed. A sub-plot involving Paul Harris and his involvement in a property under consideration for sale to the city - at a price Harris desperately needs to keep himself afloat - also has a prominent place in the film. Harris tries to blackmail Harvey by threatening to destroy his wife - a City Council member - unless he supports the sale and sits idle, allowing Waldron to be convicted. When a reporter gets wind of the double-dealing and threatens Harris with exposure, Harris commits suicide in the courtroom.
