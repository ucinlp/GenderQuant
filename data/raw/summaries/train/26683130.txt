Old Mother Riley gets onto a boat bound for France with her daughter Kitty,instead of taking a bus,due to a mistake by the ticket collector.They do not realize they are on a boat,and even throw all their clothes out of the cabin's porthole,thinking they are in a launderette,and the window is the washing machine.Following several other hilarious mistakes,she gets involved with the theft of The Statue of Christ from Notre Dame Cathedral replacing it with a marzipan replica and also joins in a competition of chapel singing,when she is mistaken for a nun,and wins the competition, getting a contract with Columbia Records from a priest who has connections with the music industry.Several of the boat's staff make amorous advances to Kitty,including three simultaneous Wedding proposals,each without the other's knowledge.The finale involves a custard pie fight in The Louvre.
