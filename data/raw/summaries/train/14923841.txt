A Brahman farmer somewhere from Central UP lives with his two nephews. He falls ill and is treated by a Vaidya  who comes from another village. When the farmer feels okay, he asks the Vaidya about fees. Instead, the Vaidya asks for the farmer's elder nephew as his son-in-law. The farmer readily agrees. The farmer's eldest nephew Omkar  marries the Vaidya 's elder daughter Roopa  and they start living happily. In due course, Roopa gives birth to a baby. During Roopa's pregnancy her younger sister Gunja  comes to live with her and falls in love with Omkar's younger brother Chandan . Roopa comes to know of this and assures them that she will get them married. But she dies in an accident; and nobody else knows about the love affair. The farmer and the Vaidya mutually decide to get Gunja married to Omkar so that she can take care of her sister's baby. But moments before the completion of the wedding rituals, Chandan and Gunja's affair comes to everyone's notice and the problem is resolved. Chandan marries Gunja with everybody's consent. The rural culture and dialect of Uttar Pradesh are depicted authentically in the film. The story is based on a Hindi novel, by Keshav Prasad Mishra, called "Kohbar Ki Shart". The movie captures only the first half of the novel with the change that Gunja gets married to Chandan in the movie. In the novel, the proposed marriage between Gunja and Omkar does take place and the story continues after that.
