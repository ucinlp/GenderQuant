In the opening scenes we see the murder by drowning of billionare Nerio Winch. Nerio was the founder and majority shareholder of the powerful and sprawling W group. Everyone at Group W thinks that Nerio had no family. But he had a secret he kept well-hidden: a son, Largo, adopted nearly thirty years before from a Bosnian orphanage. Largo is living the life of an adventurer and lands in Brazil, where he rescues a pretty girl from some thugs who are molesting her. After Largo and the girl have sex, she injects him with a drug and sets Largo up to be found by police. He is sent to prison. Meanwhile, back at Group W the news of Nerio's heir has the board riled up. At the same time, Mikhal Korsky, another industrialist, plans to make a takeover bid by buying up available shares of the company. Back in Brazil Largo attempts to escape from prison at the same time that his father's driver/bodyguard Freddy has come to pay Largo's way out of prison. They both escape. As he needs to prove that he is Nerio's heir, Largo has to get the shares he owns, which will make him the owner of the company. But he gets caught in a shootout in his attempt and loses his shares. He realizes that he is in the middle of a plot by Ferguson, his father's trusted second-in-command, whose aim is to take over the company. Lacking tangible proof, Largo has to prove that he is the heir before the company general meeting. Eventually Largo makes a deal with Mikhal Korsky, his enemy, to whom he reveals Ferguson's plan to ruin Korsky. Finally he reaches the board meeting and switches over Ferguson's speech to a secretly recorded video in which Ferguson admits to killing Nerio. Defeated, she leaves the meeting and is arrested. The film ends with Largo as the new head of the company.
