Will Spencer  and his friend, unsuccessful actor Tom  are former confidence tricksters who have carried out various scams, including selling London's Tower Bridge several times over. They now plan to steal a highly secret robotic Lunar Explorer and sell it to both the Chinese and Russians. With the unwilling assistance of Jarvis , a former police officer and now Will's manservant, Will's niece, a publicist with the  British Space Agency and Tom's son, a computer hacker, they put the plan into operation. They break through the Agency's security and steal the plans, but discover that the whole project is a conâ€”the vehicle exists only as a table-top model, due to budgetary constraints. To carry through the plan, they decide to construct the vehicle themselves, which they do. They produce an apparently functional vehicle out of second-hand parts and based on a motorised leaf-sweeper. The Russians are convinced enough to hand over the money, but during a chase, the vehicle falls apart and is finally sunk in a flooded quarry. The group manage to evade police, but Jarvis, who plans to take the money himself, is caught and arrested. The money is turned over the Director  of the Agency, who now plans to actually complete the project.
