Ben Mendelsohn stars as Lewis Riley, an unemployed young man who applies for a job as a director/drama teacher at a mental hospital. He lands the job and finds himself directing a production of the Mozart opera Cosi Fan Tutte. That's an elaborate, demanding piece of theatre. And it's an opera. And it's in Italian. And it's going to be performed by a cast that he must select from among the patients, who only speak English. One of the patients, Roy , sweeps everything along before him, organising auditions, selecting cast members, and criticising the director. The cast chosen include three women: Julie , Ruth , and Cherry ; and two men: Henry  and Doug . The musical director is Zac . The enthusiasm of Roy infects the group, and they charge headlong into a memorable production. Alongside the story of Lewis, the theme of Cosi Fan Tutte is explored as it relates to his personal life. Lewis's relationship with his girlfriend Lucy , already under pressure, is not helped by a friend called Nick , who seems more interested in testing Lucy's faithfulness than anything else. The story is loosely based on Nowra's own experience at producing a play  at Plenty Mental Hospital in suburban Melbourne in 1971.Teaching Australian Literature, Cosi
