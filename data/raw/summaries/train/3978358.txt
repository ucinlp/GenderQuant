Brunel, a French detective on an exchange scheme in London, is assigned to investigate the murder of novelist John Morlar. As they examine the crime scene, Brunel discovers the victim is still alive in spite of his severe injuries and has him rushed to hospital. With the help of Morlar's journals and Dr. Zonfeld, a psychiatrist Morlar was seeing, Brunel reconstructs Morlar's past life. Seen in flashback, it is filled with inexplicable catastrophes and the sudden deaths of people he disliked or who offended him. Morlar is a psychic with powerful telekinetic abilities. Disgusted at the world , Morlar has caused two recent disasters: an airliner crash into a London office tower and the loss of a manned spacecraft. From his hospital bed, he manages to bring down a cathedral on the "unworthy heads" of a VIP congregation attending a fund raising event for the crumbling building's restoration. Morlar seems able to keep himself alive by sheer willpower. As an enraged Brunel tries to kill Morlar to end the destruction Morlar writes on a pad the name of his next target: the nuclear power station at Windscale.
