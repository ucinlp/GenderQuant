A painting belonging to Duchess Blanca is stolen from a castle in Spain by the clever Jim Bourne and his partner in crime, Eve Lewis. It is stolen from the thieves, however, by Dr. Munoz, the cousin of the duchess. Eve wants to go straight, but Munoz blackmails her and Jim, demanding they steal another valuable artwork from the Prado museum. A duplicate is created by Jean Marie Calbert and a switch is planned during the farewell bullfight of a matador whom the duchess intends to wed. Munoz shoots the matador. During the ensuing chaos, Jim and Eve switch the paintings. They also find Munoz dead, killed in vengeance by the duchess. Jim is brought to justice and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Eve vows to wait for him.
