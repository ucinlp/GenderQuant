Charlie  works for a company that is taken over by Walcott  who believes family values are a priority. Career-driven Charlie does a little fibbing when under the pressure of Walcott's standards, and believes she's in the clear. But when Walcott invites himself over for dinner, she borrows her friend's house and daughter  and hires actor Buck  to play her husband for the evening. The one-night "act" turns into a full-time gig when her boss decides to rent the house next door for the summer, forcing Charlie and Buck to stay together in the fake lifestyle she created.
