Antonia Dyer is a well-to-do Englishwoman with a serious drug habit. Her heroin supply is delivered by an American motorcycle courier named Mike Stone, and before long the two of them also develop a romantic attachment. Not only does Antonia risk her life with drug use, but she is physically assaulted by a deranged police inspector named Stringer who has a particular distaste for high-society addicts.
