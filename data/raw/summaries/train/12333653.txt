Undercover San Francisco narcotics cops Sean Kane  and Dave Pierce  head into a dark alley to meet up with an informant by the name of Tony Montoya  who promises to break their big investigation wide open by providing the name of the oriental drug ringleader. Minutes later, Pierce is dead after having been shot, hit by a car, and burned. Kane gets into trouble with his boss, Captain Stevens , for sending one of the killers flying out a third story window to his death in full public view right after the incident. Rather than face discipline, and told to keep his distance by his superiors, Kane now decides to quit the force, and sets out to exact vengeance. Kane is not the only one who is angry; Daveâ€™s girlfriend, reporter Linda Chan , is too, and she vows to bring the drug gang down herself by way of investigative reporting and public exposure. However, when Linda uncovers the secret that Kane and Pierce never found, she, too, is killed. Now Kane is not just angry; he is furious, and so is Linda's grieving father James Chan . Kane vows to get to the bottom of things himself and bring down the drug gang, which is led by Morgan Canfield .
