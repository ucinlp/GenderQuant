Claude Massoulier is murdered while hunting at the same place as Julien Vercel , an estate agent who knew him and whose fingerprints are found on Massoulier's car. As the police discover that Marie-Christine Vercel , Julien's wife, was Massoulier's mistress, Julien is the prime suspect. But his secretary, Barbara Becker , while not quite convinced he is innocent, defends him and leads her private investigations.
