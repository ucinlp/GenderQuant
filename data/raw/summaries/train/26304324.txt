Kunjoonjamma Thomas ([[Padmini  is a widow who is living in a village alone. People always make fun of her because she is grumpy and depressed due to the deaths of her husband and only child. Village children irritate her by ringing her door bell and running away. One day, her grand daughter Gaily , whom she had never met, visits her. Initially, Kunjoonjamma does not like Gaily, but they soon become close to each other. Kunjoonjamma takes down the door bell, saying to Gaily that its only purpose was for Gaily's return. Now that Gaily is with her she does not need it. Kunjoonjamma's neighbor, Sreekumar , falls in love with Gaily. One day, Sreekumar's friend, played by Fazil, comes to his house and finds Gaily. He identifies her as a missing girl from Delhi, and immediately informs her father  about her whereabouts. Gaily had run away from Delhi because she had a brain disease and does not have much time to live. She wanted to enjoy the rest of her life. When her fathers comes to take her back to Delhi for an urgent operation, she refuses to go, claiming that even the doctors are not sure whether the operation will be a success. Finally, her grandmother mixes sleeping pills in soup and gives it to Gaily, and her father takes her to Delhi while she is unconscious. The movie ends with the ambulance slowly fading away to darkness. Sreekumar watches it leave, and when he turns away he sees Kunjoonjamma replacing the door bell with a sense of hope that Gaily will one day return.
