In Nelsonville, Ohio in 1956, the relationship between the introverted, clumsy Jonathan Bellah  and the nonconformist, extroverted Gene Harbrough  begins to develop. Jonathan's main objective is to win over the sexy Marilyn McCauley , in spite of his shyness, while Gene has his own love-life to maintain with his girlfriend Bunny Miller &mdash;as well as counseling Jonathan on how to attract women. Gene also has to defend himself from the class bully, Kenny , while trying to work out a borderline relationship with his widowed father, who has zero tolerances for his often wild escapades. Also, some scenes shot in Canal Winchester, Baltimore, Carroll and Lithopolis, Ohio.
