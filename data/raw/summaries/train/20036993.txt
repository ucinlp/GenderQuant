This Guatemalan film tells a story of three middle-class teenagers on a high-octane ride to hell outside the safety of their colonia. They siphon gas from their neighbors cars and roam the streets, looking for any and every form of entertainment, but they soon learn that even the simplest actions can have consequences way beyond anything they imagined, and some lessons are learned too late.
