On D-Day, a mixed group of forced labourers held by German forces take shelter from the bombardment inside a German bunker, but are then entombed when the entrances are blocked by shelling damage. By coincidence, the bunker is a store house and they have enough food and wine to last them for years. And they are trapped for years. The film analyzes how they deal with their underground prison, with their relationships, and with death.
