Mum and Day Hayseed are visited by an archaeologist fresh from university, Owen Osborne, looking for signs of prehistoric people in nearby caves. They go through a cave and discover a secret valley which is home to an lost tribe, who have never been in contact with the outside world, wear skins for clothing, and are surrounded by diamonds. Dad Hayseed makes friends with Wup  who plays an ancient form of golf and Owen falls in love with the Wup daughter, the beautiful Golden Girl , rescuing her from an unwanted suitor, Beetle Brows. This leads to a rising of an opposing clan, and the Wups flee to civilisation with the Hayseeds. They go to Sydney and have various adventures, including a trip to the Randwick Races. Olive is kidnapped by Beetle Brows but the Hayseeds and Owen save the day."PREHISTORIC HAYSEEDS." The Register  24 Dec 1923: 14
