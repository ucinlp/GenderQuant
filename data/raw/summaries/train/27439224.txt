In 1909 Arizona, Captain Sam Burgade has retired from law enforcement, the Arizona Rangers. Hoping for peace and quiet, he suddenly learns that his old enemy Zach Provo has escaped from a Yuma prison with other convicts. Years before, Burgade was shot by Provo and barely survived, but later sent Provo to prison. Out for revenge, Provo does not go after a cash shipment as Burgade expects but instead kidnaps Burgade's daughter, Susan. The six escaped men form an ambush. Provo allows two of them who lust after Susan to sexually assault her, assuming Burgade will show himself in an attempt to rescue her. Burgade has been knocked unconscious, however, and is unable to intervene. Setting a fire to smoke out the fugitives, Burgade is able to dispose of them one by one until only Provo is left. But he finds himself at gunpoint, then is shot by Provo several times and about to die when he is able to retaliate at last.
