Petty crook Marlowe kidnaps Jonathan Chester, the young son of wealthy industrialist Anthony Chester, and locks him in an abandoned house. He then goes to see the boy's father and announces that he will only reveal his whereabouts once he has been paid Â£50,000  and is safely in Brazil. The boy's nanny alerts the police and Inspector Parnell arrives to discourage Chester from paying up least it send out a signal to give in to blackmailers. Marlowe then reveals that a bomb is also in the house where Jonathan is kept and will go off at 10 a.m. the next day. This is too much for Chester who attacks Marlowe causing the crook serious injuries from which he later dies, leaving the police with little time or indications as to where to find Jonathan.
