A fat cop and an aristocratic lady are walking down the road, talking about one's own livelihood. On the way, they found Krazy sticking his head inside a small theater box. On the other side of the box, a rat was tossing rocks at Krazy's head but the cat appears to be enjoying it. The suspicious cop went around and eventually notices the reality before arresting the rat. The cop imprisons the rat and walks away in celebration. Despite the rat's malicious treatment, Krazy felt sorry and decides to break the rodent out of the slammer. The na√Øve cat offers the rat a pie which conceals carpentry tools. The rat uses the tools to demolish the prison to the ground. But in doing so, another criminal was released. That other criminal ran into the open and begins harassing the aristocratic lady. The cop struggles to intervene. For some reason, the rat decided to help out the cop by taking a machine gun and firing it at the criminal. The criminal was taken down, and the aristocratic lady was safe. Though he escaped prison, the rat, nonetheless, received a handshake from the cop for the assistance. As they go their separate ways, the rat saw Krazy joyously dancing around. He finds a square rock and throws it at Krazy, knocking the cat unconscious. The cop, who wasn't too faraway, saw the deed, and chases the rat into the horizon.
