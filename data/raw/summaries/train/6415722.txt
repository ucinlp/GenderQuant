Francisco Mega , a clerk at the then leading department stores of Lisbon, "Grandes Armazéns do Grandella", is in love with Tatão , who works in front at "Perfumaria da Moda". Tatão, however, is a cinephile who largely ignores him, whereas Francisco is also an amateur theatre player; so his amateur theatre company, the Grandellinhas, uses its rehearsals of the play O Pai Tirano  to present Francisco as a son who split from his tyrant father for love, and woo Tatão.
