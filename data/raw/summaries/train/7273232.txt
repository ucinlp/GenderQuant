The Hammond family has been cursed since the Crusades, with family members dying or committing suicide under mysterious circumstances. When two people, including Oliver Hammond ([[John Howard  are attacked by an unknown creature, Robert Curtis ([[James Ellison  and his sidekick Christy  are dispatched to investigate. Although the local townspeople are convinced that the attacks are the result of a curse upon the Hammond family, Curtis believes that he will be able to find a more scientific explanation for the attacks. Curtis' investigation at the Hammond household reveals a number of unusual circumstances, including slamming doors and clanking chains, a recently-entered secret room that had supposedly been locked for years, and a statue of a strange dog-like creature in the Hammond family crypt. During his investigation, one of the initial victims of the attack dies  and the case is sent to an English jury for judgement. Upon hearing testimony from members of the Hammond family and their associates, the jury rules that the victim died at the hand of an unknown person or creature of unknown species. After the ruling, Curtis decides to look for evidence upon the body of the victim. He finds a hair that he later identifies as being from a wolf, but the hair disappears mysteriously soon after he analyzes it. The monster attacks again at the end of the movie, this time kidnapping Helga Hammond ([[Heather Angel , but Curtis and the police chase him down. When the monster is finally shot, it transforms into a human being and we discover that it is actually Oliver Hammond. Afterwards, Dr. Jeff Colbert , a friend of the Hammonds, reveals that they have been afflicted with lycanthropy for generations - that is, they are werewolves - and he had been attempting to cure them of the disease.
