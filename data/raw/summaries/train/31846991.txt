In an interview with Xtranormal, J Roland Kelly describes the film as "...basically this absurd, funny conversation between a guy and his girlfriend. He tells her he fantasizes about her twin sister, but she doesn’t have a twin sister, so it’s just another way of fantasizing about her… and is she offended. [It draws on] some La Nouvelle Vague & Mumblecore elements from the kind of films I was watching at the time."
