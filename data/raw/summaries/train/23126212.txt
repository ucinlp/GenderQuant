A group of Americans, none of whom have any experience in raising large ships from the sea bed, are hired to raise the famous Belfast-built ocean liner RMS Titanic from the North Atlantic. They hope to obtain a rare mineral that the US Armed Forces can use for a sound beam that can take down missiles as they enter US airspace. The Soviet Union also wants to salvage the vast ship because they claim they own the rare mineral.
