Odile , a business executive, is married to weak, furtive Claude . In the past Odile was close to successful businessman Nicolas , now married with kids and returning to Paris after an eight-year absence. She is looking for a new, bigger apartment from estate agent Marc . Her younger sister Camille , has just completed her doctoral thesis in history and is a Paris tour guide. Simon  is a regular on Camille's tours because he's attracted to her, although he claims to be researching his historical radio dramas. Camille has fallen for Marc, and they begin an affair. Nicolas is also looking for an apartment, since he hopes to eventually have his family join him in Paris. The most original feature of this "musical" is that characters break into songs as sung by the original artists, i.e. depending on the circumstances, a female character may all of a sudden start singing in a male voice and vice versa. The judicious choice of songs and variety of styles make for some very funny surprises, considering the complete and voluntary absence of transitions between the talking and singing. The film's debt to Dennis Potter is acknowledged with a dedication in the opening credits.
