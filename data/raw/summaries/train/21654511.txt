{{ref improve section|datePart OnePhoto of main characters|The first two primary characters of Half-Life: Escape from City 17, potrayed by Derek Chan  and Ian Purchase. The Citadel can be seen in the background.]] --> Part One is set during the second half of events of Half-Life 2: Episode One. Dr. Isaac Kleiner is making his "Kleinercasts" on City 17's PA system, warning that the Combine Citadel is set to explode at any moment; should the Citadel detonate, the resulting explosion will destroy the city and the surrounding area. Prior to the film's events, Gordon Freeman's actions within the Citadel have held down the impending explosion, opening a small window of time for civilians to escape. Members of the Lambda Resistance are seen fighting their way out of the city as the Combine's Civil Protection forces try to hold them back. CP officers are also seen executing captured rebels, while Combine synths wreak havoc on the warzone. Two male Resistance members  are introduced escaping through an overrun trainyard. Through radio communication, the two learn from a third rebel  that the last evacuation train has already left, and are urged to escape the city on foot through the canal system  in order to catch up with David, who is en route to the Resistance stronghold of White Forest. After a brief argument, the two resolve to escape City 17 before "the Citadel blows us up first". Suddenly, CP officers appear and fire on the Resistance members. The two retaliate with their own weaponry  and manage to escape. They are eventually caught upon an open stretch of railway, where a Hunter-Chopper appears and fires at them, giving chase. The duo disappear behind a cloud of dirt from the wake of the chopper's mounted gun, and the film abruptly cuts to black.
