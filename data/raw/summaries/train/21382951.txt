Mourning her husband's recent death, Dr. Belinda Simpson ([[Sarah Jones  arrives in the tiny town of Sikeston to fill the post of town physician. Once there she discovers that many of the townâ€™s residents, including children at an orphanage run by Miss Hattie Clarence , have fallen ill or died from an unknown ailment. She soon wonders if she's in over her head, despite reassurances from her best friend Annie  and Lee, the town blacksmith. Sikeston's residents are distrustful of Belinda's abilities as a doctor because she's a woman. Many of them don't even want her to help the orphans, whom they blame for infecting the rest of the town; some would be happy to see the orphanage close altogether. Opposed by what seems like the entire town, Belinda must trust in her abilities, her friends, and her faith to guide her.
