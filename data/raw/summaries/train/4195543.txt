She is discovered by her pretentious playwright niece, Camille , and Camille's eccentrically odd and adorably shy younger sister, Cora , who plot to set the suicide up as a murder to preserve the family's reputation and ensconce themselves in the family mansion. The family of eccentrics is rounded out by Cora's wayward outlaw of a daughter, Emma . Emma has a love interest and inept jailer, Jason . The key suspect is Willis , Cookie's handyman, who happens to have cleaned the guns the night before Cookie's death.
