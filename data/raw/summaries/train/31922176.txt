The story takes a turn when Surya goes to Saudi to celebrate the birthday of Sri and is shocked when the Saudi police arrest Sri on charges of murdering Vaishnavi. He is sentenced to death. Now, the only way for Surya is to get the signature from Vaishnavi’s parents to acquit Sri. And that happens to be Raja Goud , the bad guy whom Surya has been fighting all along.
