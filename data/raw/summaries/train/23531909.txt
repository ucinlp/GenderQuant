The film follows the exploits of Sam Boyd , a former operative for the CIA who is reactivated to escort Pyotr Ivanovich Grushenko , a captured KGB mole, to a prisoner exchange in recently reunited Berlin. The exchange is actually a cover for a CIA plot to use drug cartel money to buy back Benjamin Sobel ([[Bob Sherman , a U-2 pilot who was shot down over the Soviet Union during the 1960s. The exchange goes wrong after Boyd recognizes the supposedly imprisoned Sobel as a man he saw two days before at Dulles Airport, and is subsequently told by Grushenko that it really is Sobel, who is now a KGB agent. The two agents are forced to go on the run from both Boyd's own Company superiors  and the head of the KGB , who all wish to see the exchange completed for reasons that are both obvious and not so obvious. Their only hope may lie in Natasha Grimaud , a mysterious French beauty from Grushenko's past.
