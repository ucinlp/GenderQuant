The brothers Mokong and Bubuli  have feelings for the rich sisters Honey Grace and Barbie Doll , Mokong for Honey Grace and Bubuli for Barbie Doll. Don Robert doesnâ€™t like the brothers because they are poor. So that they can be free to court Honey Grace and Barbie Doll, Mokong and Bubuli climb over the fence. Don Robert always makes plans to prevent Mokong and Bubuli to get close to his daughters. Nonetheless, he fails due to the intervention of his mortal enemy and former girlfriend, Aling Lucring who happens to be Mokong and Bubuli's overprotective mother. As a result, total mayhem ensues between the two families. A running gag of the series is that in the end of every episode, two policemen, Officers Tedera and Officer Ginto, arrest Don Robert based on whatever schemes he had concocted. As Don Robert tries to explain his way out of this arrest, the police officers always tell him, "Sa presinto ka na lang magpaliwanag."  Those words have now become a semi-common Filipino catchphrase.
