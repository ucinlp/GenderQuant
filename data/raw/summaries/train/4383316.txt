Billy "Hurricane" Smith  is a construction worker in Marshall, Texas. Mourning his mother's death, Billy goes to Australia to find his missing sister. His search takes him to the swank pad of a pimp, Shanks , and one of his hookers, Julie , who both knew Billy's sister. Billy is tortured by his sister's former employer, crime boss Charlie Dowd , who is secretly waging a turf war against his partner Howard Fenton , and Billy is not about to blow town without finding his sisterâ€”and then Billy discovers that his sister was murdered by Charlie. Not only does Shanks endure a savage beating to help Billy, but Shanks is also killed when they storm Charlie's mansion in search of the now-kidnapped Julie. Ever busy Charlie has already blown up Howard in an explosion which almost killed Billy, and has murdered his own girlfriend just to eliminate loose ends. With the SWAT team called in, Charlie uses Julie as a shield after his men are wiped out. Charlie commandeers a chopper. Climbing onto the bottom of the chopper, which flies over a part of the ocean, Billy throws Charlie into the water below, where Charlie is killed by a swarm of sharks. Billy is now free to make plans to bring Julie stateside, where they will not run into any of her former customers.
