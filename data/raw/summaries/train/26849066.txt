Kerry Wells , a college student journalist and committed Christian has been assigned to do a story on Blake Truman  the college's hockey superstar. Blake struggles with personal crisis but rejects Kerry's reliance on her faith. He is convinced that modern science has disproved the Bible and especially the Genesis story of creation. Together they discover that the creation story and science may be in perfect accord. The Genesis Code takes on three current social and cultural issues: Evolution vs. creation, End-of-life decisions and perceived discrimination against Christians on the college campus.http://thegenesiscodemovie.com/ Though this becomes a romance story, it gives a look to the age old question of how science and a book of the Bible, Genesis, may both be "correct" and told in a format that a normal layperson will understand.
