The story follows the insertion of covert British Commandos into Norway to rescue Norwegian General Heden from captivity and to return him to England to lead the Free Norwegian Forces. The film opens with the execution of a British spy who was sent to support partisan activities. A small man team is assembled which consists of Capt. Robert Owen, a Canadian, Sgt. Harry Hall, a Briton and a Norwegian called Lt. Erik Falken. The team parachutes in and soon after arriving Falken is recognised by a local woman who reports them to her German lover and Dalberg a puppet of the German authorities. A team is sent to capture them but after they overpower their captors and free the general from the prison camp they are soon being pursued by the German authorities. Once on the road in a captured German car they are attacked and forced to take shelter after Heden is hurt. They send Falken to get assistance from a doctor but he is betrayed once again by the same woman whom he had known when growing up in his hometown. The Germans take Falken alive and, pretending to be the doctor they requested, capture Owen near the house they are hiding in. Hall manages to keep Heden in safety in the house. Owen misleads the Germans about their escape plans and after the Germans have realised their mistake they are surprised to find that the two prisoners have been freed by Dalberg. Owen and Falken manages to return to Hall and Heden and the party moves off to rendezvous with the incoming commandos and Royal Navy boats. The film includes real footage from the raids on German occupying forces in Norway carried out by the British Commandos in March and December of 1941.
