Gold-digging chorus girl Mary  marries the head of a bootlegging syndicate, gangster "Shoots" Magiz , but the illegal liquor business goes down the drain when Prohibition is repealed, and Shoots is knocked off by rival Daniel Dingle . Mary, looking for a new sugar-daddy, hooks up with Dingle, and when Dingle is removed from the scene by Mickey "The Greek" Mikapopoulis , transfers her attention to him in return for a "trust fund". All the time, fast-talking straight-shooter Jimmy "Office Boy" Burnham , Shoots' former bodyguard and errand boy, has looked after Mary, passing her advice and snappy remarks whenever they're needed. In the end, Mary and Office Boy end up together, but only after "Merry Widow Mary" gives away all the dirty money she was given.Erickson, Hal Plot synopsisTCM Full synopsis
