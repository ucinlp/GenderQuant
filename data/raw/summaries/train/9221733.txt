He blackmails her into eventually tolerating his increasingly aggressive physical sexual harassments. It all culminates one night before she marries his father. During the night the electricity goes off. As his father and older brother are away, and with his younger brother asleep, Nino approaches his housekeeper with a flashlight and orders her to undress. She gives in after an initial physical protest, but runs away after finishing undressing. Nino chases her with the flashlight until he accidentally drops it. With the flashlight in her own hands, Angela decides it is time to turn the tables. She blinds Nino with the flashlight and when he tries to reach for it, she pins him to a nearby bed and has sex with him while rushing him to "Fotti! Fotti!" . With Nino finally losing control over her, she marries his father the following day and his father instructs Nino to refer to her as "Mamma" from then on.{{cite web}}
