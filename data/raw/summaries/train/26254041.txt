{{Expand section}} A Chicago youth, Nick Conover , in trouble with the criminal justice system for joyriding, has been released on probation with a special condition that he lives and works on the Kentucky farm of his distant aunt Henrietta and uncle Jed Bruce , and does not get in any further trouble. There, in the middle of nowhere, Nick is forlorn, especially as his uncle does not welcome him with open arms. Nick finds that sulky horse racing is the popular pastime in this area of the country. Although initially his preference is to race and repair hot-rod cars, he finds he has an innate connection with the only remaining horse on the farm. A local lass  teaches him much about the sport and "April love" ensues.
