Kevin Bacon's character, Joe Hickey, is a man who is apparently in the business of kidnapping rich people's children for ransom with his wife Cheryl  and cousin Marvin as his accomplices. Will Jennings , the father/husband in a typical happy family, is a research physician who has just had his big career break by patenting a new anesthetic drug. The mother/wife, Karen Jennings  is a stay at home mother who used to be a nurse. The couple's daughter Abby  is kidnapped by Hickey and Marvin. Meanwhile Cheryl keeps Will at gunpoint and tells him about his daughter's kidnapping after he just gets out of a ceremony in which he is honored for his career. The movie then follows the tense situation lived by the couple, separated by the bandits and kept in the dark as to what the outcome of their predicament is to be. The situation is worsened by a health problem of the child  about which the kidnappers were uninformed.
