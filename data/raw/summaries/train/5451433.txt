Mammootty is a sincere district collector. A female leader of a major political party is kidnapped by a terrorist Veeraiyan and he promises to return her back if his injured brother Arasappan  is treated well and brought back safely. The government agrees to this condition and asks Mammootty to look after Arasappan. At first;Arasappan hates Mammootty and his family as Mammootty works for the government against whom his brother's group is rebelling. But;the kindness shown by Mammootty's wife and mother change his attitude. Just when he was about to turn over a new leaf; a bad thing occurs. The police team;without taking the necessary orders from Mammootty go to the forest and attack Veeraiyan's gathering. This angers Arasappan;but he was restrained by Mammootty. Now;the police accuse Mammootty of having links with the terrorists as Arasappan ran away from his house and Mammootty condemned the police action. Hence;they arrest Mammootty's wife and mother.  Hearing this sad news; Arasappan himself surrenders to the police as he did not want them to suffer for him. But the police do not spare him despite his surrender.
