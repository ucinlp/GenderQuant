Upon learning that Mr. Pratt, the mean old school board chairman, has fired their beloved teacher Miss Pipps because she threw a birthday party for one of her students during class, the gang decides to invite their parents to a special performance of a play exposing Pratt's injustices in running the school. As a result, he's demoted to caretaker, while Mr. Swenson is justifiably promoted to Pratt's former position...and Miss Pipps returns. Yet, compassion is shown to Mr. Pratt when his birthday is honored.
