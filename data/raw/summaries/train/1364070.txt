CBS cameraman Harry Hinkle  gets injured when football player Luther "Boom Boom" Jackson  runs into him while he is covering a Browns game at Cleveland Stadium. Hinkle's injuries are minor, but his conniving lawyer brother-in-law "Whiplash Willie" Gingrich  convinces him to pretend that his legs have been paralyzed. This way, they can receive a huge indemnity from the insurance company.A large amount for its time, the settlement is one million dollars. Hinkle reluctantly goes along with the scheme because he's still in love with his ex-wife, Sandy, and it might win her back. The insurance company suspects that the paralysis is a fake one, and so a cat-and-mouse game begins between its investigator, Chester Purkey, and the shyster Gingrich. Jackson takes very good care of Hinkle, who begins having second thoughts as he witnesses guilt taking its toll on Jackson. As he also sees that Sandy is back by his side strictly out of greed, Hinkle decides to reveal the truth, thereby ruining Gingrich's get-rich plans.
