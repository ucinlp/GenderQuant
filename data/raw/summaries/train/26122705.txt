A slaughterhouse worker, Serge Pilardosse , retires from the job he has held for many years. His colleagues throw him an impromptu party and give him a gift. Once home he begins to quickly become restless before his wife persuades him to go and see about claiming a pension. At the pensions office he discovers that even though he has never missed a day's work for illness, nor been unemployed, he cannot claim a pension due to a few gaps in his pensions history. He goes home where his wife persuades him to use his old motorbike to go and search for the missing papers so that the pensions claim can be processed. He goes to his garage where he takes the sheet off a motorbike, revealing it to be a Münch Mammut, from which he gets his nickname "Mammuth", and leaves on his journey to collect the documents he needs. Over the course of his journey he loses his way, reliving memories from his past and especially his girlfriend from many years ago who died in a motorcycle accident. He visits his old places of employment, old friends and family—including his estranged brother where he meets his niece who introduces him to the world of naïve art. Realising that people saw him as a bit of an idiot, he returns to his brother's house and his niece takes him into her world where he re-discovers himself and the poet within. Eventually he visits the scene of the accident to place a remembrance bouquet and shakes off the memories, finally freeing himself. He returns to his wife newly invigorated.
