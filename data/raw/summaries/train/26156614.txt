The story takes place in Arkansas. It is based around the story of Chrystal, a woman who has become permanently injured, emotionally detached, and mentally unstable stemming from several traumatic events in her past. The movie begins in a rather dramatic fashion, depicting Joe fleeing from the police in a high speed police chase. While weaving down the roads at a high rate of speed, Joe loses control of the vehicle and ends up rolling down a hill and, subsequently, crashing into a tree. Chrystal is severely injured in the accident, suffering a broken neck. Their son, who the police presumed was flung through the windshield, was never found at the scene of the accident, or anywhere in the surrounding areas. For his role in running from the police and causing injuries to his passengers, Joe is arrested and sentenced to imprisonment for 16 years.{{cite web}} Upon his release from prison, Joe comes back to his home in search of a change in his life. He ends up coming back home to his wife, who hadn't divorced him even while he was away in prison. Because of the accident suffered from Joe's run-in with the law, and the resulting accident and loss of their child, Chrystal is permanently injured in her neck and has completely lost her enthusiasm, emotions, or will to live. As Joe begins to slowly work his way back into her life, she is unsure of whether to accept him once again, fearing what may happen if she does so. He now wants to change and atone for his past life of crime. Forced to face his past to continue with his future, Joe runs into an old enemy of his, Snake . Worried about him, Snake invites Joe to rejoin him in his illegal drug operation.{{cite web}}
