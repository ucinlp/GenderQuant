Michael Rogers , a young drifter currently employed as a chauffeur, has a chance meeting with the lovely Ellie Thomsen . He dreams of building a magnificent house on a particular spot of land along the Devon coast. Unknown to him, she is actually a wealthy heiress and can make his dream come true. With the help of her efficient German companion, Greta , they marry and build a memorable home designed by noted architect Santonix , much to the disapproval of Ellie's family, who try to buy off Michael. However, the land the couple purchased is known as "Gypsy's Acre" and is said to carry a curse. Mysterious accidents pile up, a self-proclaimed gypsy haunts the grounds, and after a midnight accident, Greta moves in with the couple to nurse Ellie back to health, to the resentment of Michael. A further equestrian accident results in the death of Ellie, and Michael is shattered. With the aid of her lawyer "Uncle" Andrew  and Greta, Michael pulls together. But he remains haunted by ghostly images of Ellie and a devious murder plot--and another death--are revealed in the finale.British Film Institute
