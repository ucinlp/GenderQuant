Juhi is an ageing prostitute who has a wheelchair bound son, Kaku, to take care of with the limited number of customers that now find her attractive. Debu, a not so successful lyricist, gets dumped by his boyfriend, and is out on streets. These characters, in need of money, in need of love, bump into each other, after which their lives take a similar direction. Their relationships, born out of mutual needs, change their perceptions about each other, which in turn brings a change in them, finally, a sunny day after days of merciless downpour.<ref name http://gapersblock.com/ac/2010/10/04/chicago-south-asian-film-festival-part-one |title October 4, 2010 |workAmy Dittmeier }}
