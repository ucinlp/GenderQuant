A man throws away an old television set on a New York City street, but after he walks away the TV turns on and releases a multicolored cloud of pixels. The cloud floats through the city, then breaks off and becomes tremendous versions of classic 8-bit video games, that all start destroying the city. Whenever something in the city is hit or affected by the pixel creatures, it becomes pixelated too. * Aliens from Space Invaders attack cars, which are turned into pixels and crumble. * Pac-Man is shown traveling down a subway map, where all the stations look like white pellets from the game. As he eats each one, we see the real station disappear.  * Next, giant Tetris blocks fall from the sky, stacking onto geometric buildings. When one floor is completed, it disappears. * A swarm of paddles from Arkanoid play against the bricks of the Brooklyn Bridge, slowly destroying it. * At the top of the Empire State Building is Donkey Kong, who launches huge barrels into the streets below. * Frogger is seen crossing a busy New York highway, he is the only video game creature that doesn't cause any damage. A variety of company logos of the era appear in advertisements: Commodore Business Machines and Psygnosis on subway entrances, and Atari on a skyscraper. At the end, a giant bomb appears in the streets. When it explodes, the shock wave slowly turns the whole city in pixels, then it spreads throughout the world, and soon Earth is nothing but a giant cube pixel, silently floating through space, which dooms the human existence. The end of the credits are presented as a high score.
