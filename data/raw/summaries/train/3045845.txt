 In 1925 Damascus, the natives are engaged in a guerrilla war against the French rule of Syria. Harry Smith  is an amoral American black marketeer secretly selling them weapons. As the situation deteriorates, French General LaSalle  orders that civilians be executed each time his soldiers are killed, but his head of military intelligence, Colonel Feroud , persuades him to rescind the plan. Feroud presses for negotiations with rebel leader Emir Hassan  instead. LaSalle reluctantly lets him try to arrange a meeting, but refuses to let Feroud make contact directly. The young officer sent in his place is later found with his throat cut. To complicate matters, Harry makes a pass at Feroud's unhappy mistress, Violetta , but she rejects him. Later, she informs Feroud she wants to leave him, but he refuses to let her go. By applying pressure to Balukjian , one of Harry's friendly rivals, Feroud finds out about Harry's gun running. Harry is tipped off, just as Violetta shows up and begs him to take her back to Cairo. Needing to flee himself, he agrees to take her along. However, a French patrol nearly captures Harry. He barely gets away, but has to leave behind his money, and without that, he is soon betrayed to the French. Facing execution, Harry agrees to help Feroud meet with Hassan. Hassan calls the colonel a fool and dismisses his plea for negotiations, but decides to spare his life when Harry and Feroud's aide Major Leon  show up offering a 10,000 pound ransom. The officers are allowed to leave; Harry is not so lucky. The rebels are angered that he has revealed the location of their headquarters to the French and fear he has sold them out, so they kill him. As Feroud and Leon walk back, they notice that the incessant gunfire and explosions have stopped. Feroud wonders aloud if he has convinced Hassan to be as big a fool.
