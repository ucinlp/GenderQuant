In Heaven, the last ten years have been toughâ€”Hell has been winning the battle between Good and Evil. The managers of Heaven receive a request by a mother to save her son's soul and see the possibility of winning the soul of a boxer named Many  as an opportunity to shift the balance of power. Although Many is severely in debt and is even thinking of suicide, Lola , an angel, is sent to Earth to take over the role of the boxer's wife. To counter this, Hell's manager Jack Davenport  decides to send one of his more troublesome agents, Carmen , who was a male ex-gangster punished by being converted into a waitress, to fight back by impersonating Many's cousin. Though it starts out as a simple fight between heaven and hell for the soul of one man, a conspiracy in Hell and conflicting emotions interrupt the war between saints and sinners. Many is overprotective of Lola and after looking through the porn magazines that Carmen loved to browse through when she was still a man, he suspects a relationship between Lola and Carmen. Suddenly Many's soul becomes increasingly important and his weakened physical state creates a deadline by which he must go to Hell or Heaven. It is the job of the supernatural agents to tempt or save Many. The obstinate womanizing boxer inconsistently shows signs of regret and change, for example when he writes a letter of apology to his mother but doesn't send it. His ups and downs make it a hard job for both Carmen and Lola.
