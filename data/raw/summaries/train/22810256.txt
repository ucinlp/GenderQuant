In four episodes, Suleiman recounts family stories inspired by his father Fuad's private diaries starting from when he was a resistance fighter in 1948, and his motherâ€™s letters to family members who were forced to leave the country during the same period. In addition, Suleiman also combines his own memories in an attempt to provide a portrait of the daily life of the Palestinians who were labeled "Israeli-Arabs" after they chose to remain in their country and become a minority.
