The cartoon opens with a car driving up near a farm for a picnic and a man coming out and the dog Charlie coming out shortly after him. The man throws a stick, and when Charlie is off getting it, the man packs up and leaves in his car, deliberately leaving the dog behind. After Charlie is dumped, he tries various tricks to attract new owners from the people driving along the road. After three failures in various ways, he hears Porky singing and decides to go talk to him. He annoys Porky though as he says he is 50 % various dogs but is mostly a Labrador Retriever. He eventually drives Porky crazy and is kicked off his property. A series of gags then ensues with Charlie trying to become Porky's dog, with them all failing until Porky is about to kick Charlie out but is stopped by a nearby humane society worker, who is spying on Porky, who does not want to get in trouble with the law. Porky then sings Rock-a-bye Baby as he carries Charlie back and puts Charlie down. After the Humane Society worker leaves, Porky demands that Charlie leaves, but Charlie sadly and dramatically pleads Porky not to kick him out, as he always wanted to live in the country, and not the city, while Porky finally feels ashamed of himself and his actions: :Charlie Dog: All my life I've dreamed of the day I could go and live in the country. I'm not strong. I need lots of fresh air, and milk, and cream... [Coughs] a-a-and fresh leafy vehgeh-tables! [Sobs] :Porky: B-b-b-but I - :Charlie Dog: Good, clean, wholesome farm living! [Sobs] :Porky: B-b-b-but I - :Charlie Dog: And now... [Sniffs] Now... Now that I got a chance to regain my health, you wanna send me back to the city. Da city! I can see it all now. It's high towers! Cold, cruel, ominous! Closin' down on ya! From every side till ya can't breathe! Closer! Closer! [Begins to choke] Ya can't breathe...! Da traffic! Ya can't think! BEE-BEEP! BEE-BEEP! LOOK OUT FOR THAT TRUCK! HONK HONK! LOOK OUT FOR THAT TAXI! BOINGGG! BREEP-BREEP! ARROOOGAH! HONK HONK! BEE-BEEP! Ah! ... Hark. What's that? Look! It's the towers! THEY'RE FALLING! AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!" [Collapses onto ground] Porky finally feels sorry for Charlie's traumatic experience in the city and tricks Charlie (who makes a Trollface and an [[Troll  into accepting him as a pet and puts him in a "sleeping bag"  which he promptly shuts and sends Charlie off to Scotland in it. However, when Porky returns Charlie is there in Scottish attire complete with a bagpipe and he eventually drives Porky into accepting him as a pet with the bagpipe's annoying music. Porky promptly suggests a picnic afterwards and he decides to head to the middle of a desert to do it. As Porky unpacks the food and calls Charlie out to catch the stick he has, Charlie comes running out. Porky proceeds to throw the stick and Charlie runs to the car instead of going after the stick and drives off, deliberately leaving Porky behind. Porky then becomes angry and starts going crazy, acting a like a dog and is picked up by the county dog catcher, who picks him up and puts him in the back with the other dogs where he barks with them as the cartoon irises out.
