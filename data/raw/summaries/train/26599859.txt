The film tells the story of Sankara Narayanan, a 55-year-old gangman from the Indian Railways. From his teenage days onward he was afraid of the strange voices that talked to him incessantly. To escape the fear, he seeks refuge in alcohol, alienating himself from his family and ending up in an asylum. His son Ramu could never sympathise with a father who had shirked his responsibility as a husband and a father. But Narayanan starts writing letters from the asylum, to which Ramu doesnâ€™t even bother to reply. A young doctor tries to help Sankara Narayanan, for he knows that he can be cured. The doctor not only intends to reunite Narayanan with his family but also has something very important to reveal to Ramu.
