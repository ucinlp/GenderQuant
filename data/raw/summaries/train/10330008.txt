A mouse-like clerk in a Scottish Tweed weaving company  cleverly bests the brash modern American efficiency expert  whose ideas threaten his way of life. The new owner of the Tweed company, played by Robert Morley, is engaged [not actually specified, an assumption by the company staff ?] to a frightful American woman who's an efficiency expert and wants to turn her hand to revolutionise the very old fashioned company. She even contemplates synthetic fibres. She insists on visiting the factory and there's a scene where she emerges from the landrover on a Scottish island at the Crofters cottage where they spin the wool. Eventually Peter Sellers decides he must kill her. As he's a non smoker and a non drinker he decides he should cover up his tracks by smoking and drinking at the scene of the crime, purchasing bottle of whisky and packet of Capstan cigarettes, disdaining the filter tipped Kingsway visible in the shop. Of course he doesn't succeed and eventually removes the cigarettes and drink and clears off. She is then regarded as clearly deranged for saying that he called round and smoked, and is taken off the case. Thus Sellers wins his battle of the sexes. But seeing her crying at the station is minded to buy her some flowers. He may have won the battle, but hasn't won the war.
