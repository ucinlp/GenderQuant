Nine-year-old Evelyn Doyle's  mother has abandoned the family, leaving her out-of-work father Desmond Doyle  to bring up Evelyn and her two brothers, Maurice  and Dermot  on his own. Matters are only made worse when Desmond's mother-in-law  reports the abandonment of the children to the authorities. Irish law prohibits children from being brought up in a "broken home", and therefore places these children in Church-run orphanages. Desmond also drinks excessively and does not have a job or money to allow him to support his children. His two sons are placed in a boys-only orphanage, while his daughter is placed in a girls-only orphanage. Vowing to reunite his family, Desmond enlists the help of his friends: barmaid Bernadette Beattie , her solicitor brother Michael , their American lawyer friend Nick  and his old mentor, Thomas Connolly . Together, the group attempts to do what has never been done before - challenge a law before the Irish Supreme Court.
