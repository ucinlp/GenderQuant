The diners toast to the lyrics saluting the "douche bags" and applaud Griffin's performance. The dinner ends when the phoenix, horrified, screams in anguish at the revelation that the main dish is a large turkey, driving the guests away from the table. The beginning of "Hell of a Life", is played during this scene.  It then cuts to a scene of the phoenix sitting in Griffin's garden whilst a dark cloud overwhelms the sky; accompanied by "Blame Game". After the dinner, the couple is seen sitting outside under the stars <ref namehttp://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2010/09/fug_girls_kanye_west_puts_his.html|titleNY Mag|date2010-09-16}} She then tells him she must burst into flames to avoid this fate, and thus, return to her world. Griffin, however, cannot accept this and they make love to "Lost in the World" . He wakes up the next morning on his apartment roof, only to find the phoenix ascending into the sky, donning a gold breastplate. The film ends back in the forest scene from the beginning of the film.{{Cite web}}
