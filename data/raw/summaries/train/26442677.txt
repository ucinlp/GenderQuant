Sach, after eating too much candy develops a toothache which allows him to predict the future. Slip and Gabe come up with an idea to make money off of this and put him in a side show carnival. A mad scientist sees Sach's photo in the newspaper and reads about his ability and decides to visit the carnival. After seeing Sach in action he decides to kidnap him so he can transfer his brain into the brain of Atlas, a humanoid creature. The boys attempt to rescue Sach, but are captured themselves. Meanwhile Sach and Atlas have had their brains swapped temporarily and Louie has arrived in the hopes of rescuing all of them. He dons a knight's armor and temporarily outwits the scientists, but is eventually captured as well. However, the police, who Louie tried to alert earlier, arrive and arrest the scientists. Slip then tries to put Sach back on display at the carnival, but Sach says he no longer has a toothache...because he swallowed it!
