Voodoo Dawn was adapted from a pulp horror novel from John A. Russo, who was a screenwriter for both Night of the Living Dead and its remake. The story is set in the Deep South, where a diabolical, machete-wielding voodoo priest  is busily turning Haitian migrant farm workers into flesh-eating, zombie slaves. However, his plans are disrupted by the arrival of two college students searching for a missing colleague who turns out to have been one of the priest's earlier zombie experiments.
