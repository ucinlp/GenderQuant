The short film opens with Mater playing pranks on the other residents of Radiator Springs. This sequence culminates with Mater teasing Lightning as if he had seen "the Ghostlight," a Route 66 legend recounted to Pixar by Dean Walker of the Kansas Historic Route 66 Association.<ref nameRiverton man inspired 'Cars' character|authorJoplin Globe|datehttp://www.joplinglobe.com/local/x212017084/Riverton-man-inspired-Cars-character }} Sheriff admonishes him for mocking the urban legend, and then tells the tale of the Ghostlight. The rest of the gang say goodnight and turn off all the store lights, leaving a very nervous and scared Mater all alone in the dark. During the body of the short, mayhem ensues as Mater is pursued by the Ghostlight...ultimately revealed to be just a lantern affixed to Mater's towing cable by Lightning and Guido. The other residents of Radiator Springs watch as Mater drives around frantically with the "Ghost Light" on his tail, before Mater tires himself out and the cars tell him it was all a prank to pay him back for all his pranks he played on them. Sheriff gently tells Mater that the only thing to be scared of on Route 66 is "his imagination." Doc then jokes that all Mater really had to fear was "The Screaming Banshee" before they all leave Mater, all alone and frightened once again. In a post-credits scene, Mater actually sees The Screaming Banshee but, not realizing it's him, warns him of the Banshee and leaves the monster truck confused.
