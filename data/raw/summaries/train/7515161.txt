Russell Wong starred as Jian-Wa Chang, a musician who escaped from the People's Republic of China after being involved in a student demonstration against the government. He and his brother Wago escaped to the USA; he pursued his music while Wago became drawn to a life of organized crime. Wago and two US Federal Agents are killed; Jian-Wa is held responsible, but a Vietnamese mafioso known as "The General"  is behind the murders. Jian-Wa becomes a fugitive, using his wisdom, music, and martial arts skills to solve problems along the way, on his quest to bring "The General" to justice. As he helps others while traveling, he is aided by the spirit of his murdered brother Wago. In the series, Jian-Wa is constantly on the run from ruthless Federal Agent Dan Sandler , the direct superior to the agents killed in the two-hour films. Agent Judith Phillips  was a member of Sandler's team who was convinced that Jian-Wa was innocent and she gradually became his ally. This put her at great odds with Sandler. The series was canceled after the first thirteen episodes aired.
