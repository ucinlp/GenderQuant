The big high school dance in Santa Barbara is coming up. Judy Foster expects boyfriend "Oogie" Pringle to be her escort, but he declines. Oogie's sister, sophisticated senior Carol Pringle, has booked famous bandleader Xavier Cugat and his orchestra for the dance, meanwhile. Cugat's lady friend, Rosita Cochellas, is a dance instructor. She is secretly giving rumba lessons to Judy's dad, Melvin Foster, who wants to surprise his wife with a dance for their upcoming wedding anniversary. Soda shop owner Pop Scully introduces a disappointed Judy to his handsome nephew Stephen I. Andrews, who volunteers to take Judy to the dance, even though he's considerably older. Judy finds him dreamy, and having Stephen as her date definitely makes Oogie jealous. Stephen, however, falls for the beautiful Carol instead. This is annoying to Judy, as is her discovery that her dad is seeing Rosita behind her mother's back, presumably carrying on a romantic affair. Misunderstandings abound, including Rosita trying to explain the situation to her boyfriend, Cugat.
