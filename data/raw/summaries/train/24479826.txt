A strike at a sawmill in a small fictional community in New Brunswick puts Steph  and Piston  out of work. They want to resurrect their band Lost Tribe but Marie-Lou , Piston's ex-wife and the band's former lead singer, is not enthusiastic about the idea. Meanwhile, Steph is having relationship trouble with Rose , an older woman that he's been seeing and drifts first to Marie-Lou and then to Charles , who once left town but is now back.
