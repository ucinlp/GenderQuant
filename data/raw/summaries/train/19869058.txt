31 North 62 East tells the story of a British Prime Minister who gives up the position of an Special Air Service  unit in Afghanistan to ensure a UK Â£80 billion arms deal goes through, assuring his re-election. All soldiers in the SAS unit are thought to have died, until two months later, when one of them, a female captain, is found by Italian special forces and returns to the UK to investigate.
