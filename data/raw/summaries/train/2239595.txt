"Ben and Me" opens with two tour groups simultaneously visiting a statue of Benjamin Franklin. The human tour group discusses Franklin's life and achievements, while the leader of a mouse tour group reveals the contributions of a mouse, Amos, to Franklin's career. Narrated by Amos, through his memoirs, the mouse recalls how he first met and befriended Benjamin Franklin, eventually aiding in his publishing, inventions, and political career. Amongst Amos' contributions were making bifocals, inspiring him to build the Franklin stove, and encouraging him to print an event-oriented newspaper, the Pennsylvania Gazette. After Ben's experiments with electricity endanger Amos' life, Amos leaves Ben and moves back in with his family. Franklin is sent to England as part of a colonial attempt to reason with the king, but the mission is a failure. Franklin says, "The King was unreasonable. He wouldn't listen." Amos, seeing this—and the confusion and anger of the colonists—realises that he could help, but initially refuses. Amos and Franklin finally resolve their disagreements in the midst of the American Revolution, and Amos plays a key role aiding Thomas Jefferson with the drafting of the Declaration of Independence.
