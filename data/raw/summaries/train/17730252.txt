There are three hotel management students: Deepu , a calm and cool guy who is never able to express his true feelings; Kunjoonju , a swaggering Casanova who makes a pass at every girl he meets; and Ashtamoorthy , a playful, jolly fellow who flips over every second girl who crosses his path. They start living in a house owned by Kamala's  family, which includes her mother, Sophia  and sister Padma . Deepu and Kunjukunju both fall in love with Kamala but do not tell each other. Kamala has feelings for Kunjukunju. Later, Kunjukunju gets to know that Deepu likes her and tells Kamala that he was not serious about her and he is breaking up with her as he is bored of it. Kamala's mother is no more at that time and in some time Padma also dies in a freak accident. The bachelors' studies are over and they have to return to Kerala. They are upset that they have to leave Kamala alone. Kunjukunju asks Deepu to take her with him, but Deepu is adamant that he will not. Finally, Kunjukunju says that he is going to take her as he cannot leave her alone. At that point Deepu admits that he was aware of their relation and he was waiting for Kunjoonju to disclose that. They go back and take Kamala with them.
