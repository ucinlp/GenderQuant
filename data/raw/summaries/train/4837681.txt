Zimmy  and Tina  belong to middle-class families, live and study in Dubai and fall in love after initial indecisiveness. Zimmy becomes a famous singer thanks to Tina who appears in his first music video as a friendly-cum-romantic gesture. Seth Tahir Dawood  in Bangkok catches a glimpse of Tina on TV and asks his personal secretary, played by Kanwal, to arrange his meeting with her. The secretary is helped by Sweetie , Tina's brother - a drunkard and a gambler - who manages to convince her mother that the 40-something Seth is the perfect match for Tina. Zimmy returns from an outdoor shoot to learn of the marriage and heartbroken, vows never to get married. But unknown to him, he is admired by Haya , the daughter of Seth Dawood and Tina's step daughter. The film moves at an amazingly rapid pace in the latter half, but sadly in no particular direction. People die as if there is they have some kind of death wish and the abrupt conclusion confirms that the director, for reasons better known to him, was in a rush to wrap things up.
