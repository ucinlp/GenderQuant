Unbeknownst to her, Kevin suffers from PE - premature ejaculation, which is the reason for his divorce and lack of love. When he is set up with Hayaam, the over-educated shoe sales clerk, it seems like a match made in heaven, until Kevin's sexual problem stands in the way. With medical help, and patience from Hayaam, it looks like things could work out until Kevin discovers Hayaam can't bear children. Finally Kevin must decide if his own needs are more important than his family's if he's going to truly find love.
