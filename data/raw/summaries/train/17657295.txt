In 1954, brothers Chris  and Wayne Dixon , are on a two-week spree of cheap thrills throughout the South before their upcoming stint in the Air Force. Both Chicago transplants, Wayne applied for service when his brother Chris was given the option of military service or prison as the result of an earlier episode with the law. Driving through Louisiana, the brothers pick up hitchhiker Jenny Scott , a pretty blond with a shady backstory that she would rather not discuss. Meanwhile, local backwater town sheriff Reed Morgan  is preparing to bring back his son Luke  from military school - hunting season is tomorrow and he buys Luke a new shotgun. While Chris, Jenny, and Wayne cruise through the back roads of Louisiana, they have car trouble and they stall out in Sherriff Morgan's town. Unable to repair the car, they shake together enough money to get it patched up by garage owner Hamp . Waiting at the garage, they are informally threatened by Morgan, who points out that they could be picked up for vagrancy if they decided to stick around. Not interested in official trouble, the brothers and Jenny head out once their car is running. But another breakdown – this time nearby a fresh crime scene that includes a rape and murder by two men who are thought to have killed a cop – puts the trio into a lethal situation with Morgan, with a devastating finale for all.
