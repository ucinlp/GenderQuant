Mery per sempre is set in Malaspina, a juvenile detention centre in Palermo, Sicily, during the 1980s. The protagonist, Marco Terzi , is a teacher who has transferred to Palermo from Milan. He obtains a position as teacher inside the institution, and has great difficulty in establishing a rapport with the young, hostile students; in particular, Natale Sperandeo , the leader of the group, who is inside for murder, and Pietro Giancone . Terzi's situation is further complicated when Mario Libassi , a transvestite prostitute, nicknamed Mery, falls in love with him. With the passing of time, however, Terzi slowly gains the respect and admiration of his students, even from the most hardened of the young men. Mery per sempre was followed in 1990 with the sequel Ragazzi fuori, featuring most of the same cast and characters, with the exception of Placido and Amendola.
