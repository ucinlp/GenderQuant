Still mystified by his son's death, the father  of high-school student Gi-tae  tries to track down his two best friends, classmates Hee-joon  and Dong-yoon , to try to find an explanation. Through Gi-tae's classmate Jae-ho, the father meets Hee-joon, who says he cannot help as he moved schools "weeks before what happened to Gi-tae". Afterwards, Hee-joon berates Jae-ho for giving his phone number to Gi-tae's father but Jae-ho tells him that Gi-tae "went crazy" after he moved away. Hee-joon manages to trace Dong-yoon and urges him to contact Gi-tae's father and provide some answers. In parallel, flashbacks to the time gradually reveal what really happened, starting with Gi-tae's needling and bullying of Hee-joon and the latter's response.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}
