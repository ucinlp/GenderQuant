Mrs. Marva Munson , an elderly, God-fearing widow meets Professor Goldthwaite Higginson Dorr , who expresses his interest in the room she has to let and asks to use her basement for rehearsals of an early music ensemble he directs. She accepts the terms and agrees. The fellow musicians in the pretend ensemble are actually a gang of criminals, named Lump , The General , Garth Pancake , and Gawain . With all of their talents combined, the group of criminals plan to dig a tunnel through the crumbling, dried earth that has piled up in Mrs. Munson's basement and conclude that they will emerge in the vault of the casino. After a series of comical mishaps that threaten to derail their plan, they break through the wall of the vault and snatch the loot. Mrs. Munson subsequently finds out what her tenant has done, and outraged, she tells Dorr to return the money and go with her to church on Sunday or else she will call the police. The gang decides to murder her. Through another series of comical mishaps, all the criminals end up dying while trying to kill Mrs. Munson. Gawain is shot by Garth, Garth is strangled by The General, The General falls and breaks his neck, Lump accidentally shoots himself, and Dorr gets hanged by his coat after being hit with a statue head. The police refuse to believe her story about the robbery, and tell her to keep the money she found, which she gives to Bob Jones University.
