Wolfgang Weber is a bit unworldly archivist of the city of Castrop-Rauxel. He makes an astonishing discovery while receiving treatment at Thomas Vallomtharayil’s Ayurvedic clinic. 150 years earlier, another Thomas was at work where the clinic stands today: the Irish mining pioneer and Ruhr legend Thomas Mulvany. This film accompanies the archivist in a documentary style through his research into the astounding parallels between the lives of the two Thomas’, which leads Wolfgang Weber to a striking conclusion: Thomas Vallomtharayil is the reincarnation of Thomas Mulvany.
