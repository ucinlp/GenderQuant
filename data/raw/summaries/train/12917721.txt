Matt Colter is a white settler who weds Little Doe, a pregnant Indian woman. Ostracized by the white and Indian community, they are forced to leave and find a new home. For shelter they rebuild a burnt cabin, that unbeknownst to them, is on sacred Paiute burial ground. The Paiutes attack the couple, destroy the cabin, kill Little Doe after she gives birth in the ruins, and kidnap the infant. Determined to find his son, Colter seeks the help of his friend, mountain man Lum Witcher.
