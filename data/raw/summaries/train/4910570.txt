A movie studio executive  introduces the movie, explaining that the film itself has no plot, but simply shows Jerry Lewis as Stanley, the bellboy, getting in many ridiculous situations, bumbling his way from one scene to the next. Stanley does not speak, except at the very end of the movie. Lewis also appears in a speaking role playing himself escorted by a large entourage, as his bellhop counterpart simultaneously emerges from a crowded elevator.
