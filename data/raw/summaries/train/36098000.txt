Madly Bangalee is a Bengali rock band that inspires the film’s title. They rehearse in a dowdy garage of Kolkata, owned by Bobby , who owns Bobby’s Garage. Four young boys with stardust in their eyes practise their numbers not knowing what they are really aiming at. But the garage is under threat from a South Kolkata don Baburam . One morning, an elderly man, whose name has been shortened from the Bengali Sandip to the Americanised San , arrives from "America and Paris" with an imaginary cell-phone whose "SIM-card is not compatible to the Indian ambience." He is Bobby’s peg-sharing friend. He forces himself on the youngsters as manager of the band. But, San is a failure. As self-appointed manager of the band, he creates trouble between Pablo  and his girlfriend Tanya  coerced to turn main vocalist by San. She withdraws to fly away to London on her scholarship, cutting ties forever. Benji’s  girlfriend Joy  gets pregnant. Bobby escorts the couple to the nearest nursing home to do the needful. Baaji,  the drummer who is a Muslim had to drop out of school. He escapes from the trap of turning a terrorist like his older brother Sultan. He later becomes a police officer who bashes up everyone who tries to bribe him. Neon  plays the rhythm guitar but, sucked into the world of drugs, he disappears from the face of the earth with his guitar. Pablo, lead singer, bass guitarist and lyricist, leaves for the US and the group breaks up. Bobby dies, Baburam turns into a helpful ally and San ends up where he was - a failure.{{cite web}}
