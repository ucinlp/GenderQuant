This is a contemporary fable loosely based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment. Roseanne  is outwardly a perfect and popular teen, who suffers from a dysfunctional home life. Her mother  begins an affair with a local man ([[Jeffrey Wright  and leaves her to live alone with her alcoholic stepfather . One night during an alcohol-fueled rage, he rapes Roseanne. Traumatized, she decides to take things into her own hands. With the participation of her devoted and clueless boyfriend Jimmy  the twosome murder her stepfather in retribution, but Roseanne's conscience quickly begins to unravel afterwards. The story is narrated by one of Monica's classmates, Vincent , a boy who is as concerned with Roseanne's well-being as he is obsessed with her. As the plot develops he forges a relationship with her, consoling her and giving her advice while trying to point her toward redemption. In the end it becomes possible that he, perhaps, might be her only salvation.
