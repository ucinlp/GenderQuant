In an attempt to salvage their group's music career, Reggie Mendoza , a self-confessed lola's girl, and Mikki Tolentino , a man-hating tomboy and breadwinner of her family, discover Donnette Legaspi, a vainglorious, and spoiled rich girl, to be part of their musical trio, DoReMi. Despite their drastic differences in both their personalities and principles, their shared love for music allowed them to consider pursuing a music career in Japan, only to figure out in an interrogation at the local airport that a fly-by-night recruitment agency had falsified their documents and faked their passports. Due to this mishap, the girls travel to an unknown rural province, putting themselves in a self-imposed exile after the embarrassment they faced after chasing their dreams. While still considering the idea of becoming successful in the music industry, the girls help convert a small local restaurant into a mini bar where they can perform to sustain their daily needs and expenses. Their successful stint as vocal performers consistently draw huge crowds, and their popularity in the area attracted several record executives to sign them for a recording contract. On the day of the group's contract signing, both Donnette and Mikki back out from signing the record deal, leaving a disheartened Reggie as a solo act. As Reggie pursued a career as a successful solo singer, Donnette channeled her efforts to help orphans and other abused children in social welfare, and Mikki, started her own family, and food business with Toto , whom she met and fell in love with in the province. In a charitable gala where all three of them unknowingly participate in, the girls are brought together once more as they perform the song they co-wrote together.
