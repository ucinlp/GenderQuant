At the Bastøy prison for youths, the newest arrival, Erling "C19," becomes fast friends with Olav . Under the rule of Håkon, Erling comes to terms with the harsh winter, the mistreatment by the staff, and the hated Housefather Braaten. Later, Olav sees Braaten molesting "C5", Ivar, a timid, shy boy. When he raises this to the Governor, the boys are severely punished and C5 is reassigned far away from Braaten. However, while the rest of the boys are chopping wood, Ivar drowns himself in the freezing Norwegian waters. Braaten is apparently fired, to the overwhelming delight of the other boys. Olav is pardoned and is planning to depart, but, on the way to the departing boat, walks past Braaten, who had been sent away on a shopping trip until Olav, the only witness to Ivar's rape, was away from Bastøy. Olav and Erling attack Braaten and are locked in the freezing solitary area. They are freed by Bjern, one of the few Bastøy boys who has remained at the island as a caretaker. Olav again pursues Braaten, and the attack inspires a mass uprising. The boys ransack the prison, and drive away the staff. Braaten is repeatedly hung and beaten, and the barn he is in is set ablaze, but Erling drags him to safety. The army is brought in and violently put down the uprising. Olav and Erling manage to escape across a frozen fjord back to the mainland, but Erling falls through a gap in the ice close to shore and quickly freezes to death. Olav is shown later, older, as a member of a ship's crew, watching Bastøy pass by the side of his ship.
