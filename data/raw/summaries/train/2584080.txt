This version of the classical story "Little Red Riding Hood" is a sort of black comedy. The black-and-white scenario shows the forest of the tale and a narrator is the only speaking character. A wolf – clearly a man in disguise – tries to trick the girl. He successfully eats the grandmother, and then tries to eat the girl. However, the girl tricks him in turn and survives. She is clever enough not to need any huntsman. She does not "rescue" the eaten grandmother at all. In fact she eats her flesh as well, even after being warned by the cat. Combined with the teasing of the wolf after she escaped to make him follow her this short movie presents an image of "Little Red Riding Hood" that is mildly put: "not entirely innocent." As such the movie is clearly based on one of the earliest version of the Little Red Riding Hood fairytale, known as "The False Grandmother."
