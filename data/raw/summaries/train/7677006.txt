{{Expand section}} Bruce Pritchard is a 24-year-old working-class man and amateur soccer player with a passion for life. All this changes when he suddenly finds himself struck down by an incurable degenerative disease and confined for the rest of his life to a wheelchair. He makes a self-imposed exile to a church-run home for the disabled, believing that it is best for his immediate family to forget about him the way he is now, and his bitterness at his fate and his dislike of the rules and regulations of the place only serve to make him more withdrawn and angry at his enforced imprisonment. Then he gets to know a fellow patient, Jill Mathews, a 31-year-old woman from a wealthy family, also confined to a wheelchair through polio. Bruce begins to harbor romantic affections for Jill but before he can make his feelings known in a letter, she leaves the institution to return home and marry long-time fiancé Geoffrey. But Jill quickly realizes the relationship is half-hearted on Geoffrey's part, and after breaking off the engagement she returns to the institution. Gradually she is able to get through Bruce’s shell of cynicism and lack of respect for authority, bringing back life to his existence. In the process, the two begin to fall in love and admit their feelings for each other, consummating a relationship. But their sexual encounter is physically dangerous for Jill, who dies the day after the couple makes love for the first time.
