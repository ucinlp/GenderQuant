Jean, a wealthy French kid, moves into the neighborhood. Muggs and the rest of the East Side Kids are reluctant to have a kid like Jean in town. Jean's nanny moved Jean into the neighborhood so that he could learn to be a normal kid. She enlists Muggs and his pals to teach Jean American games, and eventually invite him onto their baseball team. Muggs is happy at first, but later decides to kick Jean off the team, as he appears to be showing off too much. Jean's nanny talks some sense into Muggs and the kids, telling them that Jean just wants to be like them.
