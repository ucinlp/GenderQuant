Various musical notes set up the sheet music to get ready for a performance of The Blue Danube Waltz. However, a sole note is missing. It turns out the note  is drunk upon staggering out of the sheet music to "Little Brown Jug", and the irritated composer chases after him to put him back in his place so the waltz can continue as planned. Throughout the chase, many objects are created from the simple musical notes, such as a dog, a slide, a clothes hanger, a lasso, and a horse, among others. Eventually, the rogue note is put back into place, but when the performance starts again, it has disappeared again, along with the rest of sheet. Turns out all the notes had gone into the "Little Brown Jug", whereas the high note had gone into "How Dry I Am" .
