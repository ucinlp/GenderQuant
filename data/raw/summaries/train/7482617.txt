The film is divided into three different 'family' portraits. The first two take place at roughly the same time.{{cite web}} In part one, restaurateur Mi-ra  is satisfied with her ordered, if solitary, life until her ex-con brother Hyung-chul  suddenly appears with his much older new wife Mu-shin  in tow. Mi-ra reluctantly allows them to stay a time with her at the family home, but friction builds over a short time and with the unexpected arrival of Mu-shin's young stepdaughter Chae-hyun, the three adults quickly reach a breaking point. Part two concerns a quick-tempered young woman Sun-kyung  and her relationship with her estranged mother . Sun-kyung's resentment toward her mother is exacerbated by an affair the latter is having with a married man . Sun-kyung diligently tries to find employment in Japan, but once her mother dies of cancer, she must care for her young half-brother Gyeong-suk and abandon her expatriation. Part three brings together the first two story lines with the relationship of Chae-hyun  and Gyeong-suk  some years later. Gyeong-suk, now a college student, is extremely jealous of Chae-hyun's openness to other men in her life and their compatibility is tested as a result of what he considers her "easy" behavior [her promiscuity is neither confirmed or denied]. The film ends with Gyeong-suk being accepted by Chae-hyun's adopted family from part one.
