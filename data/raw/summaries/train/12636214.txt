A wealthy man suspected of criminal connections is murdered in Daryll's office building and Tony suspects Deever knows something about it. She pursues him for information, a pursuit Daryll allows as he is romantically interested in Tony, and a "cat and mouse" game ensues. This convinces the real killers that Daryll does know vital information about the murder and they pursue the duo over this assumption.
