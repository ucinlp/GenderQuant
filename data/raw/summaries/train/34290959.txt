While making out on the beach, a couple is attacked by a knife and machete-wielding man dressed like a hippie. After beheading the man with the machete, the hippie slashes the woman to death with the knife, then sexually assaults her corpse. Charged with solving "the Lake Front Butcher" murders  are Sergeant Connor and Detective Haller, whose main suspect is the man who found the bodies, a retired army colonel named Peter Wayne. Routinely intruding upon the investigation is stubborn local reporter Susan Rather, the occasional lover of Assistant District Attorney Ralph Kennedy. Over the next two nights two more couples are butchered, one in their van, and the other in an abandoned factory. The modus operandi  is the same, and the theory that Wayne is the killer is strengthened when he goes into hiding. Shortly after another couple is killed  on the fourth night, Connor finds Wayne, who he had discovered had lived in at least two of the four cities where similar crimes  have occurred. However, due to a lack of solid evidence connecting him to any of the murders, Wayne  is let go. After Wayne's release, Connor and Haller are approached by Susan, who claims that Ralph is the Lake Front Butcher. Susan explains that she had earlier snuck into the station to look through the case files, and found out that the ex-boyfriend of the very first victim  was named Joseph Ralph Dwyer, which is Ralph's birth name. Searching for Ralph, the trio track him down to the abandoned factory, where he is killed in a shootout, though only after claiming the lives of another young couple, completing his pattern for the fifth time.
