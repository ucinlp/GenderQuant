Eli Wurman  is a Jewish publicist on the out, but all he knows is how to hustle and cajole, threaten and persuade. The hazy mania of his everyday life is fuelled by a steady stream of prescription drugs and alcohol. One night, Eli's last remaining "big client" Cary Launer  -- an actor considering a campaign for political office -- entreats Eli to take care of his latest publicity mess, a dangerous liaison with Jilli Hopper , a hard-shelled, quick-tongued television actress with a soft centre and a taste for illegal drugs. The actress takes Eli to a drug-and-sex den, a playground for the rich and famous, where she claims to be looking for a toy. Jilli is escorted off the premises by security. As she demands to know "Where is my toy?", she finds it and tells the guards, "I got all of you now." Eli is too stoned to understand the exchange. Eli takes her back to the hotel room, where he takes more pills and passes out right after witnessing what appears to be the actress's murder. In his opiate daze, he cannot be sure. By the next morning, the memory is buried. Eli needs to pull together a charity benefit. He also is tempted to leave New York for good with his former sister-in-law, Victoria. But his work is interrupted by the police who question him and by acquaintances trying to ascertain how much Eli has seen and recalls. Eli finally realizes he is involved in something politically dangerous, and powerful forces are at play to keep his mouth shut. As he strives to bring together the people he knows—members of the Black and Jewish communities, film stars and media—for the grand fundraiser, it becomes clear that dangerous forces are in play. But will the increasingly befuddled Eli be able to stay ahead of the game? Will he exploit the secret and continue his downward spiral into decadence or will he use the opportunity to change?
