Writer Leo Shepherd is informed that he has won the Nobel Prize. He lives in the Swiss countryside with his daughter, Virginie, who has given up her entire life for him, and he has an estranged son, Paul, who lives in the city. Leo makes his way to Sweden on a motorcycle, against the advice of his friends. Paul hears of his father having won the prize, and calls him to congratulate him, but his sister refuses to let Paul speak to their father. Still wishing to reconnect with his father, Paul sets off to find him. They first meet up at a petrol station, and later at the scene of an accident. Leo barely manages to survive. Taking advantage of the confusion, Paul kidnaps Leo, claiming that his father had not spent much time with him when he was growing up. Meanwhile, Leo's identification papers are found at the scene of the accident, and he is reported dead. Paul ties up Leo with yellow tape, and takes him on a road trip, giving Paul an opportunity to have his say and make Leo listen.
