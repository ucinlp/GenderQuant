She is sassy and without refinement, hitting anyone she disagrees with. Her "uncles" decide that the wild Bingo should move to New York City, learn proper deportment and enter society. While they are aboard the ocean liner, she meets the young, good-looking and well-educated charmer Andy McAllister ([[Robert Montgomery . It is love at first sight for Bingo and Andy, who sing a few songs. In New York, Andy continues seeing her.
