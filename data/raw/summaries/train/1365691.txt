Captain Josiah Newman runs the neuro-psychiatric ward of a military hospital located at the fictional Colfax Army Air Field in the Arizona desert in 1944. He often uses unconventional means and people to match, including his new orderly, Corporal Jackson Leibowitz. Among the patients in their ward is the suicidal Colonel Bliss, a highly decorated combat pilot and commander who eventually climbs atop the air base's water tower and jumps to his death, and a battle-scarred corporal named Tompkins who reveals under the spell of sodium pentothal the source of his distress. Newman also assists in the marital love life of Captain Winston while enjoying a flirtation or two with his own chief nurse, Lieutenant Corum.
