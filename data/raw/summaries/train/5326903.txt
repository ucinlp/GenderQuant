The Popular Front wins the French general elections of 1936. In Spain the Civil War begins. Meanwhile, in a Paris apartment, Fiodor Voronin, a retired general of the Tsarist army lives an apparently quiet life with his Greek wife Arsino√©. He is a deputy at the White Russian Military Union, and he is slated to replace the aging general Dobrinsky soon. Unbeknownst to his wife and colleagues, he is also a Soviet agent. When Dobrinsky disappears, Voronin is considered a suspect, and he vanishes without a trace. His wife is tried by the French Government and her reputation is ruined. During the German occupation of Paris, the Germans discover that it is likely that Voronin was murdered by the NKVD after having been smuggled from the Soviet Embassy to Red Spain. The film is based on the true story of White Russian general  Nikolai Skoblin and his involvement in the disappearance and murder of fellow White Russian general Evgenii Miller.
