Three hardcore criminals escape from a jail by overpowering the guards and snatching their guns. Once out in the street, they first snatch a car from a man passing that way, and then steal clothes from three other passers-by, and get themselves dressed in the same. Then they forcibly enter into a newspaper editor's house, taking him and his family hostage. After many incidents they finally get killed one-by-one.
