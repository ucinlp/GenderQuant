Peter Marshall , who works for the Trotter Poll , is sent out to find a missing co-worker, Hector Smedley. He goes to see the last family the man was supposed to interview, the nutty, gun-toting Fleagles. The matriarch of the clan, Mamie Fleagle Smithers Johnson , insists he pretend to be the boyfriend of jailed Bonnie Fleagle in order to gain the confidence of her dying grandmother . Grandma Fleagle has hidden $70,000 stolen by Bonnie and her now-executed father, but refuses to divulge where to her unwanted relations for a very good reason: she tells Pete that she has been poisoned by them. Before she dies, she teaches Pete a nonsensical song. The Fleagles are sure Grandma told Pete where the money is hidden and keep him captive. Then, a woman claiming to be Bonnie shows up, also looking for the loot. When she gets Pete alone for questioning, she reveals she is actually Claire Matthews . Her innocent father was maliciously implicated by Bonnie's father in the bank robbery. Pete wants to escape, now that they are alone, but Claire insists on staying. If she can retrieve the money, she can exonerate her father. The Fleagles try to poison Claire at dinner, but Pete accidentally discovers that all but one of their plates have been poisoned ; only the dish in front of Mamie's third husband, Mr. Johnson , is safe to eat. Johnson slips away, but is soon found glowing and dead. The uneasy situation is further complicated when the real Bonnie Fleagle  breaks out of prison and comes for her money. She makes Pete sing the song and understands the seemingly meaningless lyrics. Pete gets away, and deciphers the clues hidden in the words, from which Claire finds a key to the safety deposit box. Soon, all of the Fleagles, including Mr. Johnson , are chasing Pete and Claire through the various secret passageways of the house. Fortunately, the plucky pair are able to drop each of their pursuers into a hay baling machine, from which they emerge safely secured.
