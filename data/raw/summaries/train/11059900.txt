Carly Norris , 35, a book editor, moves into an exclusive New York residential building, not long after the previous tenant, Naomi Singer, falls to her death from her balcony. Soon she crosses paths with other tenants including the handsome Zeke . A habitual masturbator, who climaxes when showering, Carly goes to a workout gym with Zeke, who begins to turn her on by grabbing her hips while doing exercise. They embark on a passionate affair, after which she discovers Zeke's secret, that he is the owner of the building. Carly is also being romantically pursued by Jack , a novelist who is another resident of her building. Two of Carly's neighbors  die under suspicious circumstances. As she discovers more about Zeke and Jack, she begins to distrust both and also uncovers shocking secrets about other people who live around her. Carly eventually finds out that Jack killed Naomi due to his jealousy towards Zeke, whom she was dating. Zeke knew that Jack was the killer, but chose to ignore it, because it would expose his other secret -- that he has surveillance cameras allowing him to spy on every apartment, including hers.
