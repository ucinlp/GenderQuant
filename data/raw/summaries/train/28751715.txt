Rosalba  loves Danilo , a young man who is serving a long prison sentence. To ease his detention, she decides to write him a sweet letter every day. However it is not easy to translate her feelings into words, so she turns for help to Katia , her best friend, who now uses a wheelchair. Katia takes on the role of love promoter, just like Cyrano de Bergerac, but it soon becomes complicated, as little by little those emotions, those poetic lines conceived for Rosalba, become her own, and Danilo's passionate replies begin to belong to Katia. When Rosalba and Danilo break up, Katia sets out to meet him in prison, to see what the man she has fallen for actually looks like. Unfortunately, as she is not a relative, she can't obtain a permission to see him. However, her will is stronger than the rules.
