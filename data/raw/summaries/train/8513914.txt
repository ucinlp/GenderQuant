The story revolves around bad stand-up comedy performances by Jim Gaffigan, Michael Rispoli and Victor Varnado. The unlikely band of comics travel to a comedy and poultry festival in the country to exercise their art. Later, a follow-up gives a summary of how everyone has progressed since appearing at the festival, with differing levels of success. On the commercially released DVD , the outtakes section runs in tandem with the credits for around 5 minutes.
