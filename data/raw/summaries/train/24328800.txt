It is a romantic-drama/comedy film. Subhashree portrays an NRI girl living in London whose father  wants her to get married with an Indian lad. However, Subhasree's character is deeply involved in a yet-platonic relationship with a half-Brit boy Harry. Subhasree's brother  is involved in a relationship with a British girl and wants to marry her. However, his father refuses to let him marry the girl and this event promptly induces him to leave his parents' home. Meanwhile, Subhasree's father manages to bring his wife and daughter to India where he can find a suitable groom for his daughter. This is where they meet Dev, a quintessential charming Bengali lad who falls head-on in love with Subhasree and their marriage is invariably finalized since Dev's father is an old friend of Subhasree's Dad as well. However, although Subhasree evidently likes Dev, she hatches a plan to delay and finally, annul the engagement by implementing her brother's plan of bringing Dev to London and 'breaking up' with him abroad. Poran Jai Jolia Re is the story of how Dev manages to win his love over all adversities in a foreign land. Aritra Dutta Banik leaves his mark as Dev's cousin, making the viewers laugh at almost every syllable. Dev shows prowess in his acting skills while Subhasree appears to have honed her acting skills post the success of Challenge. Also impressive are Biswajit as Subhasree's father and Tota Roy Choudhury as Shubhasree's brother. The plot, which is a 'lift' from 2007 Hindi film Namastey London by Vipul Shah, has certain Bengali nuances added that make it feel Bengali. However, it remains a mystery why the director wants to pass off Malaysia as London. Perhaps he had taken his inspiration a bit seriously.
