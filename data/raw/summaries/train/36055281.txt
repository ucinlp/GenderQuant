Set in post-World War Two, stolen Uranium-238 goods are tracked by the US Government, using new radar technology; the girlfriend of a gang member is also recruited as an informant. Though the radar tracking device helps, in the end, it still takes an undercover girl to get back the looted shipment, from the criminal masterminds.
