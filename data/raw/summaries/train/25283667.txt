When a suitcase is thrown out of a car which is involved in a car chase and lands on the car of Sam Phelan , he initially curses his luck. But then he finds the suitcase is loaded with money. After bringing the money to his home, he convinces his wife Leslie , that they should use the money. Meanwhile Pyke Kubic  visits his twin brother Reese  in jail, who tells him that he threw a suitcase with about half a million dollars from his car, when he was being chased by the police. Pyke decides to go and find the money. After Pyke finds the Phelans, he asks for the money back. They return whatever money they have left after they bought a new car, furniture and other minor expenses. Pyke forces the Phelans to rob stores, in order to get him the amount of money the Phelans spent, which they do, reluctantly at first, but later with more of a taste for it. After robbing over ten stores in the course of a few days, they are still short on the money, and Sam proposes to rob a bank. There he changes the gun without bullets which Pyke gave him with that of the guards, and Leslie shoots Pyke in a struggle. Pyke's car and his corpse are sent to a junkyard, where a worker is bribed into destroying the car and the body. The Phelans again keep the money, but return all they stole, adding damages for people who got hurt in the course of the robberies. Unknown to them, Reese, the true owner of the cash, has been released from prison.
