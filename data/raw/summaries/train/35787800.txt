Shot on digital video and set on a apocalyptic-industrial landscape reminiscent of works like Eraserhead or Industrial Soundscape, it features a bug crawling over a house and falling on his back. Accompanied by trademark dark ambient music, the short film ends with a close-up of the door opening, showing a lighted room with some kind of machinery on it, as the ambient sounds suggest a buzzing light and mechanical work.
