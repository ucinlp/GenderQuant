A visionary doctor, Dr. Janos Rukh  invents a telescope that can look far out into space &mdash; into the Andromeda Galaxy &mdash; and pick up rays of light that will show the Earth's past. Looking at the past on a television-like screen, a group of assembled doctors as well as Dr. Rukh see a large meteor hit the earth thousands of years ago. Rukh convinces the doctors to go on an expedition to find the meteor that appeared to land in Africa. While in Africa, Rukh finds the meteor but is exposed to strong radiation  from the rock. Dr. Benet  takes a piece of the stone back to Europe and uses the meteorite to heal people, including curing the blind. Rukh, suffering from the radiation, glows at night when not treated and is slowly losing his mind. The situation is complicated by the romantic relationship between his wife, Diana  and Ronald Drake  - the nephew of Lady Arabella Stevens , who was part of the African expedition. Crazed with a desire for revenge, Rukh follows his enemies to Paris. There he fakes his own death, upon which Ronald and Diana marry. Rukh then uses the toxic radiation poisoning imparted to him by Radium X exposure to kill off the members of the expedition. He saves Ronald and Diana for last, but finds himself unable to kill his wife. Rukh's hesitation brings him close to the point where the radiation poisoning will become fatal to himself. He had been able to stave off the terminal stage by taking an antidote developed by Dr. Benet. But Rukh's mother smashes the antidote bottle and he bursts into flames.
