Geetanjali tells him that she's not worried about her impending death as everyone who lives in this world will be gone someday. She also tells him that she's not bothered about what happens in the future and she only lives for today. This teaches Prakash to take his own impending death in his stride and live life to the fullest. Prakash begins to fall in love with Geetanjali and pursues her. Thinking that this is also a part of his mischief, Geetanjali keeps putting him off. But one thing leads to another and soon, she too reciprocates his love.

Prakash reminds Geetanjali that everyone dies one day and so will he. He tells her that his death is no exception. But a devastated Geetanjali admits that his own life is more important to her than her own and she would not be able to see his death. She begs him to leave her and tells him that she doesn't want to see him again. That night, Geetanjali's health worsens and she is admitted in the hospital. After getting the news, Prakash rushes to the hospital to meet her but Geetanjali's father, who happens to be a doctor, requests him to leave as the same is the wish of Geetanjali herself. Prakash becomes sad and decides to leave the town. At the same time, Geetanjali undergoes an operation for her heart. Hours after her operation, Geetanjali slowly opens her eyes.
