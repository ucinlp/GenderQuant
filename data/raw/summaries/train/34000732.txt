The marriage of struggling Wiesbaden ballad singer, Willy Forster, and seamstress Therese is plagued with constant financial difficulties. After a heated argument Willy leaves Therese, unaware that she is pregnant by him. Thus, Therese becomes a single mother when Evie is born. She raises her daughter with the help of Willy's friend, Peter. Fifteen years later, Willy, who now has an international career as a singer under his stage name, 'Bill Perry', returns to Wiesbaden as part of a European tour. He goes straight to see Therese, who does not mention that they have a daughter. However, Evie is a big fan of Bill Perry and she gets to know him anyway. Therese confides in Evie the truth about her father, and the girl later tells Willy that she is his daughter. However, Willy's visit does not bring about the expected happy ending. Instead, Therese and Peter recognize that they are really meant for each other, and Willy comes to realize that his happiness does not lie with Therese, but rather with his longtime manager, Ellen. The film ends at Frankfurt Main airport with Peter, Therese and Evie there to see Willy and Ellen off. Willy promises his tearful daughter that heâ€™ll be back to see her the following year.
