The film takes us from the mouth to the source of the second largest river basin in the world, that of the Congo River . All along its 4371 km, we discover places that have seen the turbulent history of this country, while archives remind us of the mythological figures that created its destiny: explorers such as Livingstone and Stanley, the colonial kings LÃ©opold II and Baudouin I and leaders such as Lumumba, Mobutu and Kabila.
