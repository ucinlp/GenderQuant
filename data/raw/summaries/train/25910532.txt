On the way home they find a Bouvier des Flandres dog beaten and left on the side of the path for dead.

The wicked landlord is a vile man who is evil. Nello is an artist who rests his hopes on winning a famous art contest. As time passes and Nello grows older, the mill owner bans Nello from visiting his daughter, Nello's friend. Then, the evil landlord accidentally burns the mill to the ground and Nello is blamed. His grandfather dies shortly thereafter. People stop buying Nello's milk, and things turn bad for him. He is evicted by the landlord, and loses the art contest. Walking through the city streets, Nello finds the mill owner's wallet containing a vast sum of money. This is Christmas Day and he returns the wallet to the mill owner's house, and departs into a Christmas Day winter blizzard. He seeks shelter in a church where there is a view of a Reubens painting. He then has a dream of dying and that no one loves him. He decides that he wants to live his life after all. He is found by the mill owner and his daughter. His father is a very famous artist, Michael La Grande , who did not know Nello was his son but had been encouraging his artwork.
