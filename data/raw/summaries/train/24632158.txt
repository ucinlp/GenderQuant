Two Viking men are stranded in northeastern North America when their party of explorers loses a battle with Skraelings . The two men move northward, hoping to link up with an expedition led by Leif Ericson. They deal differently with the grim situation, one turning inward spiritually and the other reverting to a primal state, but both men are beset with memories of their earlier lives. Orn  remembers his wife , and Volnard  flashes back to his childhood home and his Christian sister  who committed suicide after Volnard killed the man who converted her to Christianity. Traveling, they encounter two Irish monks who have escaped from another Viking partyâ€”one monk  is murdered when he tries to convert the Vikings, and a makeshift Christian church is burned down. The other monk  joins the journey. The Viking men disagree about the monk and they separate. On his own, Orn meets a beautiful native Abenaki woman  who drugs and rapes him. Volnard bonds with the surviving Christian monk who washes his feet. An Abenaki man trails Volnard, intending to kill him. The two Vikings are reunited, but Orn kills the monk, the Abenaki man kills Volnard, and Orn builds a funeral pyre for his dead countryman. The strange cold land ultimately prevails over Orn.{{rotten-tomatoes}}
