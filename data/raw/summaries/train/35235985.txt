Buddy Gilbert  is a struggling musician living in NYC. He spends his days touring the northeast with his pet turtle, playing community centers, dive bars and coffee shops because, he says, it beats a 9-to-5. One day, Buddy overhears his neighbor Susan  get in a particularly bad argument with her boyfriend and, although he barely knows her, he finds himself taking her out for some cheer-me-up ice cream. When Buddy is leaving the following day for a tour, Susan asks if she can tag along, if for no other reason than to get out of the city a while. Hesitant at first, Buddy obliges, and finds himself spending a week traveling around with someone who, just days before, was no more than "the girl on the other side of the wall". From a rough biker bar to a 100-year-old birthday party and other odd stops along the way, record label rejections to family connections, Buddy and Susan make their way from NYC to Philadelphiaâ€™s Main Line, and they come to realize that it's not the road's end that matters, but rather the road itself.
