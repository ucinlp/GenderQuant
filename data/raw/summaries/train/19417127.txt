The film covers the lives of a family after their young daughter is severely injured in a car crash. It is based on a book written in 1998 by the journalist Robert Mawson as his second novel. The plot revolves around the controversial but highly humane treatment of the traffic accident victim who is in a deep coma and can only be brought back to consciousness with the help of her older brother and a gifted neurologist doctor whose work is not recognised by the community. The consequences of this lack of understanding nearly wreck the healing process."The Lazarus Child" author Robert Mawson, published 1998 by BCA
