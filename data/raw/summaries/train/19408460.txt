The gang's Eagles Club holds auditions for a performer to send to a local amateur radio talent contest with a $50 prize. Despite Alfalfa's repeated attempts to upstage his competition, Darla is elected to represent the club at the talent contest. However, when Darla does not turn up at the radio station, Spanky runs to look for her, while Alfalfa decides to take it upon himself and take Darla's place on the radio program. Alfalfa begins crooning "I'm in the Mood for Love". When the gang hears Alfalfa on the radio, they race to the nearest drugstore and rig the contest, calling in vote after vote for Alfalfa. Spanky turns up with Darla just as Alfalfa finishes his performance. As Spanky starts to berate Alfalfa for acting on his own, the emcee informs him that "he's won the prize". Suddenly, Spanky has nothing but confidence in Alfalfa's future singing efforts at which Alfalfa abruptly silences with a gong.
