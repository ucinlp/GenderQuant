The film continues the misadventures of two young executives, Larry Wilson  and Richard Parker , and their deceased boss, Bernie Lomax . In the first film, Larry and Richard were forced to create the illusion that Bernie was still alive in order to avoid being killed themselves. In the sequel, Larry and Richard plot to use Bernie to find the embezzled $2 million he had buried at the U.S. Virgin Islands. Before stuffing the body into a suitcase and heading for fortune, however, Bernie is partially revived in a botched voodoo ceremony and made to walk toward the hidden treasure whenever he hears music. Larry and Richard are also on the run from the mob, as well as two flunkies of the voodoo lady, and a representative from the insurance company sent to recover the embezzled $2 million, who usually ends up questioning his sanity whenever he sees a walking Bernie, convinced Bernie has died. Richard is administered poison by the "mobu", and must find the treasure by sundown to get the antidote. Larry befriends a lovely native girl named Claudia , whose father is a medical doctor who can cure Richard if he can get the blood of a virgin . The mobsters and voodoo lady are arrested, and Bernie is last seen leading the flunkies in a carnival parade, who have been transformed into goats by voodoo. Larry returns the $2 million to the insurance company, but not before learning Bernie actually stole $3 million. Larry and Richard use the remaining million to purchase a yacht with a crew of attractive women. After the credits roll, one last shot is seen of Bernie wearing numerous gold chains and riding a shark into the sunset.
