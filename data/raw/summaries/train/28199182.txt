The action takes place in the Yorkshire steel town of Rawborough &ndash; Rotherham was used for the extensive location filming &ndash; to which native son Johnny Mansell ([[George Baker  has fled after racking up large gambling debts in London. Johnny moves into a cramped flat with his brother Dave , a clerk in a local steel mill, and Dave's girlfriend Calico , a hostess in a local nightclub. There is an instant attraction between Calico and Johnny, and it becomes apparent that the relationship between Dave and Calico is rather one-sided. It transpires that in an attempt to keep hold of her, he has embezzled Â£300 from his employers which he has used to buy her clothes and various gifts. He now has one week to repay the money before the firm's auditors make their visit. Calico comes up with a plan for the brothers to rob the payroll at Dave's workplace to steal enough money to cover Dave's fraud and Johnny's debts. However at the arranged time Johnny is delayed in getting to the rendezvous, and Dave decides to go ahead with the robbery on his own. Johnny arrives at the mill just as Dave is leaving with thousands of pounds, but they are disturbed by the elderly night-watchman and there is a struggle in which Dave shoots and kills him. Initially the police can find no leads as to the perpetrators of the murder, but the night-watchman's son  is certain that the robbery was an inside job and his suspicions lead him to Dave when he tracks down a blind witness who heard the killing. The police enquiries finally lead them to Johnny, who is arrested and taken away for questioning. The night-watchman's son then confronts Dave with his evidence, not revealing that his witness is blind, and convinces him to confess his own guilt.
