A trip through 24 hours of the smallest capital in the world, TÃ³rshavn, the film begins with a father and a daughter who are having breakfast when some fire trucks drive by. A woman and her child are looking at the fire and meet a married couple. The couple say hello to a man who is going out with his boat etc. Out of this emerges a kaleidoscopic story of both daily occurrences and dramatic situations, which in an entertaining and ironic way acts as a commentary on the Faroese, foreigners in the islands, as well as Faroese society in general.
