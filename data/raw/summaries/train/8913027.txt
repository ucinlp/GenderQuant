The story is set in Kansas in 1910. Jacob Witting, a widowed farmer who is still saddened by the death of his wife during childbirth several years earlier, finds that the task of taking care of his farm and two children, Anna and Caleb, is too difficult to handle alone. He advertises in the newspaper for a mail-order bride. Sarah, from Maine, responds describing herself as "plain and tall", and travels out to become his wife. But she grows homesick: miles and miles of Kansas farmland prove no substitute for Maine's ocean vistas. When she leaves for a trip into town, the children wonder if she will come back.
