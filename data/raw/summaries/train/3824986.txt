Kwon, who starred as Hyun-soo, transfers to another school. He is sent to a bottom-rank class and experiences violence in classroom by a group of gangsters in his class, led by Jong-hoon, who is a stereotypical Korean bully in school. The teachers are also depicted as authoritarian to the students, using violence for the sake of discipline, as did most Korean teachers in the '70s. Hyun-soo, after a failed relationship with Eun-joo , decides that he will no longer put up with the conduct of Jong-hun and his boys as well as the harsh and violent disciplinary techniques being put up by the teachers, and so starts to train himself in Jeet Kune Do, inspired by his greatest hero Bruce Lee. His father, a master in Tae Kwon Do, frequently resorted to extreme violence to discipline his son. Hyun-soo challenges Jong-hoon to a duel one day when he is no longer able to put up with his irrational behaviour. Jong-hoon and his friends are grievously injured by Hyun-soo's nunchaku. Hyun-soo is expelled after this incident. Hyun-soo meets his friend Hamburger again at the GED institute and they talk about their past. He meets Eun-joo again, but they say their goodbyes on a bus. The film ends with Hamburger and Hyun-soo outside of a movie theater showing Jackie Chan's 1978 movie Drunken Master, rough-housing as they argue about Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee.
