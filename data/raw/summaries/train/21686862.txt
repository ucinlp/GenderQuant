The premise of the film is based on the statement that "White people often never see skin colour, but Black people always do". Through a chance encounter, two men meet through a mutual friend, Peter, who is arriving late for their meeting. John  is a white British liberal who would have a Black friend if he knew any and Dan  is a Black Briton who understands he lives in a White Society and needs to engage with it to succeed. After being introduced to both characters the film unfolds through the eyes of John and we see how cultural references and shared experiences impact on how he sees Dan's skin colour. Through a mundane conversation about work, girlfriends and friendships John gradually watches Dan's skin colour go from Idi Amin Black to almost white, as he discovers that they have a lot in common. By the end of the film John, doesn't even think about Dan's skin colour. In stark contrast, when the audience is shown the world through Dan's eyes, John is shown in Golliwog make-up, Blackface and frizzy wig speaking in what the makers of the film refer to as Wigger . Representing that Dan sees white men as constantly parodying his race and eternally racist. The objective of the film was to prompt an informed debate about race. The makers felt that any mention of race in the current political climate is festooned with political correctness and therefore unhelpful in dealing with the real issues that are impacting on the UK today. The implication that Black people were as racist, if not more so, than White people in Britain was designed to be the spark for serious debate around the UK.Breakfast Show, Colourful Radio,Thursday 26th March 2009, Interview with Paul Atherton about Colour Blind
