The film takes place prior to the September 11 attacks in 2001, and though based on the findings of the actual 9/11 Commission Report made after the attacks, the film fictionalises some elements of the report for the sake of artistic license. The film focuses on three main characters: Mike , Jack  and Valerie . All three characters work in unconnected jobs on behalf of the U.S. Government, and begin to receive disturbing reports and warnings that the United States could be the target for a terrorist attack. Their efforts to warn the government go unrecognised, and all three are threatened with dismissal for attempting to spread mass hysteria. At this time, the September 11 attacks are made against the World Trade Center, and it is suddenly realised that, had the trio been taken seriously, the attack could have been avoided.
