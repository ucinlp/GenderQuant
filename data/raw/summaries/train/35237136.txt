A suspended Munshi  of Kaude Shah, Mehnga Mall, also tried to get Banto and steals Kaude Shah's jewellery and reaches Rangpur. He gives the jewellery to Sunder for staying away from him and Banto. Sunder gives the jewellery to Bulaki to pay back his debt and so did the unconscious Bulaki. The truth comes out and Bulaki is charged for stealing jewellery. He told that the jewellery was given to him by Sunder and so Sunder is arrested. Finally, Mehnga Mall confesses and Bulaki and Sunder gets free. After a little protest Sunder's father, Kaude Shah, agrees for Sunder and Banto's marriage.
