Based on O.V.Vijayan's story of the same name,this is the story of Krishnan Unni and his wart.Krishnan unnni is a landlord living happily with his wife and son. He comes from a family that is well respected in the village. But things have changed now, labourers are no more the bonded slaves, who used to bend over for their landlords .Krishnan Unni still lives in the past glory days and refuses to change with time.The story takes a Kafkaish turn when a wart in his face takes a life of its own. What happens to Krishnan Unni forms the rest of the story. The wart is a Metaphor in the film. The wart is used to convey the burden of our old customs and traditions. Krishnan Unni, who is well rooted in the old traditional ways, refuses to change with the times. He refuses to get it operated, but tries to cure it with old way of herbal medicine. The lesson here is if you don't change with time, the old customs and blind faith will become a burden and if you keep on doing that, there will be a time when they will take over you, meaning all your decisions will be based on how traditionally you were doing it or what the old scriptures or astrological charts dictate you. After a while these old traditions and customs, will be taken out as something personal to an individual or a group and would be associated with god,it would be made into something holy. Now everybody has to do it as it is divine. Murali in the end shows how the wart which was growing in him escapes from Krishnan Unni and becomes a huge elephant. There are a bunch of priests who are looking at the elephant and they comment, such a big animal, we should keep it in the temple.The wart which was personal to one person has become divine and holy to everyone now. All he had to do to cure the WART was seeks the help of science.
