Robi  is a young Israeli who lives his grandparents and works at their store. He dreams of finding true love and becoming a movie director, both of which seem increasingly difficult. His film career stalls, until he can get financial backing and his love life seems to be in similar shape. While the urban city has places to cruise for sex, Robi struggles to find an organized gay community and a committed relationship. His grandparents tolerate his homosexuality, perfering to ignore the men he brings home and avoid asking why he regularly visit the park. Yet, they view his sexual orientation as being shameful not only to him, but to the entire family. When upset, his grandmother yells at him, and asks when he is going to find a nice woman, marry and start a family. His ex-girlfriend would love to get back together, but Robi has fallen in love with a man named Han, who caved into the social pressure and married a woman.
