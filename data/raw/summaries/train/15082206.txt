The exiled settler Alexander Ilyin persuades the goldmines owner Trifon Perfilyev to sponsor the expedition dedicated to the searches of "Sannikov Land", a legendary warm land behind the Polar circle. Hoping that this land could be filled with gold, Perfilyev agrees. Few more daredevils volunteer for the mission. The finally gathered crew consists of Ilyin himself, officer Evgeniy Krestovskiy, Perfilyev's survant Ignatiy, who is given a task of killing every other crew member in case they truly find any gold, and Gubin, a Katorga runaway and a former doctor. After a long journey they reach the volcanic land and meet the natives â€” a tribe of "Onkilon". However they soon find out that the volcano is cooling down quickly, and the legendary land is about to start to freeze so that every living creature on the island would be killed in process.
