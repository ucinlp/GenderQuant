Vincent Malivert is the head of a prestigious jewel broker’s firm on the exclusive Place Vendôme. Hampered by debt and implicated in trafficking of stolen jewels, he commits suicide, leaving his wife Marianne to pick up the pieces. Marianne, who has spent the last few years in a clinic recovering from alcoholism, discovers a set of perfect cut diamonds in her husband’s safe. She decides to use this opportunity to rebuild her life and sets about trying to find a buyer for the forgotten jewels. Unwittingly, she is drawn to a shady dealer named Battistelli, the very man who drove her into a disastrous and loveless marriage.
