Love Actually... Sucks! was inspired by real-life events, and opens with a dramatic wedding feast. It tells a variety of stories about love that has gone wrong: a brother and sister in an illicit relationship, a married painter who falls in love with his young male life model, a dance school teacher who is besotted with his senior student, and a lesbian couple, one of whom has role-play paranoia, and is caught in a complex love triangle. The film celebrates the belief that life is love.Love Actually Sucks Media Luna Biz Films Access date: 2011-09-16Love Actually Sucks - Scud's latest film censored Fridae Asia 2011-07-25 Access date: 2011-09-16
