In the year 2020, where global peace has prevailed, a sinister new threat to world stability is exposed with a genetically engineered virus that can stop the human aging process. Faced with potential worldwide anarchy when the masses clamor for the drug, Special Agent Lucy Chang, code name Phoenix, must go undercover to track the drug's illegal marketer who has conspired with a beauty products magnate to auction the virus' rights to international bidders and ensure worldwide chaos. Chang is publicly denounced as a fugitive by a traitor in her organization and is immediately sought by Jake Hawkins, a U.S. Marshal. Convincing Jake that a planet-wide destabilization threat exists if the virus is made public, the duo joins forces and, with the combination of her remarkable martial arts prowess and his high-tech weaponry, battle to expose the plot and destroy the virus supply.http://tv.yahoo.com/code-name-phoenix/show/6151/castcrew;_ylt=Ak2oHwHtLsWj_KTt2KGntWWSo9EF
