The film is set in the haunted streets of Hong Kong, with four loosely connected stories put together in one film. A group of youngsters go on a camping trip in the countryside, where Ken encounters a mysterious woman near a grave. His life is changed since then as he becomes a victim of ghost-meddling. As his friends return to Hong Kong without him, another sinister story begins. Mrs To has a date with her husband to celebrate their wedding anniversary, but he does not appear. The outcome of the second story leads to another story about Ken's friend Jojo having a romantic affair with a ghost. The fourth story is about Peter Butt visiting a haunted theatre with some of Ken's friends.
