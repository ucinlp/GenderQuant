 Publisher Larry Fellowes  believes the personal secretary/stenographer  spends more time with the busy executive  and makes more decisions than his wife,  which creates a stronger bond between secretary and boss than that between husband and wife. He persuades author Kate Halsey   to write a novel based on this premise with these points and promises of riches. When Larry's secretary  learns of his plans to marry Linda  , the secretary has a nervous breakdown because she is in love with him herself. A new secretary, Anne Murdock , is hired while Larry is on his honeymoon. She is attractive, intelligent and efficient. Larry, a workaholic, begins to neglect his wife working with his secretary, and they both fall in love. Meanwhile, his wife is seeing another man named Mr. Jameson  with whom she falls in love. Eventually, Larry kisses Anne while they are working together at his apartment, while Linda makes love with her young gigolo. Mr. Jameson gives her the key to his apartment and says goodnight. Linda returns to her husband  and tells Larry that they should go to bed as it is very late. Anne watches as Larry goes to the bedroom with his wife and closes the door behind him. She is heartbroken and decides she will give him her resignation in the morning. Linda decides to divorce Larry. Both discuss this in a very civil fashion. Meanwhile Anne agrees to marry her long-time admirer Ted O'Hara after giving her resignation. On the final day of work, Anne's sister Katherine Murdock  manages to phone Larry and explain the real state of things, bringing about a happy ending.
