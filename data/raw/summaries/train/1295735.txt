Henery Hawk  wants a chicken for dinner, saying that he is a chicken hawk. His mother refuses to give him chicken, insisting he eat a worm, or he will get no supper. Henery refuses, much to the worm's relief. Henery's mother puts him to bed and tells him to "go right to sleep". Henery sneaks out his house at bedtime, then goes to the chickenhouse and soon finds a rooster and his hen, Hazel, who has a panic reaction at the sound of the words "chicken hawk". The rooster chases him until his mother spots him and sends him home. He is again told to eat a worm and again refuses and says "I want chicken", at which point the worm gives him a big kiss on the cheek.
