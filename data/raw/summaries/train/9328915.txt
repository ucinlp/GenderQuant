Tom Merrick  works as a TV reporter when he's nearly killed in an accident while informing about a fire in the Evanston power plant. The sight of a creepy-looking man leaving the place accidentally saves his life, when he was meant to be killed with his crew. After some time, he decides to do some research on catastrophes for a documentary he's preparing when he accidentally stumbles upon several pictures of the man at the power plant , who appears to turn up in different disasters  as far apart as 50 years, but who still looks the same in all the pictures. He goes deeper into the mystery and ends up discovering that a futuristic enterprise --Thrill Seekers-- will make time travel possible in the future and will sell trips to the past. These trips consist of travellers going straight to a catastrophe right before it happens, so they can experience the emotion but are able to travel back in time again before they get killed. Thanks to that knowledge, Merrick is able to save a plane from crashing and killing hundreds of people. Unfortunately, this type of discovery endangers the very fabric of space-time and his own life, when Thrill Seekers sends a couple of agents to find and kill him.
