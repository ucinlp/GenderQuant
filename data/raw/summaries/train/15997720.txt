Diana Dixon, a Texan girl , wins a quiz show jackpot, and uses her winnings  for a trip to Italy. Her car breaks up near Siena where she meets Prince Piero di Montalcino , a handsome Italian nobleman. He believes that she must be rich, and she also thinks that he must be wealthy, but that's very far from the truth. The romance reaches its climax at the traditional Palio horse race where, after Diana breaks up with the prince upon hearing that he bribed the jockey of the rival contrada into throwing the race so that his horse could win, she fast-talks the rival horse's owner into letting her ride.
