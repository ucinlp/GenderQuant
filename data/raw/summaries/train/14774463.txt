An American boy and girl, spending six months in Kenya with their scientist parents, adopt a female cheetah they call Duma, only to realize that they must set her free so that she can learn to hunt and be free. However, when their pet is captured by poachers planning to race her against greyhounds, the two city kids, together with a young African goat herder they befriended, head off into the wild to rescue Duma.
