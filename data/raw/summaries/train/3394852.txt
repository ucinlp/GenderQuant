Nick Randall is a Los Angeles-based bounty hunter and an ex-CIA operative, who is asked by a former co-worker to help track down terrorist Malak Al Rahim. However, Malak Al Rahim is also looking for Randall, and Randall's employers tell him where to find him, resulting in the death of his best friend, Sgt. Danny Quintz, and his girlfriend Terry, eventually forcing a showdown on the waterfront. In the end Randall brings out Rahim handcuffed with a grenade jammed in his mouth. Randall explains to his bosses that they should send his payment to the family of Danny Quintz and he will just keep the extra bonus for bringing him in alive. As he starts to leave, he says, "Fuck the bonus" and pulls the grenade pin out.
