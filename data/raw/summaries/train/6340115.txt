Two sisters, 11-year-old Amanda  and 16-year-old Laurel , run away from several foster homes, sleeping wherever they can, including in model homes. But when Lo becomes pregnant, the two find that they can't make it through this crisis on their own. With nowhere else to turn, they decided to kidnap Elaine, a clerk at a baby supply store. But it seems that Elaine just may need Manny and Lo as much as they need her.
