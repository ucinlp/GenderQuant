Ifan , a farmer's son living in the Welsh hills, dreams of an academic career. His father  his mother and his wife, Gwen,  use nearly all of their money to pay for him to go to a University and are terrified that he may fail his exam, and it will all have been for nothing. As Ifan's father counts the money left for the umpteenth time, the postmistress  appears with startling news: Ifan has passed with flying colours. After the ceremony, Ifan introduces his friends, Emlyn  and Hywel  to his mother, father and lively grandfather . The boys eventually come to work on the farm. A party follows, and Ifan, Emlyn and Hywel sing a composition by Meredydd Evans himself  and call themselves Triawd y Buarth. Then the Grandfather gets up on the stage and begins dancing around like a lunatic singing with an incredible voice.
