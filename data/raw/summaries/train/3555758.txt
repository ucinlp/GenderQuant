A reclusive famous painter, Frenhofer , lives quietly with his wife and former model  in a rambling château in rural Languedoc-Roussillon. When a young artist visits him with his girlfriend, Marianne , Frenhofer is inspired to commence work once more on a painting he long ago abandoned—La Belle Noiseuse—using Marianne as his model. The film painstakingly explores Frenhofer's creative rebirth. It uses lengthy real-time takes of the artist's hand  working on paper and canvas.
