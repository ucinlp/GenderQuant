A doctor releases actress Georgia Hines from a rehab center, where she has been undergoing treatment for alcoholism. Georgia attempts to return to a somewhat normal life, but teenaged daughter Polly has moved in with her, close friends Jimmy and Toby come to her with a variety of problems, and ex-husband David Lowe wants her to star in a play he has written based on their married life. Georgia's increasing stress leads to a relapse, beginning with drinking in secret and ultimately resulting in her sitting at a bar, where she is picked up by a stranger who then beats her up. Polly's patience is at an end by the time Georgia realizes what she is about to lose.
