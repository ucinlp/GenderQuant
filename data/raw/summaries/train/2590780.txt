Doug Ireland is a concierge at the Bradbury, a luxurious hotel in New York City that is beginning to decline. Doug is very well-connected and is very good at his job, giving personal attention to guests like Mr. Wegman while occasionally pocketing a big tip. Doug's dream is to open his own hotel on Roosevelt Island. He has saved every cent and obtained an option on an old hotel. But he only has a few weeks to begin development and needs at least $3 million immediately. Doug's best chance is Christian Hanover, a somewhat unscrupulous billionaire. Hanover considers the proposal and asks Doug to "take care" of his mistress, Andy Hart, a perfume saleswoman. Doug pretends to date Andy so that she can get close to Hanover without his wife suspecting. Doug learns that Hanover is deceiving Andy about getting a divorce. But because his hotel proposal is urgent and Andy is old enough to make her own decisions, he doesn't intervene. However, as he and Andy spend time together, he develops feelings for her. Andy learns that a document Hanover has asked Doug to sign was intended to permit Hanover to take over the hotel project and force Doug out. He smugly tells Andy that the project had too much potential to share it with a mere concierge. Andy abandons him for Doug, who is chasing after her. In the end, after Doug and Andy marry, he gets a call from Mr. Wegman, who has been sent Doug's business plan by other members of the hotel staff  and has decided to put up the $3 million that Doug needs.
