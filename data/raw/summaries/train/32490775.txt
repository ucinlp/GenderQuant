Christina Perasso is a tough, resilient, 24-year old girl. She wakes up trapped in a room and has no idea where she is being held or who did this to her. She has been left access to her laptop. Through the use of an intermittent wifi signal, she reaches out to friends, family and the general, growing audience through social media. She lists facts, clues, pictures and videos to aid the audience in figuring out where she is, who her captor is, and why she was kidnapped.
