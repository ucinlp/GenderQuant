Set in a French Foreign Legion Camp circa 1954, the film follows the fantasies of a British Captain, desperately missing his home and wife. The captain is caught in a embarrassing situation caused by a combination of the monotonous, hot dreary surroundings, not grasping the workings of the Foreign Legion, and his smoldering desire created by his wife's lustful love letters, all of which is befuddled by his use of drugs.
