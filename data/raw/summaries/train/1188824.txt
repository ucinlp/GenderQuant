Surfer dude and occasional thief Jack Ryan takes a baseball bat to the head of the menacing Lou Harris, a foreman on a Hawaii construction site run by corrupt millionaire Ray Ritchie. The police and Ritchie's right-hand man, Bob Rogers Jr., all tell Jack they want him off the island as soon as he's out of jail. A local judge, Walter Crewes, has different ideas. He seems to take a liking to Jack and offers him a job as a handyman at a small resort of beachfront bungalows he owns. Ritchie has been cheating on his wife with a much younger mistress, the sexy Nancy Hayes, who catches Jack's eye. The judge warns him that she likes "the criminal type" and can't be trusted. Together they break into houses for fun and profit, then come up with a scheme to steal $200,000 from Ritchie. Harris and Rogers both come looking to get even with Jack. And it turns out that Nancy is not the only one he can't trust.
