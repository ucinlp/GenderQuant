"Subway Stories," structured similarly to films such as "Paris, Je t'aime" and "New York, I Love You," is divided according to director into short films, each with their own title, but strung almost seamlessly together. *"The Red Shoes" **Directed by Craig McKay, written by John Guare ***Starring Christine Lahti, Denis Leary, Kevin Corrigan, and N'Bushe Wright, this segment portrays an altercation between an angry homeless man in a wheelchair and the business woman who he manages to enrage by repeatedly running over her feet with his chair. As another woman becomes involved, things take an unexpected turn into moral quandary, and it becomes clear that the subway-car-bound court of public opinion can as easily convict as free you. *"Fern's Heart of Darkness" **Directed by Patricia Benoit, written by Angela Todd ***Starring Bonnie Hunt as the titular Fern, and with a non-speaking appearance by Mekhi Phifer, this short follows the conservatively dressed Fern, a visitor to the city who is attempting to take the subway, rather than a cab, to a friend's home. Falling victim not to crime, but to her own fears and assumptions about big city people, whether or not they appear different from herself, Fern refuses to ask for or accept help from anyone, and finds herself lost and locked underground overnight. *"Underground" **Directed by Lucas Platt, written by Albert Innaurato ***Starring Mercedes Ruehl as a sensual older woman with unusual appetites, this short asks and answers the question: what does a young man  dumped by his girlfriend and beat up by her ex-boyfriend  and his friends need to soothe his bruised face and ego? *"Sax Cantor Riff" **Written and directed by Julie Dash ***Starring Taral Hicks, and with a brief appearance by Sam Rockwell, this short celebrates the unexpected musical gifts which the subway can give. In overlapping duets between a saxophone player , accompanying first a gospel singer, and then a Jewish singer, one finds the subway to be an underground Carnegie Hall - whether the music is born of the grief wrought by experiencing the death of a parent in public, or produced by the heart-rending lament of a Hasidic man's  unexpected emotional outpouring. *"Manhattan Miracle" **Directed by Ted Demme, written by Joe Viola ***Gregory Hines, world renowned dancer, stars here as a compelling and expressive observer who cannot ignore a woman in trouble on the other platform. With a soundtrack of Vivaldi's Concerto for Cello in D Minor providing atmosphere, he watches with growing concern and fear as a distressed pregnant woman  across from him decides whether to commit suicide by jumping onto the tracks. His act of skipping a train to try to gain the woman's attention and keep her from jumping, reveals in part why this short is a worthy capstone to this finely rendered collection.
