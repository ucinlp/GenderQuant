Michael runs the house while Breck spends his time alone in his room, deformed and insane, conducting experiments to try to prove the soul is an organic object able to live outside the human body. Michael's fianc√©e arrives to marry him, much to the mother's dismay as she wants the family to end so the long history of madness can stop. Meanwhile strange things begin to happen at the plantation, such as voodoo, which is assumed to be the work of the local black neighbors, and murder.
