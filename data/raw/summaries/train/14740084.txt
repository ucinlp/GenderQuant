The Stooges are happily cleaning house, as they dream about getting married in a few hours. The usual antics occur as the boys make a near shambles of their home. For starters, Shemp decides to use the wooden handle of a loaded pistol as a hammer, which of course goes off, and parts Moe's sugarbowl haircut right down the middle. Then the trio try to reupholster a davenport, but end up clobbering Moe on several counts. First, they cut the upholstering with a scissor and end up trimming Moe's sportcoat. Then, to speed things up, they pour the upholstering tacks into a machine gun and aim at the davenport. The rapid fire release works well at first, but Larry and Shemp argue over who gets the next round, leading the rifle firing right at Moe's gluteus maximus. After Larry and Shemp quickly remove the tacks, Moe manages to swallow one. After all is said and done, the house is neat and clean. The Stooges then head their separate ways to marry their sweetheart â€” unaware they are all engaged to the same girl, Mabel . In rapid succession, Larry, Moe, and then Shemp appear at Mabel's home with engagement rings of varying sizes. When the boys discover their error, a nutty fight ensues. The three eventually, knock each other cold, and Mabel quickly scurries by them with three engagement rings.
