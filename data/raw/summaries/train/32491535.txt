Oswald is driving his uncovered car through the countryside. One day, he stops by a two-story house to pick up his date, a girl cat. When both are on board, they attempt to hit the road. To their surprise, the car breaks down. Oswald steps out to fix the vehicle while the girl cat impatiently waits. While Oswald is fixing it, a terrier comes by, wanting to play fetch. Every time the rabbit hurls a stick, the terrier comes back with a bigger one. This goes on until the terrier returns with a huge log, dropping it on the car's front as well as flattening Oswald underneath. Tired of playing games, Oswald kicks away the little mutt and resumes working on the car. In no time, the car was repaired and ready to go. Oswald and the girl cat finally set off. However, their journey was far from a smooth one because they had to dodge large rocks on the way which they did successfully. But troubles didn't end there as the two riders got a boulder rolling toward them from behind. Finding no way to escape, they run off a cliff where they plunged into a pond, splashing out all the water. In the dry pit which is what is left of the pond, the car was capsized. Oswald and his date were lying on the ground. The girl cat then stood up and expressed her disgust. Momentarily, a boy dog in a luxuriant car stops by. The boy dog invites the girl cat, who is most flattered, to come along. She then takes a seat and the luxuriant car then departs. Oswald is left behind, frustrated, and battering his own vehicle.
