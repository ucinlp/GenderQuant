The area was originally considered worthless and was fenced off and abandoned. The town was established around the turn of the century, with German settlers. It then boomed with the soldier settler policies after the first and second World Wars. Rainbow and its people have struggled to eke out an existence for more than three generations, with global economics and government policy compounding the difficulties of marginal farming. The film uses home movies from the 1940s.
