The pilot followed Tony Zutto, who while being one of the most sought-after wedding photographers in New York City, is also seemingly a lifelong playboy-bachelor, because of his family history. However, his lifestyle changes with the hiring of his new British assistant, Milla Cavendish. Also coming into the mix is Milla's roommate Gretchen, and Tony's photo lab technician Bruno. Tony also faces criticisms of his lifestyle from his minister-brother Peter, as well as from his father, bar-owner Danny.
