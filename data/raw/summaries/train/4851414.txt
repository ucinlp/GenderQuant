One of the twins is a bus conductor and the other is handicapped. The elder one, Shiva, overhears his parents' plot to kill his mildly retarded brother, Vishnu. He runs away to another city, with his adorable brother, and strives hard to look after Vishnu. As a result of an incident when 'dada' Sundara Moorthy, who runs a beggar trade beats Vishnu brutally, Vishnu becomes handicapped for life. Shiva leaves Vishnu in a home run by a social worker ([[Sujatha . During the day, Shiva works as a bus conductor, and at the same time, poses as the handicapped Vishnu: to play Robin Hood and steal from the rich and corrupt. A gang including Thangam , Ramesh Khanna and others assist him in these operations. He is never suspected, and so, with the stolen money, he takes care of not only Vishnu but also 800 people in other institutions for the physically handicapped. A college student Lavanya  falls in love with Shiva, but Shiva later comes to know that she is the sister-in-law of the 'dada' who handicapped Vishnu. Matters worsen when Sundara Moorthy becomes the chairman of the institute for the physically handicapped. How Shiva deals with the situation forms the rest of the story. Meanwhile Thangam is in love with Shiva, though he does not know this. Later she gives up her love and lets Lavanya marry Shiva.
