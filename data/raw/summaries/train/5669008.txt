After one book that ended up in the remainder bins, novelist Byron Tiller's inability to pay the bills strains relations with his wife. Desperate for any kind of income, he meets Luther Fox, an Englishman who runs an exclusive escort service called Elysian Fields, and is offered a job. Hiding his new employment from his wife, Byron's's first client, Andrea, is married to a much-older Pulitzer Prize-winning author whom Tiller greatly admires. Complications develop as he tries to separate a professional obligation to a client from a professional interest in her spouse.
