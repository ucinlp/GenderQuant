Peyton Farquhar, a Civil War civilian prisoner and spy, is about to be hanged from Owl Creek Bridge. As he is dropped, the rope breaks and he swims away, the soldier's bullets missing him. Avoiding capture, he arrives at his home and sees his wife and child. He runs toward his wife and she toward him. Just as they are about to fall into each other's arms, the scene cuts back to Farquhar being dropped from the platform and hanged on the bridge. The entire escape was a dream or hallucination that he experienced in the seconds before his death.  {{Infobox television episode}} Two years after its production, the film was screened on American TV as part of the fantasy/science fiction show The Twilight Zone. Producer William Froug saw the film and decided to buy the rights to broadcast it on American television. The transaction cost The Twilight Zone $25,000 &ndash; significantly less than the average of $65,000 they expended on producing their own episodes. However, Froug’s purchase allowed for the film to be aired only twice . Consequently, it is not included on The Twilight Zone’s syndication package . The episode's introduction is notable for Rod Serling breaking the fourth wall even more than usual, as he explains how the film was shot overseas and later picked up to air as part of The Twilight Zone. Marc Scott Zicree's The Twilight Zone Companion incorrectly states the French film was purchased for $10,000. This mistake has been reprinted in a number of books since the 1984 publication. The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic by Martin Grams correctly verifies the purchase price as $20,000 plus $5,000 additional costs for reediting. According to Zicree, An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge was the last episode of the classic Twilight Zone to be "produced" . It was not, however, the last episode of the series to be broadcast.
