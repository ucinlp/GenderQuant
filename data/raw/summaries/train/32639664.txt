That night Porky and Sylvester are relaxing camping in the desert. Sylvester suddenly hears a howl that scares him and Porky proceeds to point out it is a harmless coyote, forcing to go to sleep outside while Porky himself sleeps in his tent. Suddenly, an alien from the planet Jupiter arrives on Earth, with his mission being to collect some earthlings for an experiment. Sylvester is scared by the alien and tries to warn Porky, but this only makes Porky angry and causing him to boot Sylvester back outside. Eventually, Sylvester manages to show Porky of the alien who has arrived in their tent, but Porky mistakes the alien for a Navajo Native American and tells him to go back in his 'wigwum', on the supposed pretense he will look at his goods in the morning. Confused, the alien goes back to his flying saucer and drill into the rock to rise up from underneath the campsite and take it back to his home planet. After some more confusion and chaos as Sylvester freaks out and realizes they are leaving Earth, which Porky is completely unaware of and blissfully ignores, they eventually are released from the saucer's top as they leave the gravity field of Earth. Sylvester is utterly panicking and praying at this point, but fortunately they land on an alien world and safely wake up to leave, unaware that they are being observed by a pair of giant bird-like aliens who probably have a nasty surprise planned for them as the cartoon irises out.
