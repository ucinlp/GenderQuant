Too Much is Enough pays homage to Gilles Groulx , considered by many to be one of Quebec’s most important and original filmmakers. Tragically, Groulx’s career was cut short in 1981 after he was seriously injured in a car accident. From 1989 to 1994, Richard Brouillette met regularly with Groulx, recording the latter’s thoughts on his work and life. Too Much is Enough combines footage from these sessions, excerpts from Groulx’s films and interviews Groulx gave while at the peak of his career.
