The My Scene girls are attending high school in New York City when they find out there is a new action spy movie being filmed there, starring Lindsay Lohan and fictional character Ryan Ridley. While the girls, Barbie, Chelsea, Madison, Nolee, and Delancey, go to watch it being filmed, they get the idea to sneak into the film as extras. After a while the girls learn that being in a movie is hard work, they have to wait for hours before being called to the set, and Chelsea keeps getting horrible roles such as towel girl, and cleaning up after horses. The girls imagine themselves becoming best friends with Lindsay. When one of the actresses on the set breaks her ankle, Madison is called in to take her place. She plays the movie's villain, even though she has very few lines. After a while Madison starts to get a big head. She also thinks that she and Ryan are dating as they always go out together. When she gets invited to party with Ridley and Lindsay, her friends show up to surprise her. But Madison is very rude to them and pretends that she does not know them. She starts to act and dress like a diva, and avoid her lifelong friends. This causes her friends to become mad at her. Lindsay talks to Madison's friends after Madison gets dumped really harshly by Ryan Ridley and tells them how important friends are. Madison apologizes and her friends forgive her. In the end they are all invited to the red carpet opening of the movie.
