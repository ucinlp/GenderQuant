Betty runs for the office of President against Mr. Nobody. Both candidates state their platform through song and dance. In answer to various problems and political issues, Mr Nobody consistently promises that "Nobody" will solve the problem:  Who will make your taxes light?... Mr. Nobody! Who'll protect the voters' right?... Mr. Nobody! Should you come home some early dawn, See a new milkman is on: Who cares if your wife is gone?... Mr. Nobody  Betty&#39;s promises for improvements are shown, including door to door trolley stops, improved conditions for keeping the streets clean, and even a giant umbrella to protect the whole city from rain. Betty also promises to tame a split and incorrigible Congress made up of donkey Democrats and elephant Republicans, and offers a simple solution for prison reform: she will transform each hardened criminal into a limp-wristed sissy. Betty&#39;s campaign promises win the crowd over, and she is voted into the White House by a landslide. A large parade is held in the new President&#39;s honor, as she thanks one and all.
