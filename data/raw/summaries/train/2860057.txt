A wisecracking layabout, Jack Simpson  joins a lawn bowls club in order to be allowed to use a free parking space. When the club enters financial difficulty, Simpson is forced to play lawn bowls with the much older crowd, with hilarious consequences. The film's villain, 'Pokies King' Bernie Fowler, was played, in a successful change-of-pace, by satirist John Clarke. Crackerjack was the highest-grossing Australian film of the year and received two AFI Award nominations, for direction  and the screenplay . Location shots of the bowls club were filmed at the Carrum Bowling Club in the Melbourne suburb of Carrum.http://mordialloc-chelsea-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/crackerjack-design-award-in-seaford/ The Corowa Bowls Club in the NSW town of Corowa was also used for scenes featured in the finale. The music used in the climactic scene as the lawn bowl rolled down the green in slow motion is Zadok the Priest by Handel.
