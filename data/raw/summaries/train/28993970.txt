Daniel arrives in the Afro-Colombian community of La Barra on Colombia’s Pacific coast looking for a boat to leave the country. He intends to stay for only a few days, but a strange shortage of fish has affected La Barra and the fishermen have been sailing far out to sea in hopes of finding new resources. These circumstances make Daniel’s search more difficult. In the meantime the villagers have their own issues: Cerebro, the leader of the community, is trying to adjust to the advent of modernity.
