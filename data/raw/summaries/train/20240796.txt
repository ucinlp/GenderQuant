The film takes place in a Palestinian village ruled by an Israeli military governor. At the start of the film the village is under a curfew. The village mayor, muktar, wants to celebrate his son's wedding with the traditional elaborate ceremony despite the curfew. The Israeli military governor initially refuses, but finally allows the wedding to take place on the condition that he and his staff are invited.
