On her eightieth birthday, Adela prepares enough food to accommodate her children who all promised to be present during the occasion. She goes around the community and helps those who are in need. She tries to treat it like a normal dayâ€”doing her daily chores and duties but the widow can't hide her loneliness. Adela has three children: an OFW who works in Qatar; a drug addict son  who is currently in jail; and a daughter who works as a housemaid in Makati. They all fail to show up and greet her, prompting her to spend the day alone in Freedom Island, a bird sanctuary where mangroves are abundant.http://adelamovie.multiply.com/journal?&show_interstitial%2Fjournal
