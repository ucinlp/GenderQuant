Henry Creedlow is a man who has always tried to fit in society. He keeps his mouth shut, follows the rules, and does what he is supposed to do. But one morning, he wakes up to find his face is gone, and it has been replaced by a white featureless mask. All the years of acquiescence have cost him the one thing he can't replace: his identity; now he's a blank, outside as well as in, an anonymous, featureless phantom. Bent on exacting revenge on those who bullied him, he explodes, deciding that he isn't going to follow the rules anymore.
