Set in a remote desert location, government scientists perform reanimation experiments in an underground nuclear facility. The goal is to create a superhuman. Their first subject, "Thor," is a specimen from a suicide found in the desert. In the attempts to bring Thor back, an uncontrollable creature is unleashed. The movie begins with the family unit of Stockton , daughter Wendy , and son Scott , preparing for a visit to the desert. Stockton is a former participating scientist of the experiments. Upon arrival, Stockton finds the current scientists still continuing with their work. Thor is awakened, and the facility goes into lockdown status. Trapped inside as prey for their creation, the scientists and Stockton's family must defeat Thor or escape from an impenetrable post. As they are picked off by Thor's hunger for a chemical derived from human brains, their means of survival diminishes.  Thor is a result of science gone wrong. However, unlike the other mutants from the series, he was created through reanimation experiments performed on a suicide victim, rather than radiation exposure. Thor is a cannibal, though his hunger appears to derive from a necessity to ingest a certain chemical found in the human brain. Thor also deals with issues of parentage, reproduction, remnants from his former life, and his mentality that had driven him to suicide.
