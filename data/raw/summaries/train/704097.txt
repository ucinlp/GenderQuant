The action takes place in a massive movie theater built over Bugs' rabbit hole. Bugs decides to see what's inside. There he meets usher Elmer Fudd, and Daffy Duck as a freeloading movie goer, employing a library card to sneak in the back door. To many, the highlight is a techno parody with bubble gum and a parody of Friday the 13th . At the end, the Looney Tunes "That's All Folks!" sequence is interrupted by Daffy and Elmer, then Bugs, also doing this at the end of Baseball Bugs and Hare Tonic, comes in and delivers the closing line, "That's All Folks!". Bugs later reprised the gag at the end of Space Jam before Porky Pig and Daffy Duck came in.
