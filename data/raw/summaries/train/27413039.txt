The movie starts off with the newscast saying that a village's water is poisoned and drinking it can cause cancer or paralyze. These diseases are caused by the factory. Avatar  with Amrit  and her brother  go to the city to the minister who hails from the same village. They complain to the minister about their problem. The minister says he will help but later he ignores the matter because he makes so much money from the factory that the villagers' lives don't matter to him and he tells Avatar this. Avatar gets furious and attacks the minister but one of the minister's men hits him on the head making Avatar faint and then leave him on the train tracks to let him die. The minister is relived but at a public meeting Avatar appears in the crowd and threatens the minister. Later they make life miserable for the minister and then Avatar, Amrit, and her brother get together, and drag him to the village where he beats the minister and the factory gets closed. The film ends with the whole village celebrating.
