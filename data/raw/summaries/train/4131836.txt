The story follows John Belushi, shortly after his death from a drug overdose in March 1982, as he literally awakens in a morgue and is about to undergo an autopsy. Panicked, Belushi escapes and finds himself in the company of the enigmatic Angel Velasquez , a Puerto Rican cabbie who takes Belushi to significant moments in his life from the beginning of his career to the courtship of his wife, Judith , into his burgeoning comedy career, his friendship with Dan Aykroyd  and his eventual decline. The film alternates between Belushi as a ghost and his journey with Velasquez to flashbacks  as his career gains momentum. Meanwhile, journalist Bob Woodward  is researching Belushi's life as he prepares to write a book about the late comic actor. Woodward's investigation leads him to Cathy Smith , who procured drugs for Belushi, and the story climaxes with Woodward directly conversing with Belushi during the actor's dying moments.
