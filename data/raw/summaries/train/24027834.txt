{{Unreferenced section}} Poor Andy, all he wants to do is get to town and continue to woo his girl and ask her hand in marriage. Andrew "Andy" Hardy met his sweetheart Kay Wilson in college, but has since served in the military and is now being discharged. Getting back to Kay may be the hardest thing of them all to accomplish. He arrives in town alright, but things start to go awry from there. This was the next-to-last Andy Hardy film produced. The final installment, "Andy Hardy Comes Home", would be made 12 years later  in a failed attempt to revive the franchise. This film was also noteworthy for being the last to feature veteran character actor Lewis Stone as "Judge Hardy". Stone continued his career for the next seven years, making 10 more films until his death in 1953 at age 73.
