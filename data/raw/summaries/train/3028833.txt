In 1970, robber Ronnie Purnell is arrested after a robbery and jailed for more than 30 years. Since Purnell's wife was killed during the chase with the police, FBI Special Agent Darryl Kurtz took care of their son Aaron. When Ronnie is released from jail, he decides to take vengeance on Darryl. Aaron has also become a cop and doesn't want to hear about his father anymore, but Aaron's son Matthew is fascinated by his grandfather's past and decides to help him to find his old car, a 1969 Pontiac GTO Judge, in which he stashed a key for a safe containing evidence against Darryl.
