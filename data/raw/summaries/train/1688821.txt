In the early years of World War II, the Nazis have overrun the Netherlands and have taken over the shipyard co-owned and run by Jaap van Leyden . The yard was making submarines for the Dutch Navy. The German 'Protector' Von Schiffer  demands that they resume making submarines, but for the Nazis. By lowering food rations to starvation point, they induce some of the skilled workers to return to the yard. This leads to many problems for van Leyden and his wife  when everyone sees them as collaborators. But van Leyden works out a way to appear to do what the Nazis want but to keep his conscience clear as well. He undertakes a covert campaign of sabotage of his own work, leaving notes and graffiti signed under his nom de guerre Piet Hein . One submarine is taken over by the Dutch crew and sailed to England, which leads to greater security. Finally, van Leyden sabotages a submarine during its first sea trial. Thus killing himself and the many Nazi officials on board.
