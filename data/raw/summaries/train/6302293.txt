Old detective Myachikov is being retired by his boss Fedyaev. The official version is that Myachikov solved none crimes during last two months. But the real reason is: the Fedyaev's boss asks him to free the detective's vacancy for another man, Proskudin. Vorobyov, another retired old man suggests an idea: he decided to set up the biggest crime ever and to solve it together to stay at work. The first idea is to steal Rembrandt's picture from a museum. Old men doing this, but their plan fails: no one notices that the great canvas is stolen. Myachikov and Vorobyov are obliged to give the picture back. The next plan is to rob the Myachikov's neighbour, collector Anna Pavlovna and then to return the money, but do not catch the thief. When Myachikov gets the bag with money, he meets the real robber. He takes all the money, and next morning the honest detective is obliged to invest his own money to "solve" the crime.
