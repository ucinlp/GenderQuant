Stan and Ollie are prison escapees. In their haste to change into street clothes, they wind up wearing each other's pants. A cop chases them to a construction site, where they escape by riding an elevator to the top floor of a unfinished building. Atop the girders, 20 stories in the air, they finally switch trousers, contend with a crab that has found its way into Ollie's pants, and manage to nearly fall to their death a few dozen times.
