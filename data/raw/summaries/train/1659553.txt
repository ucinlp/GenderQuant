Roujin Z is set in Japan during the early 21st century. A group of scientists and hospital administrators, under the direction of the Ministry of Public Welfare, have developed the Z-001, a computerized hospital bed with robotic features.{{cite web}} The Z-001 takes complete care of the patient: it can dispense food and medicine, remove excretory waste, bathe and exercise the patient lying within its frame. The bed is driven by its own built-in nuclear power reactor &mdash; and in the event of an atomic meltdown, the bed  would become automatically sealed in concrete.<ref nameHolden, Stephen | dateRoujin Z  Film Review; A Gadget-Mad America, Through Japanese Eyes | url9A0CEFDA1239F936A35752C0A960958260 | publisher2011-06-22}} The first patient to be "volunteered" to test the bed is a dying widower named Kiyuro Takazawa. He is an invalid who is cared for by a young nursing student named Haruko. Although she objects to such treatment of elderly patients, Haruko begrudgingly seeks the aid of a group of computer hackers in the hospital's geriatric ward to create and install a vocal simulation of Takazawa's deceased wife in the Z-001. However, once Takazawa wishes to go to the beach, the Z-001 detaches itself from its moorings and escapes from the hospital with the man in its grasp.<ref nameTR | titlehttp://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/76973/roujin_z.html | publisher2011-06-22}} Haruko's fears are then justified, as it discovered that the bed is actually a government-designed, experimental weapons robot.
