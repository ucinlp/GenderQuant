The story centers on a rather uninhibited young woman named Eva  and her two boyfriends - Stefan  and Claus . Eva needs to decide which of the two is to be her "steady". While pondering that question, Eva inherits some overseas properties from a rich uncle. The three of them embark on a world tour to exotic places, meeting up with Eva's cousin Britta  along the way. At the film's conclusion, Eva's "choice" is to keep both young men as beaus.
