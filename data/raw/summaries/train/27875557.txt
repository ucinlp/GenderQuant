in April 1905 the fashionable Parisian women arrive at an abattoir to drink the blood of an ox as a way to cure anemia. Nearby a man named Mark, a thief, escapes from four other thieves. He is planning on heading to London with a bag of gold coins, but for the time being must take refuge in a mansion, looked after by two bisexual chambermaids, Elizabeth and Eva, who are awaiting the arrival of the Marchioness and her servants. The women are not at all scared believing Mark is taking them hostage, in fact, they find him attractive. Elizabeth gets jealous when Eva sleeps with Mark. The thieves wait outside to kill Mark, so Eva goes out to hand over the gold, but while two of them count, the woman takes Eva's dress and the man sleeps with her in the stables, so Eva kills them all. The Marchioness later arrives with her servants and they hold a party in which Mark is the only male, so he gets all the attention. When midnight comes, it is revealed that the women habitually lure people into the castle and drink their blood. Elizabeth helps Mark escape, so they hide out in the stables and the servants eat Eva alive. Mark confesses that he loves Elizabeth, whereas she admits that she never loved him and kills him. Elizabeth and the Marchioness go into the sunrise together.
