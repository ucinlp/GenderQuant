Little Cabbage is sold as a servant to work for the physician Yeung Nai-mou. Yeung is open towards the topic of sex, which is usually considered taboo in the conservative Chinese society at that time. He invents a type of condom to help people avoid contracting sexually transmitted diseases, but his idea was not accepted and he was scorned at. The lecherous Lau Hoi-sing, son of a local judge, has an adulterous affair with Yeung's wife, but they are discovered by Little Cabbage. Yeung's wife forces Little Cabbage to marry Gok Siu-dai to cover up the secret. However, Lau has been eyeing Little Cabbage for some time and he rapes her, but is discovered by Gok. Yeung's wife is afraid of being implicated, so she instigates Lau to murder Gok and frame Yeung and Little Cabbage for the deed. The pair are put on trial and subjected to tortures to force them to confess to the "crime".
