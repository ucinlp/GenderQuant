The film is about a pair of American authors who promise to find love for three single Londoners in just three days, as a publicity stunt for the UK launch of their book 'Are You Ready for Love?... How to Find Love in Three Days'. The fictitious authors Randy Bush  and Candy Connor  offer "a fail-safe guide to instant romance" to their dating victims, Melanie , Barry , and Luke ([[Ed Byrne . When Candy and Randy, celebrated Californian self-help gurus, come to London to launch their bestselling book ‘Are You Ready For Love? How To Find Love in Three Days’, they choose three single Brits for a publicity stunt to prove that their advice works. Luke, Barry and Melanie are the three unlucky-in-love hopefuls who pay good money to take part in Candy and Randy’s promotional promise. Luke, a self-confessed ‘Monster Lover’, is a 38 year old ageing pop star who relies on his status as a one hit wonder to attract one night stands. He is in desperate need of help to find a real relationship. Barry, a 35 year old Jewish dentist is a perfectionist with high expectations for his perfect partner. He turns to Candy and Randy in a last attempt to avoid his domineering mother’s match-making scheme. Melanie, a 32 year old photographer, is a hopeless romantic looking for ‘The One’. Always seeming to find the wrong one, she believes that Candy and Randy will help her to find true love. These three single Brits have 72 hours to find love by following the advice given to them by the love gurus and their new book. Throughout this three day period, their every move is filmed by roving cameras who are documenting their success for a promotional TV programme to be shown at a press conference after the three days are up. Are You Ready for Love? is released on DVD by Sony on 9 February 2009 and is already available to pre-order on the internet.
