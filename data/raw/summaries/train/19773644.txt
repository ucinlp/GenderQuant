The gang  offers to help their pal Waldo attract customers to his lemonade stand. Redecorating their clubhouse as a lavish nightclub, the kids stage an elaborate floor show, with Darla Hood as the star vocalist. Unfortunately, their efforts attract only one patronâ€”a surly, stone-faced little kid .<ref namehttp://movies.nytimes.com/movie/226202/Waldo's-Last-Stand/overview |title2008-10-08|work=NY Times}} Spanky and the other kids try to persuade Froggy into buying a drink, even going as far as singing an impromptu song about dryness and thirst, but to no avail. The kids then come up with an idea: to put a heater under Froggy which would heat him up and force him to buy a drink. When the floor show ends, Spanky asks Froggy why he wouldn't buy a drink and the latter responds, with a Popeye-the-Sailor voice, that he doesn't have any money and that it's to hot in the clubhouse; he then leaves. Spanky then realizes that the reason Waldo had no customers  was because they were all in the floor show. The entire gang, including Waldo and a donkey, laughs as the short ends.
