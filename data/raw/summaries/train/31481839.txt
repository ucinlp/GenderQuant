The film tells the story Unniyarcha, the valiant heroine of the Vadakkanpattu, though a member of the fairer sex, masters martial arts and proves herself as an equal to her brother Aromal Chekavar and cousin Chandu Chekavar, both renowned warriors. Unniyarcha is portrayed as the embodiment of all virtues. The film also narrates how jealousy takes its roots in the mind of Chandu, and how he grows hostile to Aaromal, consequently betraying him during a duel. Unniyarcha then pledges to take revenge for this betrayal. This forms the crux of the film.
