A trio of Mafia gangsters&nbsp;– The Prince , Cameo  and Twenty Years ([[Mickey Knox —are hiding in a warehouse. They have surrounded themselves with guns and liquor, and they kill time by joking and bickering with scatological language. But as their isolation from the world progresses, their drinking and arguing intensifies. They are briefly visited by a man with a barking dog—the canine is silenced when The Prince outbarks him—and by two women, one of whom gives The Prince a knife for committing suicide. The police arrive at the warehouse and the gangsters are taken away.<ref namehttp://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,837699,00.html|titleTime Magazine|date=January 12, 1968}}
