Runnicles, a clerk at a small-town British bank http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070450/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFxYeeYPrsY, is horrified when a package arrives containing pornography rather than the new calculator he expected. His efforts to dispose of it, while avoiding detection, turn into a farcical series of events including a bank inspector, the police and a local criminal to whom the pornography actually belongs.
