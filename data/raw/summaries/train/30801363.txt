Clark Kent and Lois Lane exit the Daily Planet building with Lois asking Clark why he always runs to the bathroom whenever a big story breaks. He explains to her that his bladder goes out of control whenever he gets nervous. Suddenly, a giant robot appears from out of nowhere and attacks Metropolis. Clark quickly disappears into a nearby phone booth and changes into Superman to combat the robotic threat. After a brief battle, Superman throws the robot into the air, only to see armies of dozens of robots flying in the sky.
