Farina and Stymie are orphans and staying in a small flat near a black community church. The authorities want to put Stymie into an orphanage. Farina is sad about this but attempts to have a goodbye for Stymie with help from the gang. As Farina gets the food set up, Stymie eats it quicker than the gang could arrive. As the gang arrives, a man from the orphanage arrives to take Stymie to the home. The gang then attacks him in order to stop him from taking Stymie away. Miss Crabtree, their teacher, arrives on the scene and presumably settles matters.
