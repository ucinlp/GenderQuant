An American-raised Indian, Krishnagopal Reddy  finds out to his dismay that his Princeton University roommates are all Indian. He does not associate with the Indian culture that his parents and family have pushed upon him and prefers to be as American as possible. His roommates include Ajay , a Punjabi idolizing desi; Jagjit, who loves art but studies engineering to please his father; and Salim, who is very traditional and conservative, feeling that Indian-American girls are too Westernized to make good wives. Kris meets Nina, a girl he immediately falls for, and is surprised to find out that not only is she Indian, but she is also quite involved with Indian culture. The movie revolves around him making mistakes and trying his best to win Nina over, from joining the Indian Students Association to be near her, to learning how to perform a Dandiya Raas. Thus, Kris eventually begins to enjoy the company of his roommates, all of whom put together their knowledge and skill to help Kris impress Nina through various ways involving the Indian culture, which he eventually comes to love as well. The night of the show, the four roommates show up. There is a fight scene at the end between Nina's friend Rakesh and Kris, and Kris wins.  Jagjit's father sees what impressive statues he has made for the function and is proud of his son. Salim eventually finds a girl  that he likes. Though Ajay doesn't get rid of his "African-American roots," it is implied that he has found a new friend in the president of the Indian Association. The Dandiya Raas and the whole Indian Association function goes off without a hitch.
