The film opens in with a title sequence showing a radar screen with air traffic controllers talking in the background. American Airlines Flight 117 appears on the radar screen, and the air traffic controllers instruct the aircraft to make an emergency landing at LAX. The flight responds by saying that it is unable to maintain altitude, and begins an emergency descent. Now we see a young man driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee down a mysteriously empty stretch of the 405 freeway. Soon thereafter the aforementioned DC-10 airliner makes an emergency landing onto the same road. The plane's nose gear collides with the Jeep and collapses, dropping the fuselage onto the Jeep's roof and pushing the Jeep to a much higher speed until both vehicles finally stop. In the process of slowing down, the plane and the man's car narrowly miss an elderly woman driving slowly in her car, though she is oblivious to this fact and extends the middle finger as she cruises past. The film ends with police cars, ambulances, fire engines and other emergency vehicles along with hovering news and police helicopters surrounding the scene.
