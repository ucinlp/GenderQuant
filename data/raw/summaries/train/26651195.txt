An elevator operator  in a luxury hotel courts the hotel president's daughter . She is engaged to another, but when her fiance leaves on a business trip, Harry asks her to join him for dinner. During dinner, Harry is introduced to her father, who misinterprets Harry's remarks about elevators as being a tip to invest in the Ups and Downs Elevator Company. June's fiance returns and breaks off the engagement, thinking that his prospective father-in-law has lost everything on a worthless stock. But the investment turns out to be wildly profitable, Harry and June are engaged, and the film ends with them tap-dancing away in a production number dominated by a giant stock ticker machine.
