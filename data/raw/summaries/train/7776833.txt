Donald enters as a hobo, walking through the woods, when he spies some food sitting in the window of a cabin. He tries to help himself to some, not knowing that Peg-Leg Pete is trying to enjoy lunch. Pete is angered when Donald steals food right from under his nose, and lights a stick of dynamite, which Donald takes, thinking it a sausage. After the explosion, Pete  drags Donald into the woods and tells him that he will have to work for him as a lumberjack for food. Donald is rather incompetent at logging activities, causing a heavy branch to fall on Pete, and running a saw through Pete's clothing. The last straw comes when he chops down a tree that lands on Pete. Pete roars like a lion with anger. Pete furiously starts chasing Donald to some nearby railroad tracks, where they both jump on handcars and begin a lengthy chase. Pete tries to stab Donald with a harpoon-like spear, but only manages to dismantle Donald's handcar piece by piece. Eventually Donald is only running along the tracks, but he manages to largely destroy Pete's by dumping a load of coal from an overhead chute down on his. Pete is then left just riding one wheel on his car like a unicycle. Donald then comes to a railroad switch and pulls it, causing Pete to crash into a row of boxcars. Relieved, Donald wanders off again.
