The film stars Bryant “HairKutt” Johnson, director Elliott, Maurice Bradley, and Anthony Dorsey as four friends from St. Louis, Missouri, who travel to a remote cabin in the Smokey Mountains of Tennessee. Their plan is to spend a week together to help Hairkutt kick his 15-year addiction to heroin. Hairkutt longs to kick his heroin addiction in order to finally care for his daughter and to realize his dream of running his own hair-cutting business. His friends, particularly Curtis Elliott, want to help him, so they travel to a cabin in Tennessee, cover its carpeting with plastic sheeting, and prepare restraining ropes on one of the beds. Hairkutt will attempt to kick the habit cold turkey. It is stated that 99% of attempts to quite heroin cold turkey are unsuccessful. The first night unfolds, and the tough love of Hairkutt's friends quickly reaches new depths. He writhes in agony, night after night, and as his friends care for him and joust with him verbally, the question is whether this will be Hairkutt's deathbed or a springboard to a new life.
