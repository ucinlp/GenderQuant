Dangerous Parking tells the story of Noah Arkwright, a cult director in the indie film world, whose life is dominated by alcohol, drugs, and casual sex. Alcoholism and drug addiction have him firmly in their grasp - but Noah has no interest in acknowledging either until Kirstin, a reformed alcoholic, convinces him that he is heading for destruction and sets him on the path to reclaim himself. With the help of his best friend Ray and his new girlfriend Claire, Noah attempts to get his life back together. And that is when Mother Nature deals him the cruelest blow of all. Peter Howitt adapted the novel into a screenplay and directed the film, which he produced with Richard Johns. Principal photography was completed on November 16, 2006; the film was completed in May 2007.
