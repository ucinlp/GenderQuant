The Cartoon opens with a note from the director: :For no particular reason, this story is set in the stone age, millions and billions and trillions of years ago, probably before some of you were even born. Casper  and Fido  go duck hunting and find Daffy. Casper slingshots a rock at Daffy, but Daffy manages to avoid it by disguising himself as a traffic cop. When the rock realizes that it has been tricked, it backtracks towards Daffy but ends up hitting Fido. Fido proceeds to perform a dazed dance. Daffy snatches Casper's slingshot and tricks Casper into thinking that swimming is not allowed . Subsequently, Casper and Fido leave, but Daffy, knowing that Casper won't give up, paints himself on a nearby stone. Casper, holding a stone club, sees the painting and bashes it, but the force backfires and makes Casper dizzy. Daffy gives Casper a glass of water, which cures the dizziness and earns him Casper's trust. Daffy, however, gives Casper a card advertising a rare, gigantic duck living nearby, which Casper and Fido begin to hunt, following signs planted by Daffy. They eventually reach the duck , terrifying Casper until Daffy gives Casper a knife with which to stab the duck. Daffy runs away, and Casper does so, and the ensuing explosion kills Casper and Fido and destroys the whole place, but it doesn't kill Daffy. The short ends showing Casper and Fido in the wrong version of Heaven, sitting on clouds, Fido plays a lyre while Daffy  and Casper  lament their mistakes .
