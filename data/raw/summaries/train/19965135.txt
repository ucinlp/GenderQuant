Radio therapist Amanda Grace's life turns hellish after she becomes involved with young hustler Mick Burroughs. Mick seduces the radio host in order to get hold of a file she has on a criminal who also happens to be one of her patients. Soon the two are having steamy, erotic encounters that include kinky sex. But she gets so caught up in their relationship that she leaves herself wide open to Mick's treachery. Amanda finds her entire career in jeopardy when Mick blackmails her, and threatens to show everyone an incriminating videotape of them having sex, which also involved a female prostitute, if she doesn't do whatever he says.{{rotten-tomatoes}}
