She overlooks Ravi's brutal past life during when he had murdered many including Sengudi , who was with him right from the childhood days. She loves him but he appears quite satisfied by using her whenever he's driven by his sexual urge. Believing that she could change him for the better Kani marries him after his return from the prison after a jail term. Ravi looks like a changed man after emerging from jail and tells his wife that the talks he had with some religious persons made him a complete man. However his real self comes out when he hears about Kani’s good-looking patient Amudhanila ([[Anjali  and her 'inability' to give birth to a child. Ravi's evil mind springs back to life as his urge to have sex with Amudha increases. He gets close to her pretending to be the doctor’s assistant. Ravi almost succeeds in making Amudha believe that he had the 'solution' to ‘cure’ her problem. How Amudha is saved and how Kani treats her sex-maniac husband is what the script is all about.
