Coined one of the most intimate and obstinate filmmakers in Belgium, Boris Lehman acts in, directs, produces, and distributes his films, single-handedly incarnating the essence of a creator who manages to survive on the fringes of his industry. From Brussels to Paris, friends, filmmakers, critics, and crew offer their understanding of a man for whom life is a reason to film, and film, a reason to live.
