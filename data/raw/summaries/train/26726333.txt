The story follows two out of work actors, Mel and Fred. Mel works part time as a day laborer. They learn that screenwriter Fritz Frobisher, who had violently abused the two actors with a whip during a childhood acting job, will be appearing at a screening of one of his films that will take place in Monument Valley. The two decide to travel from Los Angeles to the screening, but neither owns a car, so they convince Mel's daughter, Delilah, to drive them on their revenge journey.
