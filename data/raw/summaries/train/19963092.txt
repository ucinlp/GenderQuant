It is a comedy about two misfit men, Sal  and his friend Charlie , who are cheated out of $10,000 that they had borrowed from a Mafia kingpin. They must flee from New York to Los Angeles, only to there get involved in a caper involving a video of Senators in compromising positions. Given a cool million for the video, they are then pursued by the mob and the FBI. This brings about a surprise ending to the film, as well as to their bungling adventures.
