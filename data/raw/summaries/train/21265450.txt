Mathematician Teresa just wanted to study during the College spring break. But her friends, who wanted her to live a little, dragged her out to parties. The next thing she knows, she has been drugged, kidnapped, made a redhead, tattooed, and is wearing leather! It's the old switcheroo in this action comedy that follows the exploits of desperate extortionists. Gloria is a fluffhead with a Chinese dragon tattooed upon her chest. She wears lovely holograph earrings that just happen to contain classified detail of the U.S. space program. She is taken hostage by the bumbling extortionists and their leader Carl, former head of a freezer treat company. Unfortunately for them, Gloria accidentally drowns in their pool when she tangles with a beach ball. Now the crooks must find a look-a-like for Gloria. They find her in Teresa, a college girl with a talent for mathematics. She is captured and tattooed. She soon escapes leading the crooks on a merry chase. Joining in the hunt for Teresa is an FBI agent and her new boyfriend.Brian W Martz http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111397/http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll
