The short involves a character named André being awakened in a forest by a pesky bee named Wally B. André distracts the bee so that he can run away. Wally B. chases André and eventually catches up with him then stings him off the screen. Wally B. later reappears with a bent stinger. Soon though, Wally B. gets hit by André's tossed hat as a last laugh.
