{{Plot|datePrologueThursdayMondaySaturdayTuesdayFridaySundayWednesdayEpilogue The movie ends with Linda back home asleep on a mattress with no sheets, her daughters run in and tell her that the moving truck has arrived. Linda kisses her daughters and comments with a smile that her daughter's scars from the accident are healing well. The girls then leave the room and do not close the door. Linda moves to sit on the edge of the bed when suddenly Father Kennedy's voice runs through her head, saying that every day weâ€™re alive can be a miracle. She smiles slightly, and gets up slowly, exposing a pregnant belly. The alternate ending shows Linda getting up exactly as she does before. All of a sudden, she hears the shower running. She walks slowly to the bathroom, pulls open the shower curtain and the screen goes black.
