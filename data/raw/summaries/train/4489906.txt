As a relative newcomer to town, Dr. Mumford  seems charming and skillful to his neighbors and patients. His unique, frank approach to psychotherapy soon attracts patients away from the two therapists (David Paymer and [[Jane Adams  already working in the area. Soon he is treating a variety of conditions, ranging from one man's attachment to dime-store erotic novels to an unhappy woman's compulsive shopping. Mumford befriends a billionaire computer mogul ([[Jason Lee  and a cafe waitress  and he attempts to play matchmaker. He also begins to fall for a patient  who suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome. Together with an attorney , a patient Mumford had rejected because of his narcissism, the rival therapists conspire to find skeletons in Mumford's closet, hoping to destroy his reputation. And there are indeed skeletons galore, as a confidante of Mumford's soon finds out.
