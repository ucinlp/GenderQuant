Despite an approaching winter storm an airliner takes off. Soon the passengers find out there are hijackers on board who mercilessly follow through a ruthless plan that includes killing the pilots. The passengers try to hinder the terrorists attempt to turn the plane into a weapon, but they are not capable of overpowering them and merely experience increasing levels of violence as they arouse the terrorists' wrath. Meanwhile, as fighter aircraft take off and close in on the airliner, its hijackers indulge an increasing bloodlust. The air force obviously prepares to take the hijacked plane down but as the worsening snow storm unfolds a growing impact is felt on their jets' sensitive on-board electronics. Hence the military mission turns into a game of chance and the outcome might in the end just depend on the passengers' will to sacrifice themselves.
