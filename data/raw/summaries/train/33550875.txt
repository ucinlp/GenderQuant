Because William I, Elector of Hesse did not join the Confederation of the Rhine, he is on the run from Napoleon. In Frankfurt 1806, he gives obligations from his Hessians, worth £600,000, to Mayer Amschel Rothschild, so that Rothschild can carry them to England, into safety. But Rothschild uses the money to make profits for himself. His sons, Nathan Rothschild in London and James Rothschild in Paris support him at that. They use the electors money to finance the army of Wellington in the war against Napoleon in Spain. In 1815, Nathans makes his leeriest move, when he spreads the rumour, that Napoleon had won in the Battle of Waterloo, causing the stock prices in London to fall rapidly. When the truth is revealed, he had already bought equities for a ridiculously low price. After a decade, the Rothschilds had already accumulated a fortune of £11 million by using the electors money. Finally, Nathan joins forces with the commissioner of the British treasury, to enslave all Europe. The film ends with a burning Star of David over a map showing the major cities of Europe.
