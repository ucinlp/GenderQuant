The three-minute film follows the story of an Italian psychotic butcher named Lupo, who swears at his meat and has a huge temper when the smallest things go wrong. He eventually gets angry to the point that he cuts off his own thumb, his body falls apart, and a fountain of blood is unleashed. Then when the film looks like it is coming to an end, Lupo's severed head jumps into the credits box and comments about the people who worked on the film. He then falls asleep and the screen fades to black.
