Set during the early years of the California Gold Rush, the film tells of the adventures of Caroline Frost, the wilful and spoilt daughter of a US Senator. He does not approve of her beau, Lt Robert Latham, of the US cavalry, and persuades President James K Polk to post Latham to guard gold shipments from the California mines owned by Jake Carstair. Caroline travels by train and steamship and manages to join a wagon-train about to trek overland to the West. She falls in with Johnny, a debonair but ruthless gambler and two comically inept opportunists, Prince Gregory Stroganovsky and his much put-upon servant Koppa. Adapting slowly to the rigours of the journey, she first claims to be married to the Prince  and then further claims to be actually married to Carstair. She eventually reaches Sonora in California. Here, her problems are quickly sorted out. After some confusion between Carstair and his real wife, Caroline decides that she really loves Johnny. Her Father, who has followed her, is reconciled.
