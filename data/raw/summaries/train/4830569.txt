The plot of the film centers around Eddie , a young kid from upstate New York who is conned into fronting for a speakeasy on Broadway. There is a chorus-girl with a heart of gold , a cop-killing gangster boss, Hawk Miller  and his downtrodden ex-girlfriend . With the cops closing in on him, Hawk needs a fall guy. Planting contraband in poor Eddie's shop, the gang leader then instructs his henchmen to "take him for a ride" But Eddie escapes his "ride," and there is a final confrontation. Just as all hope seems lost, Hawk is killed by persons unknown. The murder weapon, however, belongs to the chorus girl and she is about to be arrested by Detective Crosby , when the real murderer—Miller's downtrodden ex-girlfriend—gives herself up.
