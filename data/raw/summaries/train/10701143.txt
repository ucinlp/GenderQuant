He makes a living as a con-man, gambling and picking pockets with the assistant of another poverty-stricken male, Choti. He has a friend in Ashok who sells Cavendar cigarettes on busy streets by wearing stilts. One day Ashok meets with a maidservant, Sonu Mangeshkar, and both fall in love with each.
