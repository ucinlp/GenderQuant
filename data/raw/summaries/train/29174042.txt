Kenan is a 35-year-old toll booth attendant still living with his father who suffers from heart disease. Shy and withdrawn, he prefers to live in his own head rather than engaging with the people around him. He works at a busy toll station, and is known to talk to himself occasionally while working. As with everyone else, his relationship with his father is one of reserve and distance. During the day, Nurgül takes care of Kenan’s ailing father. In her early 30s, talkative and maternal, Nurgül has known the family since her childhood, including Kenan’s mother who died many years ago. Stuck between work and home, Kenan’s humdrum life takes a dramatic turn when the newly appointed toll booth manager visits for supervision.
