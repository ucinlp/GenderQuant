Eve Tozer  is a society heiress and flapper living the high-life in 1920s Istanbul. She needs to find her father  before he is officially declared dead or risk losing her inheritance to his scheming business partner Bentik . She hires WWI ace-pilot Patrick O'Malley  and his planes to locate her father. O'Malley is eager to take the job as he needs to leave town rather urgently himself. However, Eve, also an accomplished pilot, is determined to accompany him in his other aircraft, which causes the first of many arguments between Istanbul and China. Their journey in two biplanes  through six countries leads them to finally find the eccentric Bradley Tozer in China, where he is helping a small village defend against a local warlord. O'Malley and Eve help them to win the final battle, however their one remaining plane is damaged in the process, leaving their immediate future actions uncertain.
