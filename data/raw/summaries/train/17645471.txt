At the start of World War II, Frenchmen from all walks of life enlist. Defeated by the invading Germans in 1940, Marshal Philippe PÃ©tain signs a peace agreement and the troops surrender. However, instead of being repatriated to their homes, a group of soldiers find themselves in a brutal prison camp. Most of the men resist as best they can, and some, like Paul , are willing to spend time in solitary confinement and be subjected to beatings, while others, such as Duval , collaborate with their jailers to get an easier life. The men find solace from Father Sebastian , a priest who was also in the army and who counsels them wisely. Eventually Paul helps his fellow prisoners to escape. When they liberate a village, they realise that continued fighting is the only option, so they join the French Resistance.
