The Salon is an independent feature film that was developed, financed and produced by Howard University grads David Odom and Mark Brown. In the movie, Jenny Smith  owns a modest neighborhood beauty parlor that is hugely popular with the folks who reside on her street, but mom-and-pop businesses are going belly-up all over the place and lately a corporate giant has been clamoring to set-up shop on the block. Despite formidable pressure from the Department of Water and Power, Jenny refuses to accept the offer made for her shop and decides to test her luck against the DWP in the local courthouse.
