Bomber pilot Joe Kelly crashes his plane, and is captured by enemy troops and loses his memory from a strike on his head after the crash. Joe is given a fallen comradeâ€™s identity tags and assumes another identity. When Joe is not found in the wreckage, he is assumed missing in action. After two years, he is presumed dead. The film then explores how his wife, Claire, sets out to find him, unaware that he had made it back to the States, under an assumed name. She is also unaware that Joe is suffering from amnesia. However, at the end of the movie, the B-24 bomber becomes a critical part of the plot when a wrecked B-24 is restored to save the day.
