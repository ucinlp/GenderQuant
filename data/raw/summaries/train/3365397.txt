Spoofing the classic Beau Geste and a number of other desert motion pictures, the film's plotline revolves around the heroic Beau Geste and his brother Digby's misadventures in the French Foreign legion out in the Sahara Desert, and the disappearance of the family sapphire, sought after by their money-hungry stepmother.  The cast features Ann-Margret as the brothers' adoptive mother, Peter Ustinov as the brutal Sergeant Markov and Sin√©ad Cusack as sister Isabel Geste, with Spike Milligan , Burt Kwouk , James Earl Jones , Avery Schreiber , Terry-Thomas , Trevor Howard , Henry Gibson , Roy Kinnear  and Ed McMahon  in supporting roles. The film was shot on location in Madrid, Spain and in Ireland at Ardmore Studios in Bray and on location at Kilmainham Gaol in Dublin and Adare Manor near Limerick.
