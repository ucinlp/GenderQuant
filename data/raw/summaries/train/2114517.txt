Young sci-fi/fantasy enthusiast Gavin Gore  and his ragtag group of nerd friends, girlfriend Sophie Suchowski , swordsman Hobie Plumber , and young Maynard Keyes  stumble upon some "large tracks" and a "big ole sasquatch dumplin'" whilst walking some trails in the nearby woods. Unbeknownst to the friends, two of Gavin's redneck neighbors, Zerk Wilder  and Shirts Joachim  planted some fake evidence as a plan to gain profits and pay off Zerk's credit card bill. Soon the publicity stunt gains the attention of a local Sasquatch "expert" .
