From the Sundance Program Description: "With the Internet surpassing print as our main news source, and newspapers going bankrupt, ... Page One chronicles the media industry’s transformation and assesses the high stakes for democracy ... The film deftly makes a beeline for the eye of the storm or, depending on how you look at it, the inner sanctum of the media, gaining unprecedented access to the New York Times newsroom for a year. At the media desk, a dialectical play-within-a-play transpires as writers like salty David Carr track print journalism’s metamorphosis even as their own paper struggles to stay vital and solvent, publishing material from WikiLeaks and encouraging writers to connect more directly with their audience. Meanwhile, rigorous journalism—including vibrant cross-cubicle debate and collaboration, tenacious jockeying for on-record quotes, and skillful page-one pitching—is alive and well. The resources, intellectual capital, stamina, and self-awareness mobilized when it counts attest there are no shortcuts when analyzing and reporting complex truths."{{cite web|urlwhat  to doc, 2011 Sundance Docs in Focus: PAGE ONE: A Year Inside the New York Times | authorStories and issues * Publication of Afghan war logs by WikiLeaks * Release of the iPad * Bankruptcy of the Tribune Company * NBC Universal merger with Comcast * The Jayson Blair scandal * Judith Miller * Gawker and its "Big Board" * Pro Publica and new models for investigative reporting * Charging for news online * Watergate and the Pentagon Papers * Staff cuts in Network News and coverage of the White House * The end of U.S. combat operations in Iraq
