Donald Duck is enjoying a leisurely day in his hammock sipping lemonade and listening to his radio. Soon Uncle Smiley's radio program comes on. Smiley is described as a "musical philosopher" and uses songs to maintain a positive attitude. Donald insists that he has never lost his temper, yet Donald's temper is first tried by a fly that lands on his foot, followed by a work which crawls down the underside of his hammock and tickles him. A chicken comes along and pecks Donald's rear end while trying to grab the worm. Finally Donald is confronted with an antagonistic woodpecker who finally causes him to loose his temper. At the end of the film Donald grabs his shotgun and smashes the radio.
