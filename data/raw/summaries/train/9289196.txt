Movie depicts Raman reaching for a concert in an inebriated state and Gopi is forced to take over. He is an instant hit with the masses. This has been depicted quite symbolically during the song Sree Vinayagam. Gopi's music, which was hidden behind his brother's charisma now flows out in full strength. Taking this as an insult, Raman starts hating his brother and strives hard to recover from alcoholism. His morale is shattered when organizers of the Tyagaraja Aaradhana select his brother over him to perform. He attends the concert in a drunken state but is able to appreciate his brother's talent. With a longing to get rid of the alcoholism and perform a concert with his brother, he sets on a pilgrimage, but was never to return. Gopi, getting to know that Raman is killed in an accident, is forced to conceal this truth because of their vocally disabled sister's marriage. Gopi gets lot of moral support with his love-interest, who also knows about the truth. Gopi's trauma reaches penultimate when his family comes to know about Raman's death and that Gopi was concealing it. Everything ends fine when the family understands his intentions.
