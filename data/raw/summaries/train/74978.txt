In 1882 , the Earp brothers  are driving cattle to California when they cross the Clanton family led by the "Old Man". Told of a nearby town, Tombstone, the older brothers ride in, leaving the youngest brother James to watch over the cattle. The Earps quickly find Tombstone a lawless town. Wyatt is the only man in the town who will face the drunkard Indian shooting at the townspeople. When they return to their camp, they find the cattle rustled and James dead. Seeking vengeance, Wyatt returns to Tombstone and takes the open job of town marshall, meeting with the local powers, Doc Holliday and the Clantons, again and again in order to find out who was responsible. In the meantime, a young woman from Boston named Clementine Carter arrives in town she is given a room at the same hotel when Wyatt and Doc Holliday stay.
