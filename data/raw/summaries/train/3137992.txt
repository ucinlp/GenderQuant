While watching late-night monster movies, Ben  had a vivid dream of flying over a space-like circuit board and shares his visions with his best friend Wolfgang  a young scientific genius who is able to translate his dreams into a complex circuit board that actually works. After one or two experimental tests they discover the circuit board creates an electorally generated sphere and by using a computer to steer it they can make it move anywhere in three dimensions even as far as slamming it through solid walls. With the help of their new friend Darren , they create a homemade spacecraft out of an old Tilt-A-Whirl car naming it the Thunder Road and embark on a secret adventure to another galaxy where they find that things are not always as different as they seem.
