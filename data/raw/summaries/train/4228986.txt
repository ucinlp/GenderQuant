 When free-spirited Alice develops a crush on a stranger at the train station, she offers her best friend, Hana, the stranger's "half brother," Masashi. Hana declines, but soon develops feelings for Masashi, beginning to stalk him as they ride the same train throughout the winter. In Spring, when Hana and Alice enter high school, Hana joins the story telling club after learning Masashi is also a member. Still fostering feelings for Masashi, she follows him secretly once more, and witnesses him crashing into a garage door, falling to the ground unconscious. After he has awoken, Hana lies to Masashi: she admits that not only did the blow to the head give Masashi a case of amnesia, but that he has also forgotten that Hana is his girlfriend. Hana and Masashi begin to date each other, though their entire relationship is based on Hana's lie, forcing Hana to keep lying in order to remain Masashi's girlfriend. Eventually, Alice is wrapped up in Hana's lie, playing the part of Masashi's ex-girlfriend. Through a subsequent series of events, a subtle love triangle develops between Hana, Alice, and Masashi, as Masashi begins to fall in love with Alice. The story ultimately culminates in Masashi's discovery of Hana's lie about his contrived case of amnesia. Though Hana and Alice's relationships were put to a test through the series of events, they eventually make amends, and they remain friends. Despite outward appearances, this film isn't just about puppy love, as it also tells the story of friendship between two girls, and the different situations in their lives .
