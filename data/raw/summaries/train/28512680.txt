The powers of Kirmada were destroyed by Krishna's Sudarshana Chakra in the movie Chhota Bheem Aur Krishna, but his soul manages to survive. His sister brings him back using her magic, but is unable to restore any power in him. Kirmada then requests the devil to give him more strength. In response, the devil informs him that he was killed by the Sudarshana chakra and cannot be resurrected, unless he absorbs the power of 1000 people and sacrifices himself into the fire, at which point Kirmada could get back his own form and power. Kirmada then enters the body of a saint residing in Pataliputra and absorbs the power of the king of Pataliputra, converting him into a zombie in the process. In the same way, he absorbs the power of many of the residents of Pataliputra. Kirmada sacrifices himself and returns to his own form. Bheem and his friends team up with Krishna to quell the disaster. After a hard fight, Bheem strikes Kirmada with his axe and destroys him. The powers he had absorbed get released, and the people return to their normal form. Kirmada's ghost tries to escape but Bheem shoots him out of the earth. The next day, Krishna is shown teasing to Bheem that he is about to leave. Bheem, thinking that Krishna is only joking, pays no heed to him. However, when he looks back, Krishna is gone. But the peacock feather dear to Krishna is blowing in the wind. They run after the feather as the film comes to a close.
