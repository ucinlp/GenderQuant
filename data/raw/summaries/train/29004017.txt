Emma is fourteen years old and lives with her parents and her older brother, Marcus, in a terrace house in Scania. She has many friends, but the contact between her and Marcus is not so good because he mostly thinks she is a tough and persistent little sister. The film is set during Emma's summer vacation. Emma and her friends are heading to a party at the home of one of Marcus' friends. Marcus is angry that Emma is at the party, and he thinks she does not belong there. He chooses not to go to the party because he does not want to party with his little sister. At the party, Emma becomes too drunk, falls asleep in a bed upstairs, and then one of Marcus' closest friends rapes her. Later, she falls in love with the skater Aron, but behaves strangely at times against him because of what happened at the party. After a period of several incidents, Marcus finally understands what his friend did to his little sister.
