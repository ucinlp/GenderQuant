Pappu is a relentless fighter for justice and equality from early childhood. He organises protest against his teacher who discriminates between the landlord's son and other children. The landlord is provoked to wrath, and Pappu is obliged to leave home. From now on, he has to lead a hard, tough life, fighting at every step to uphold his ideals. He takes odd jobs but had to give them up as he cannot stand the iniquity meted out by his employers. Ultimately, he settles down as a rickshaw-puller. He takes care of a child from the gutter. That child became so arrogant and proud when she grew up. She did not even want Pappu's presence. Pappu became a patient due to hard work. The subsequent developments reveal him as an extremely affectionate human being, seeking pleasure in doing good to others and demanding nothing for himself. The film ends with the girl realising her mistakes.
