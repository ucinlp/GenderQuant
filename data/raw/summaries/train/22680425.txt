Young art student Asli has lost a precious miniature-art book, but has no recollection of how it got misplaced. She and her medical student friend Nevin, having lost all hope due to her unexplained temporary amnesia, go through an intense hypnosis session under the supervision of an expert psychiatrist. As the psychiatrist helps Asli relive the day she lost the book, she unexpectedly comes across a mysterious stranger in the hypnosis world. A mystical eastern fairytale unfolds in both the world of hypnosis and the real world, as the characters, led by an unseen hand, are uncontrollably steered towards the mysterious Burgaz Island. Asli enters the realms of traditional Turkish fairy-tales and the uncharted world of hypnosis, through a journey into the ancient capital of the East, Istanbul.
