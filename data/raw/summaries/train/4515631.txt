In the beginning of the film a little boy named Tony Washington  watches his father William Washington  play in a baseball game. On the way home Tony, William and Tony's mother Louise  see a young girl  about to be raped by two teenagers. William saves the young girl from being raped but is killed when one of the rapists stabs him. Years pass, and Tony  is now grown up. When Tony comes back home, Louise reminds him about the groceries. Tony leaves to get groceries. Meanwhile, a group of teenagers Bob , Amy , Jim, Peter, and Susie are at a bar. They are soon kicked out because they are underage. Bob suggests they try to find some sleazy chicks and they take off in a car, driving recklessly down the street. Tony, now a musclebound teenage baseball player, is leaving a small grocery store where he had helped disrupt an attempted robbery. As he steps out of the store and into the road, he is run over by the gang of teenagers. Tonyâ€™s mother contacts one of her neighbors, a voodoo priestess, who happens to be the young girl who was saved by Tony's father earlier in the film when Tony was a child. She resurrects Tony as a zombie. Zombie-Tony goes on a killing spree, hunting down and killing the teenagers responsible for his death. The police captain, played by Adam West, turns out to be corrupt, and is one of the original attackers from the attempted rape of the young voodoo priestess. He follows Tony to the cemetery where he shoots and kills the priestess and her zombie, only to be pulled down into Hell by Tony's father.
