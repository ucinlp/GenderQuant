The film centres on a girl who wants a dog. She brings home a puppy but her mother wouldn't let the puppy stay. The girl is upset and goes outside to the playground where all the other kids are walking their dogs. She starts playing with her mitten, pretending that the mitten is a dog. And the power of her imagination turns her mitten into a knitted puppy, which keeps the mitten red color and black spots on the back. The puppy starts chasing a cat which ends up finding shelter on top of the ad board saying "Everyone who has a dog is welcome to take part in the kennel club competition!" The girl takes her puppy to the competition and it completes the task better than other dogs but on the way to the finish one of the threads of puppy's knitted coat gets caught by a nail on the wooden barrier and it looses the competition. The girl takes it home and is about to feed it, when it turns back to a mitten. Mom notices the girl trying to feed a mitten and decides to get her a real puppy.
