Maurice Giraud  is sent to New York to arrange for the Academy Ballet of America to come to Paris to compete for cash prizes at an international dance festival, but a cabbie takes him by mistake to the Club Ball√©, a nightclub about to go under. The desperate owners of the club, Terry Moore  and Duke Dennis , know that there's been an error, but see the invitation as a way out of their financial problems. To get some ballet into their nightclub act, they hire ballet teacher Luis Leoni  and his star  pupil Kay Morrow  to teach their girls ballet on the boat crossing the Atlantic. Terry finds Kay very attractive, but things are complicated when his ex-wife, Mona , invites herself along, rooming with Kay. Meanwhile, the head of the real ballet company, Padrinsky , finds out what's happened and cables Giraud aboard ship, then heads to Paris with his patron, a ballet-loving gangster named Mike Coogan , who intends to rub out Terry and Duke. Giraud is upset about being hoaxed, but is mollified when a "talking dog"  convinces him that Padrinsky is the liar. After they arrive in Paris, a representative of the exposition, Pierre Le Brec , wants to watch the group's rehearsals, and Duke tells his new friend Coogan, the gangster, that Le Brec is causing him trouble. Coogan goes to "take care" of the problem, but by mistake knocks out Leoni instead of Le Brec. Padrinsky shows up and arranges for the imposters to be deported on the day of the contest, but Mona manages to change the order so that Coogan and Padrinsky are shipped out instead, which allows the company to perform and win the grand prize.Arthur Hausner IMDB Plot SummaryTCM Full Synopsis
