Luisa Ginglebusher  is a young, naive orphan who is given a job as an usherette in a Budapest movie palace. Detlaff , a waiter she meets in the theatre, takes her to an exclusive party where, to hold off the advances of Konrad , a meat-packing millionaire a little too fond of drink, she picks a name from the phone book to be her "husband", hoping to do a good deed and divert some of Konrad's wealth to someone else. When the lucky man, stuffy but poor Dr. Max Sporum , gets a 5-year employment contract and a big bonus from Konrad, he thinks the millionaire is interested in him because of his ethical behavior, diligent hard work and integrity, but actually Konrad plans to send the "husband" to South America so that he will be free to seduce the girl. Many complications ensue when Lu gets curious about Sporum, and pays him a visit.<ref nameavg&sql76697&category=Full%20Synopsis Full synopsis]Crawford, Rod Plot summary
