Bill Garvin , a labourer on the Woolloomooloo wharf, is happily married to Nell  and they have a little daughter, Peggy . When Bill breaks his leg, Nell has to go to work. She is a success, saving up money for her daughter, but falls ill after an operation and dies, making Bill promise that he will bring up Peggy a lady. Bill puts his daughter in a convent school and sets about earning as much money for her as he can to pay the school fees, becoming a street singer in partnership with a musician who plays on street corners. Peggy grows up  and stays with a wealthy school friend, Joy Gilder, at her family station in Queensland over the holidays. She falls in love with Joy's brother Geoffrey Gilden  and they agree to be married. A dinner party is held for Bill to meet his future in-laws but, despite buying a suit and reading a book on etiquette, he is not a social success and Peggy is embarrassed by him. She breaks off the engagement and returns to the convent. Bill is upset by this but gets inspiration from a book he read to Peggy when he was little, The Prince and the Beggar Maid. He tells Geoffrey's parents that Peggy is not his real daughter - he adopted her after her real parents, respectable English people, died. The Gilders believe the story, Peggy marries Geoffrey, and Bill visits Nell's grave to tell her that her wishes have been carried out.
