Suzanne  and her young stepdaughter Molly Driscoll  move into a new house, where Molly acquires an imaginary friend named Candace Brewer . Later, it is revealed that a girl by that name lived in the house about a century earlier. Her mother died during childbirth of her baby sister, Dora. Candace took her baby sister and left her on a church steps so she didn't have to suffer the abuse from her father like she did. When she returned home, her father knew she took the baby and hung Candace on the apple tree in the backyard. Everyone believed 10 year old Candace hung herself so she was buried in the part of the cemetery where sinners were buried, since suicide was considered a sin. The plot centers around whether Candace is indeed imaginary or is a malevolent ghost. Despite Suzanne's effort to evict the ghost out of her new husband's house, Candace still held the threat of making Suzanne's new family shatter. All the while, Suzanne's husband remains unbelieving of all of this.
