A group of LA twenty-somethings are lured out of the city and out into the wilderness in search of a rave, a hot girl, and good times. Instead, they encounter an ancient evil; a demon capable of possessing humans. As the demon passes through the group, each becomes both killer and victim. As their numbers dwindle the question arises: can they stop this malevolent spirit from spreading or will his power be to great for them?
