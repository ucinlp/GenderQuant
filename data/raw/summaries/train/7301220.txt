= A colonel's mousy wife writes a book of poetry under a pseudonym but is immediately unmasked by the papers. The colonel does not read the poetry  and is surprised when a friend says it is "not suitable for children." Another friend says it has "naked, earthy passion" and compares it to Sappho. The book is a success and sells "like hot-cakes," becoming the talk of the town. Even the colonel's mistress has an interest in it. After listening to much talk about how “sexy” the book is, the colonel finally asks his mistress to borrow her copy, then insists she tell him about it. The book is about a middle-aged woman falling in love with, and having an affair with, a younger man, told in the first person. After a torrid affair, the younger man dies. The mistress says it is so vivid that it must be based on a real experience, but the colonel insists his wife is “too much of a lady,” and that it must be fiction. Still, he is tortured by the insinuation that is could be true but is too afraid to ask his wife about it. Eventually, of course, sensing his unease, she tells him the passion was based on his love for her, as it was when they were young. She blames herself for the “death” of that love. They end in an embrace.
