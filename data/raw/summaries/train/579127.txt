The quirky but down-to-earth residents of the small hamlet of Highwater, Vermont, are faced with the freshly dead body of Harry Worp , which has inconveniently appeared on the hillside above the town. The problem of what to do with the body and, more importantly, how and why Harry was killed is the "trouble with Harry". Three of the main characters in the film each believe at some point that they are the one who actually killed Harry. Captain Wiles  is sure that he killed the man with a stray shot from his rifle while hunting, until it is shown he actually shot a rabbit. Spunky and independent young Jennifer Rogers , Harry's estranged wife who along with her small son Arnie  ran away from the loveless marriage, believes that he died after she hit him with a milk bottle after he tracked her down. Miss Gravely  feels that the man died after a blow from the heel of her hiking boot after he came at her out of the bushes . Sam Marlowe , an attractive and nonconformist artist, is open-minded about the whole event and is prepared to help his friends and neighbors in any way he can. In any case, nobody is upset about this death. However, none of the principal characters want the body to come to the attention of the "authorities" in the form of cold, humorless Deputy Sheriff Calvin Wiggs , who earns his living per arrest. The main characters conceal the body by burying it and then have to dig it up again. This happens several times. The body is also concealed at one point by hiding it in a bathtub. In the end it is established that Harry actually died of natural causes; no foul play was involved. In the meantime, Sam and Jennifer have fallen in love, as have the Captain and Miss Gravely. Sam has been able to sell his paintings to a passing millionaire. The artist refuses to accept money and instead requests a few simple gifts for his friends and himself.
