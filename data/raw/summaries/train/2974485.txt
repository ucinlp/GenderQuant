A group of veteran British sergeants, headed by an ultra-correct, order-barking Regimental Sergeant Major, are caught between two dissident factions in an unnamed newly-created African state . The story neatly exposes the feelings of the professional NCOs, their officers and the African soldiers and officers, who are still painfully new to both guns and political slogans. When the post-colonial government of the unnamed African country is overthrown by a populist uprising, troops loyal to the new administration take over the barracks, arrest the commanding officer and seize weapons. With the British NCOs cut off in the Sergeants' mess during the mutiny, the action boils down to the initiative and confusion of the griping, duty-hardened British soldiers in defending Captain Abraham , and themselves, against their former allies. The mess situation is further complicated by having to temporarily accommodate a female British MP and a UN secretary, the latter providing some love interest. Eventually the minor action comes to anti-climactic end when the country's new administration allows the senior British officers to return to the barracks at Batasi and end the siege, but not before the RSM and a private involve themselves in some 'action'. The film concludes with the news that a new government is in power. The film illustrates an erupting new world where the so-called common man, both black and white, no longer has a clear idea of the realpolik due to the social revolutions in a post-colonial world.
