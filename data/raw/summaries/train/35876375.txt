An employee of Lentera Merah, the campus newspaper of the University of Indonesia, is found dead in the office with the number 65 written in blood by his body. In the meantime, five students compete for a position at the publication: Risa Priliyanti , Riki , Lia , Muti  and Yoga . As part of their entrance test, they must cover supposedly haunted portions of the university campus. Another Lentera Merah staff member, Wulan  is found hanged in the library. The rector forbids the test after these murders are known, but chief editor Iqbal  insists that the five students go through the initiation rites to show their mettle as journalists. Lia and Risa go with staff photographer Bayu . After several more staff members are killed, it is discovered that Risa is in fact the ghost of a former Lentera Merah staff member who was killed in 1965 after being accused of being a communist sympathiser; her body was later buried under the floor of one of the buildings. They realise that Risa is killing them because they are related to the staff members who killed her. Iqbal's father, a Lentera Merah staff member in 1965, comes to the campus to warn his son. As the remaining students leave to find Risa's body and give it a proper burial, Risa appears and strangles Iqbal's father. Having found closure, she vanishes.
