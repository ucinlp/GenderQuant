Master Liu and Master Law are rival masters of Shaolin style kung fu, and Wutang style sword fighting, running schools in the same city. Their top students, Chao Fung-wu , and Hung Jun-kit , are actually close friends, with Jun-kit's sister, Yan-ling, having a crush on Fung-wu. After observing the two students fighting at a brothel, two of the local Qing Lord's  soldiers report the power of the styles to him. The Lord determines that the two styles are dangerous, and he must learn both. After poisoning Master Law, and having Yan-ling killed, the Qing Lord is able to learn both Wudang 8 Divine Sword style and Shaolin Chin kang fist from a spy. Fung-wu and Jun-kit both return to their respective temples for training, as a priest and monk, respectively. Jun-kit hopes to revenge his sister's death, and Fung-wu also wants to avenge his master's death. The Qing Lord has since learned both the styles, but because he did not learn either from a master, his grasp on both styles is not perfect. To overcome this deficiency, he decides to have the Wudang and Shaolin destroy each other, so he may be the only master of both styles. To do this, he stages a martial arts contest between the two temples, hoping to appeal to the traditional rivalry between the Shaolin and the Wudang. Jun-kit , and Fung-wu , are selected by their respective temples as the representatives. The Qing Lord, in his impatience to see both Wutang and Shaolin destroyed, admits his true motives, and his role in Yan-ling and Master Law's deaths. Tat-chi and Ming-kai must then combine Shaolin Chin kang fist and Wutang 8 Divine Sword style to defeat him.
