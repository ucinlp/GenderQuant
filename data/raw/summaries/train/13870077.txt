Oldrich "Fajolo" Fajták , a student who directs quasi-existentialist verbal abuse at his girlfriend Bela Blažejová , takes off to a formally-volunteer summer work camp at a farm, actually mandated by the authorities, which inspires both him and Bela to start a relationship with someone else. A parallel story peels layers off Bela's permanently tense home life marked by her blind mother's  studied helplessness, and her father's  revealed infidelity and past break with his father  who happens to live in the village where Fajolo is finding some consolation in the arms of a fellow student-volunteer Jana . As Fajolo begins to pry into Bela's grandfather's secrets, she, in turn, allows her new boyfriend Peťo  to read and deride Fajolo's discursive and indirectly remorseful letters from the farm. The solar eclipse barely discerned by the main characters through thick clouds at the beginning of the film is echoed by summer and fall images of the sunJasmine Pogue, "Štefan Uher: The Sun in a Net  1963." as they present themselves to all of them at various points in the film through a fisherman's net from his pontoon on the Danube beyond the city's suburbs, which Fajolo and Peťo have discovered independently and use as a swimming deck, a place to ponder life, or to try to seduce Bela. When, however, Bela brings her mother and brother Milo  to the pontoon after a series of subdued interpersonal crises, the pontoon is on dry land because the water level has dropped, and the film ends with Bela and Milo lying to their mother about what they can see as they did about the visibility of the eclipse during the opening sequences.
