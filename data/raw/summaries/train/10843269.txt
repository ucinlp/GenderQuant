A "Hitlerjugend" kind of story, set in the Soviet Union during the Second World War. Year 1943. Colonel Vishnevetskiy is released from prison to organize a school of military training for saboteurs. Students come from prisons and correction colonies; these are 14â€“15 years old criminals who nobody will even look for. After severe training they are sent to destroy a Nazi Oil Depot deep in the Carpathians. Being lost high in the mountains and being on the edge of life and death, you still can make a choice: to remain a bastard or become a hero for a country that doesn't want you.
