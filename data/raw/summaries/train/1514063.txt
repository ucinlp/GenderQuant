Working with a large sum of inherited money, two scientists build a rocket to take them to the Moon. Once there, they discover that the Moon's surface is covered with lush, tropical vegetation and giant golden nuggets. The astronauts are soon captured, however, by a colony of telepathic lunar nudists . Much of the film deals with the men's efforts to collect data documenting their discovery and well as with the burgeoning romance between the younger of the two astronauts and the queen of the Moon people. On their return, they realise that the most important evidence, the camera, has been left behind.
