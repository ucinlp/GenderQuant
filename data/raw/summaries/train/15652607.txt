Young surfer Mike Samson , the local beach jock, is quite the ladies man until he meets Delilah Dawes . At first, he tries to add her to his harem, but she rejects him because she finds him chauvinistic and shallow; so he disguises himself as a nerdy twin brother "Herbert". In the meantime, publisher Harvey Pulp  plans to start a new magazine called “Teen Scream” and joins forces with “Daddy” , car, surfboard, skateboard, etc. customizer — and the owner of the local music club, The Dungeon — to publicize the venture. Pulp and Daddy organize a series of contests, and Delilah competes against "Mike" with the encouragement of "Herbert" in various events and loses each time. However, Mike finds that he is falling in love with her. Eventually, Delilah finds out about the deception and soon the two of them compete in a final race using various vehicles.
