Buddy Manucci (played by Scheider, a loose remake of the character of Buddy "Cloudy" Russo he played in [[The French Connection  has been getting flak from the higher-ups in the New York City police force he works for because his team of renegade policemen, known as The Seven-Ups  has been using unorthodox methods to capture criminals; this is illustrated as the team ransacks an antiques store that is a front for the running of counterfeit money. Also, lately, there has been a rash of kidnappings; the twist is that it seems that only upper echelon criminals  are the ones being kidnapped, illustrated when Max Kalish is kidnapped and a ransom is paid at a car wash. This leads to many plot twists in which Manucci tries to figure out the puzzle, with help supplied to him by an informant , who turns out to be untrustworthy, leading to the death of one of the Seven-Up officers. Manucci figures out the puzzle, but not before The Seven-Ups splinter from the fallout of the film's events, and Manucci's life is placed in jeopardy.
