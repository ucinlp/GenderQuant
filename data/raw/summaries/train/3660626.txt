Three wealthy, savvy high school seniors, Stream Hodsell , a smart, down-to-earth strawberry blonde, sassy Jenny Simon , who masks her intelligence behind a guise of fishnet stockings, and soulful Nell Kellner  attend the prestigious and expensive Halton School in Manhattan and have everything - brains, beauty, money, popularity, powerful parents, and boyfriends like Chad  and a garage band musician, Henry Rockefeller Lipschitz . They have it all but are still unfulfilled. After losing her virginity without obtaining sexual satisfaction, Stream is confused as well as unfulfilled and studies the problem with self-help books, women's magazines and the comically misinformed advice of her peers. Judy Hodsell  is Stream's distracted ex-hippie mom, Dick Hodsell  is her yuppie father with a new young girlfriend, Mimi , and Mr. Jennings  is a feel-good career counselor.
