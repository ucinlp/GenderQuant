The movie features scenes of Laurer and Waltman taking a guided tour of China, intercut with footage of the pair participating in explicit anal, vaginal, and oral sex acts, with special emphasis on an anal sex scene, which serves as the climax of the film. Waltman appears to be under the influence of marijuana during much of the film, something which he later admitted to in an interview.
