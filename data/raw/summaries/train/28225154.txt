The film tells the story of Horace  and Cassandra  who meet while traveling to Canada. The pair skirt around their feelings as Gerwig deals with an illness which she's keeping to herself. "Because they’re damaged in similar ways — we learn they’re both the black sheep of their respective families — they make for sweet-and-sour traveling companions, or would if Cassandra didn’t keep disappearing on Horace. The people they meet on the road offer varying object lessons in coping with the disaster of living. A comically mismatched couple at a roadside motel  seem ready to seduce our heroes or at least drag them into a discussion of superheroes as modern gods. A hermit  offers Horace and Cassandra beds for the night, a musical interlude, and a glimpse of one man’s sad isolation. The closest the movie gets to a statement comes from an older man in a diner  who locates nirvana in the act of tying flies." <ref name'Northern Comfort' movie review - 'Northern Comfort' showtimes|authorMay 28, 2010|workOctober 18, 2010}}
