A psychological drama about love, longing, homosexual desire and psychological turmoilâ€”i.e., the perils of puberty. Ito is a shy boy in the top class at secondary school. He feels attracted to his classmate and best friend Yoshida, who is not aware of Ito's intimate feelings. They spend much time with Kanbara, whose comic actions hide his sensitive nature. Aihara  is new at school and remains aloof with her cool attitude. No one knows that at her previous school she was raped and is now in therapy. Meanwhile Yoshida, who is currently involved with the insecure Shimizu, is interested in Aihara, the mysterious new girl. It is obvious that each teen is hiding behind a wall which they must break through during this tough process of maturation.
