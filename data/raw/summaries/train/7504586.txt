Betty wakes up after the morning after her birthday party. The house is a shambles, and Betty is not looking forward to cleaning up. She sings the title song while struggling with her chores. Grampy shows up to take Betty out for a drive, but Betty can't leave until everything is tidy. Grampy literally puts on his thinking cap , and invents a host of labor-saving devices: a cuckoo clock powered dishwasher, a combination bicycle and floor scrubber, and a player piano that folds laundry. In no time at all, the dancing inventor has the house spic and span, just in time to take Betty for a spin in his automobile .
