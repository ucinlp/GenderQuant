Three men, previously unknown to each other, are arrested in New Orleans and placed in the same cell. Both Zack , a disc jockey, and Jack , a pimp, have been set up, neither having committed the crime for which they have been arrested. Their cellmate Bob , an Italian tourist who understands minimal English, was imprisoned for manslaughter. Zack and Jack soon come to blows and thereafter avoid speaking to each other. Bob has an irrepressible need for conversation. He hatches a plan to escape, and before long the three are on the run through the swamp surrounding the prison. Hopelessly lost and with a simmering hatred between Jack and Zack almost causing the party to split up, they are brought together by Bob's ability to provide food. The trio eventually chance across a house in the forest, the residence of Nicoletta . Bob and Nicoletta instantly fall in love, and Bob decides to stay with her in the forest. Zack and Jack go their separate waysâ€”an unspoken, begrudging friendship hanging between them as they part.
