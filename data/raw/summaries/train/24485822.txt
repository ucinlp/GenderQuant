A dysfunctional family of bail bondsmen pursues bad guys by day and attempts to coach a peewee football team to the state championships by night in writer/director Harris Mendheim's rollicking feature debut. Big Donald Trawick  is an Alabama bounty hunter who has trained his two sons JD  and Tucker  to follow in the family business. But color-blind JD seems more interested in blowing things up than chasing down a paycheck, and when he isn't fighting, well-endowed community college dropout Tucker is too fixated on bedding the beneficiary whose namesake graces his former alma mater to care about a few troublesome bail jumpers. Meanwhile, schizophrenic mom Nanny  is a reformed rumrunner whose formidable driving skills have served the family business fairly well over the years, helping them to track down more than a few wily fugitives. The Trawick's latest target is Rusty McAndrews, a crack-smoking renegade welder determined never to see the inside of a jail cell again. As troublesome as McAndrews may be to pin down, however, he isn't nearly as much of a nuisance to the Trawicks as Cletus Yoates , a man whose determination to tarnish the family's good name both on the gridiron and off is now threatening to have lasting repercussions. ~ Jason Buchanan, All Movie Guide
