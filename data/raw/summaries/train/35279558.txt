Bhooter Bhabishyat - though it is a ghost story, it is meant to be a comic entertainer. The story is about a haunted house which is being pulled down and being replaced with a swanky shopping mall. Apparently, the ghosts who belong to different time zones consider this as their home so what happens later on shapes the rest of the story.
