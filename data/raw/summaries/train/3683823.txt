Concert pianist Henry Orient  is trying to have an affair with a married woman, Stella Dunnworthy , while two teenage private-school girls, Valerie Boyd  and Marian Gilbert , stalk him and write their fantasies about him in a diary. Orient's paranoia leads him to believe that the two girls, who seem to pop up everywhere he goes, are spies sent by the husband of his would-be mistress. When Val's mother, Isabel Boyd , finds their diary, she suspects that Henry has acted inappropriately with her daughter. She contacts Orient and they end up having an affair. Val finds out about it, as does her dad.
