Eighteen-year-old Do Wan-deuk  lives with his hunchback father, Gak-seol , and the stuttering Min-gu , former cabaret clowns now having to work in open-air markets after the closure of the nightclub they used for many years. Wan-deuk never knew his mother, who walked out 17 years ago, and has become a young brawler. His unconventional high school teacher, Lee Dong-ju , who treats all his students with equal harshness, lives on the rooftop next door and is always on Wan-deuk's back. Both are perpetually insulted by a grouchy neighbour , who lives with his younger sister Lee Ho-jeong , a writer of "existential martial arts novels" under the pen-name Moonbow. When Gak-seol and Min-ju start going on the road looking for work, Gak-seol asks Dong-ju to keep an eye on his son, and the two become closer. Dong-ju tells Wan-deuk his mother, Lee Suk-gi , is actually a Filipina, now working in a restaurant in Seongnam, a satellite city south of Seoul. Thanks to Dong-ju, mother and son finally meet for the first time. Meanwhile, Jeong Yun-ha , the brightest pupil in class, has taken a liking to Dong-ju after splitting with her boyfriend Hyeok-ju . When Wan-deuk takes up kickboxing to funnel his aggression, Yun-ha helps him. But just when Wan-deuk has come to rely on Dong-ju's tutorship, the latter is arrested by the police for helping illegal immigrant workers.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}
