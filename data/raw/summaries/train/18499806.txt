Young drifter Axel Nordmann  arrives at the waterfront on the west side of Manhattan, seeking employment as a longshoreman, and giving his name as "Alex North." He goes to work in a gang of stevedores headed by Charlie Malik  a vicious bully, and is befriended by Tommy Tyler , who also supervises a stevedore gang. Malik resents blacks in positions of authority, and is antagonized when Axel goes to work for Tommy. Axel moves into Tommy's neighborhood and becomes friends with Tommy's wife Lucy  and becomes romantically involved with her friend Ellen . Tommy serves as a mentor to Axel, urging him to stand up to Malik, and that if he does he will be "ten feet tall." It is apparent from the start that Axel is hiding something, and it emerges that he is a deserter from the United States Army. Malik is aware of that, and is extorting money from him. Malik frequently tries to provoke Tommy and Axel into fights, with Tommy coming to Axel's aid. Malik finally provokes Tommy into a fight, with both men using their baling hooks. Tommy at one point disarms Malik and implores him to stop, but Malik seizes the hook and kills him. The police investigation is stymied by lack of cooperation from the longshoremen, including Axel. But after meeting with the distraught Lucy, who accuses him of never being Tommy's friend, Axel finally decides to cooperate. He goes to Malik to tell him that. They get into a fight, and in the end, though beaten, Axel strangles Malik unconscious and drags him away.
