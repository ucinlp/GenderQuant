Passengers on a plane headed from the Midwest to the West Coast  get quite ill after eating the chicken pot pie entree. Both pilots also ate the chicken. A man who has not flown since the Vietnam War  is reluctantly pressed into flying the plane, where he makes a very neurotic, but survivable landing. The theme would be used again in Airplane!, which was a spoof of the movie classic Zero Hour!.
