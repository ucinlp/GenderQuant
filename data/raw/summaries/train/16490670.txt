The beginning is promising, at any rate, as you watch a Don't-Care Murugesan  limp sorrowfully from the Central Jail, Palayamkottai, in a scruffy beard and glasses. He has been incarcerated for 17 years. Naturally, there's a story which rewinds from 1989. In those halcyon days, he's an unruly youngster in pretty village Sivasailam, , the son of a hard-working flower-sellers , with Thapaal Thangavelu , who provides as much laughter as the posts he delivers. Life is a long, sunny adventure for Murugesan who beats people up, sells his grandfather's land, runs over rooftops  and incurs so much of his father's wrath that he's prophesied to meet a horrible end. Not that this gloomy prospect affects Murugesan—he continues on his own sweet way until he runs smack into Parijatham , a demure, fair-complexioned, striking Iyer girl, the daughter of Panjami Iyer  and the younger sister of Gayatri ([[Simran . Thus we have the first half which is a series of rollicking fun interspersed with logical sequences; the two have sudden and quirky escapades. In the meantime, the village's bigwig , who is magnanimous in public and a tyrant at home, casts his eyes on Parijatham. What sets his characterization apart is that he is not your average villain who shrieks and carries away the heroine; he places his pawns carefully, and is afraid of being found out. He and Murugesan come close to breaking each other's bones many times—but the situations defuse themselves in a perfectly natural fashion. Several twists in the tale occur in a quick fashion, and Murugesan and Parijatham are bound in a net from which, seemingly, there is no escape.
