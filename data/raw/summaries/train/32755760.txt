Mr Bhatti is a delusional character who wins a trip to the Lake District out of the blue. He comes over with a group of Indian tourists visiting the Lake District. Bhatti is under the impression that he has been called over by George W. Bush for supposed peace talks being the delusional man he is.

Brij Bhushan Bhatti  is a nerdy assistant bank manager and a wannabe private detective who keeps calling up the White House because he wants to talk to the US President George Bush and share his 'peace plan' with him. When the intolerable Bhatti gets a mysterious package containing details of a free vacation to Liverpool, he jumps at the chance…and straight into a murky plot involving a lookalike terrorist named Abu Siddique  with a diabolical plan to blow up various parts of the United Kingdom, a moll Katie , who talks in an irritating baby voice, a cop Javed Khan , who wants Bhatti to infiltrate Siddique's gang to ferret out information, a Pakistani staying in London  and a motley crew of other equally asinine characters, who seem hell-bent on ruining the viewer's day.
