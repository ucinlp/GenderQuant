Steve Tobias  is an undercover agent of CIA whose son, Mark , is getting married to Melissa Peyser . Her father is mild-mannered foot doctor, Jerry Peyser . When the two families meet for dinner, Peyser stumbles on to Steve Tobias' secret operation as he tries to set up a deal to sell a Russian submarine, the Olga, to an arms smuggler in France as a bait. As Peyser's incidental involvement increases, he is suspected by the FBI of being part of a seemingly malicious deal. Dragged kicking and screaming, Peyser decides he doesn't want to be involved in the deal or with Tobias' family. The two fathers-in-law end up dodging bullets, jumping off buildings, and stealing jets together as they attempt to avoid capture by the FBI.
