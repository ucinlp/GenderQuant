Roar of the Iron Horse had hero Jock Mahoney in his first leading role, playing Jim Grant, a railroad agent, opposing a typical hardfaced German, George Eldred, called The Baron. Head of a strong ring in America, the infamous Baron was thwarted time and time again as he tried to sabotage the building of the transcontinental railroad with all the means to his scope, strategically bribing the local Indians into doing his dirty work. Mahoney was an ideal choice to play the lead character, and the role marked the beginning of a long and rewarding association with Columbia Pictures.
