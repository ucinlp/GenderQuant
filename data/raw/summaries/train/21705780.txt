Set in the midst of the 2000 presidential election, American Violet tells the story of Dee Roberts , a 24 year-old African-American single mother of four, living in a small Texas town . One day, while Dee is working a shift at the local diner, the powerful local district attorney  leads a drug bust, sweeping Dee’s housing project. Police drag Dee from work in handcuffs, dumping her in the women’s county prison. Indicted based on the uncorroborated word of a single and dubious police informant facing his own drug charges, Dee soon discovers she has been charged as a drug dealer. Even though Dee has no prior drug record and no drugs were found on her in the raid or any subsequent searches, she is offered a hellish choice: plead guilty and go home as a convicted felon or remain in prison and fight the charges thus, jeopardizing her custody and risking a long prison sentence. Despite the urgings of her mother , and with her freedom and the custody of her children at stake, she chooses to fight the district attorney. Dee works with an ACLU attorney  and a former local narcotics officer  to take on the Texas justice system.Samuel Goldwyn Films - American Violet
