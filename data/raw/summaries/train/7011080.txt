While on a camping trip, sheep rancher Dan Logan  and his son are inadvertently exposed to a secret Army nerve gas from a plane passing overhead. Both end up in a military hospital where they are kept apart, unable to contact outsiders and lied to about their condition by a mysterious major  who looks at the incident as little more than an opportunity to study the effectiveness of a nerve gas on humans. Logan tries to hold someone accountable for their actions, but he and his family physician  are stone-walled from every angle by military authorities and by bureaucrats staging a cover up -- with those responsible already well insulated by their positions of power. After he discovers that his young boy has died, Logan goes on a terrorism spree against the company responsible for manufacturing the lethal poison before it also kills him.
