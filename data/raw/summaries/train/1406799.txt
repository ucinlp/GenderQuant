Schultze <ref name/20050310/REVIEWS/50301008/1001 Schultze Gets the Blues] Roger Ebert is a large, recently retired salt-miner living in Teutschenthal . Along with his also laid-off friends Jürgen and Manfred, he finds himself restless with so much spare time. For years, he has played traditional polka music on his accordion, but a series of upheavals in his life inspire an interest in American Zydeco and Cajun music. Though being afraid of travelling to the United States at the beginning he accepts his music club's wish to represent it at a German folk music festival in New Braunfels, Texas. But instead of appearing there he chooses to travel in a motor boat around the countryside despite speaking little English, immersing himself in the music and culture of the Bayou. Finally, among his newly found friends he becomes very sick and presumably dies. Back in Teutschenthal a funeral is held for Schultze which turns into a decent and mildly happy celebration of his life: "Herr, lehre uns Bedenken, dass wir alle einmal sterben müssen, auf das wir im Leben klug werden" - "Lord, teach us to understand we all have to die sometime, that we become wiser in our lives" .
