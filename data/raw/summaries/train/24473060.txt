Four years later, Dr. Anand, who treated her while she was giving birth to Raju  re-enters her life and soon becomes a frequent visitor, much to the displeasure of Ratna's mother-in-law  and her husband's sister Bela, both of whom start maltreating her and making her life miserable. Anand stops visiting thereafter. Anand soon marries a nurse called Maya Verma . Maya is a squanderer, and her relationship with Anand falters. Moreover, he later finds out that she cannot conceive. When Anand's dad passes away, he leaves considerable wealth to Anand's child, including a fair monthly allowance. Maya plots with an advocate, S. Prakash , who happens to be Bela's husband, to fabricate a story that Anand's father was mentally unbalanced while writing the testament. This plan fails, and along with her aunt, Nurse Sarla Verma , make a false statement claiming that Ratna's son is actually Anand's biological son, leading to their lawyer filing a custodial case in court.
