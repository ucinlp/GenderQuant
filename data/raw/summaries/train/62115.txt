French painter Michel Marnet  meets American singer Terry McKay  aboard a liner crossing the Atlantic Ocean. They are both already engaged, he to heiress Lois Clarke , she to Kenneth Bradley . Nonetheless, they fall in love. At a stop at Madeira, they visit Michel's grandmother Janou , who approves of Terry. The couple make an appointment to meet six months later on top of the Empire State Building. However, tragedy strikes; Terry is struck by a car on her way to the rendezvous and is told that she may be crippled, though that will not be known for certain for several months. Not wanting to be a burden to Michel, she does not contact him, preferring to let him think the worst. They meet by accident at the theater, though Terry manages to conceal her condition. Michel then visits her at her apartment and finally learns the truth. He assures her that they will be together no matter what the diagnosis will be.
