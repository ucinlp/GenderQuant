The movie is set on December 31, 1952, and has the country western singer Hank Williams being driven to a concert in Ohio. As he sits in the back seat of the car, he imagines a show he wishes he was giving. In this fantasy show, set in a bar, Williams sings many songs and talks about his personal life and religious philosophies. The movie cuts back and forth from the fictional show to the car. At the end, Williams sings the song "Men With Broken Hearts" to the crowd. He asks them to pray for him and wishes them a happy new year, then he walks out of the bar as bells toll. Back in the car, the real Williams dies. He was only 29 years old. On EW.COM, "Entertainment Weekly" gave the movie a "B+" when it was reviewed on November 27, 1992. Ken Tucker wrote that the film "still fascinates because it taps into the deep melancholy power of its subject" and noted "dark, eerie and atmospheric, this 'Show' is a heartfelt work".
