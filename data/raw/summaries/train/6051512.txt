The plot is a twist on the usual Elmer-chasing-Bugs cartoon, with the bunny's pursuer this time being a dopey American Indian. The Indian's body shape, along with the glasses he wears, suggest that he is meant to be a parody of Ed Wynn, although the voice does not match. Most of the episode is spent with Bugs getting vengeance by "thinking up some more deviltry for that Apache." At the climactic moment, Bugs, looking at the camera, says "Imagine this guy! Just who does he think he is to be chasin' me?", the Indian answers, holding Bugs at arrow-point, "Me? Me last Mohican!". "Last of the Mohicans, eh?", Bugs says, "Well, look, Geronimo, cast your eyes skywards." Looking up, he sees several storks carrying infant versions of the goofy Indian, and passes out. Bugs, laughing hysterically, happens to cast his own eyes skyward, and sees hundreds of storks carrying infant bunnies, who shout, in unison, "Eh, what's up, Pop?" Bugs then passes out, falling on top of the unconscious Indian. Iris-out.
