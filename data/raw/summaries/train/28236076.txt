Seventeen-year-old Joshua "Josh" McGuire , expedition bank-roller Carl Hurley  and his girlfriend, Victoria "Vic" Elaine , travel to the Esa'ala Cave, an underwater cave exploration site in Papua New Guinea. Josh's father, Frank , a master diver, has already established a forward base camp at a lower level inside the cave, where the team has been exploring for weeks. While exploring a section of the cave known as Devil's Restriction, Judes  experiences a problem with her air tank hose. She loses use of her air mask so Frank buddy breathes. After a few changes, Judes tries to keep the mask on, but Frank forces the mask off of her, watching her drown. It is revealed by Frank that Judes had dived exhausted since they previously had to retrieve the extra tanks, a task Josh didn't do. Unfortunately, they leave the tanks to squeeze into a small cave, leading to disaster. While Josh climbs to the surface with Luko, Liz, and J.D, the cave starts flooding after a huge unforeseen thunderstorm turns into a cyclone, causing flash floods, flooding portions of the cave. Josh decides to go back for the others, which causes problems for them done by the storm. Their attempt to reach the exit for the surface world ends up cut off, leaving them trapped inside below. One by one, the team members die. In the end, Frank and Josh are the only survivors left. Frank is badly injured by Carl who causes him to fall on a Stalagmite, which punctures his back. Josh is then asked by Frank to ease his pain by drowning him. Just as he begins to lose hope, he does find a way out through the cave to open ocean. He is then seen washing up on a beach and discovered by three people fishing on the beach. The end credit paid a tribute to Wesley C. Skiles.
