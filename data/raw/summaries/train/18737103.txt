Bertrand , a film director, is conducting research for his latest film, and asks a funeral director if he can stay back at his funeral parlour after the close of business. Bertrand cannot resist getting into a coffin, and accidentally knocks the lid down, locking himself in the coffin. When Bertrand is released from the coffin in the morning, it is clear he has been profoundly affected by the experience. He considers hiring a prostitute, but cancels after watching a scene from David Cronenberg's film, eXistenZ. He returns to the funeral parlour in the evening, where a strange man breaks into the funeral parlour with him. After asking Bertrand to describe his experience the previous night, the man eventually takes Bertrand to a mansion, headquarters to what appears to be a cult. Although the cult has militaristic aspects, it also seems to be devoted to pleasure. Bertrand is gradually drawn deeper and deeper into the cult.
