A third-generation Ugandan Indian family residing in Kampala, is expelled from the country in 1972 by the Idi Amin regime. The father, Jay  moves with wife, Kinnu  and daughter, Mina  to Greenwood, Mississippi to live with family members who own a chain of motels there. Kinnu obtains work in a liquor store. In 1990, 24-year-old Mina, who cleans at Anil's  family's motel , falls in love with Demetrius , a local African American self-employed carpet cleaner. The respective families erupt in turmoil after the pair are discovered and confronted by members of the Indian family during a clandestine weekend of pleasure in Biloxi. Ultimately, the two families cannot come to terms with the interracial pair, who flee the state together in Demetrius' van. After a brief return to Kampala to attend a court proceeding on the disposition of his confiscated Ugandan house, Jay relinquishes his long-nurtured dream of returning to Uganda, the place he considered home.
