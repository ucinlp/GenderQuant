Madison  and Alex  Stewart are twin sisters from Illinois who are whisked away to Atlantis Resort on Bahamas by their parents for winter break. This was chosen so that the Atlantis Resort could market towards the younger crowd. Initially, the sisters are disappointed that they didn't get to go to Hawaii with their friends, but overcome it by enjoying their newly-earned freedom in the form of their own suite, as well as the pristine beaches of the Caribbean. Alex falls for "hottie" Jordan, a worker at the resort. She's not the only one with her eye on Jordan &ndash; the spoiled heiress Brianna Wallace  is also after him, and plays dirty to get her way. Madison, meanwhile, is being wooed by cute, but brainless, Scott, who in turn is being coached behind the scenes by Griffen, a childhood friend of Madison's with a not-so-subtle crush, to talk to Madison and eventually get her under his thumb. The sisters' holiday of fun in the sun is interrupted when they cross paths with a man smuggling stolen artifacts. Though their parents are keeping a close eye on them, the sisters and Griffen must find a way to clear Jordan's name when their friend is wrongfully arrested for the crime. But only together, they overcome everything and understand the true meaning of sisterhood, along with having a great vacation.
