Michelle Jordan  is a young energetic 8-year-old girl whose mother, Cassy Jordan , goes after man after man, neglecting her child who has never met her father. Searching for love in all the wrong places, Cassy finds a man named Reggie , who seems to be the right man in Michelle and Cassy's life. But four short years later, at the age of 12, Michelle is raped and sexually abused by Reggie. Years later, Michelle , who is now all grown up, is left with bitterness in her heart and leaves home wanting to get away from all of her past memories. Being led astray, Michelle leads a life of stripping, prostitution, and drugs. But when Michelle goes to jail, everything changes and she leaves realizing she has to make a change in her life. On her way to beginning that new life, she runs into an old childhood friend named Todd, who gives her a ride to the halfway house where she will be living with a friend, Nicole, who will help her to get her life back on track. Unfortunately, on her way to starting her life over, she runs into some such familiar roadblocks as Reggie, her mother, and Pervis, her ex-pimp and drug supplier, and she begins to spiral backwards again. This time, though, she is invited to a revival and people like Bishop T.D. Jakes, her godmother Twana, her friend Nicole, and Todd try to help her maintain herself along the right path. But can Michelle give in and forgive the man who molested and raped herâ€”or will she give out and go back to a life of hate and unforgiveness?
