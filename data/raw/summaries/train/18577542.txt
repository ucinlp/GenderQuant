Scant information exists about this high-society drama, a tragic love story which is still missing. Only the second effort from the legendary director Fritz Lang, the film reunites the leads from his debut film Halbblut, with Carl de Vogt playing Vasile Disescu, whose devotion for Yvette  brings about his ruination. Der Herr der Liebe especially tantalizes today because it is also said to feature Lang himself, acting in a supporting role. The film is now considered to be lost.<ref namehttp://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/H/HerrderLiebe1919.html |title2010-12-17|work=Silent Era}}
