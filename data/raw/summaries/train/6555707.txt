Various events involve a dating agency run by Sid Bliss  and his longtime girlfriend Sophie Plummett . Their "Wedded Bliss" agency purports to bring together lonely hearts using computer-matching technology, but couples are actually paired up at random by Sophie. Bliss consistently avoids marrying Sophie, enthusiastically pursuing Esme Crowfoot, a seamstress and client who consistently rejects his advances. Percival Snooper  becomes a client to find a wife for business reasons: as a confirmed bachelor, he's inept at his job as a marriage counselor due to lack of personal experience. James Bedsop ([[Charles Hawtrey  is a private detective Sophie hires to spy on Sid's after-hours activities when he supposedly "vets" the female clients, including Esme. Timid Bertrum Muffet  winds up with model Sally Martin  after the agency muddles his directions to a blind date. Client Terry Philpotts  suffers several failures in his dealings with the agency including a disastrous meeting with prim, sheltered Jenny Grubb . Jenny moves in with Sally, undergoes a makeover, and becomes a model. Terry later finds romance with the "new" Jenny. Percival's association with Sophie provokes his jealous housekeeper, dowdy Miss Dempsey , to reveal her seductive side. Esme's estranged lover, volatile wrestler Gripper Burke , returns to cause havoc in a mistaken-identity case. Peter Butterworth appears in a 1-minute cameo as a Bluebeard-esque character jokingly referred to as Dr. Crippen. He approaches Sid Bliss in order to find his third wife. His first wife died eating poisoned mushrooms, the second suffered a fractured skull because "she wouldn't eat the mushrooms."
