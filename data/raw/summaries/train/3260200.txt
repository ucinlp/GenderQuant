Scrooge  is counting money in the counting house of his firm when Bob Cratchit  comes in, wanting to borrow a lump of coal as he is freezing. Scrooge refuses, and just after this Bugs comes in with Christmas decorations and mistletoe. He is tossed out, and decides that "somebody oughta teach that little humbug some Christmas spirit". Bugs then borrows a piece of coal and places it in the office of Cratchit, who graciously thanks him. However, Sylvester, Scrooge's cat, notices this and warns him, causing him to take back the coal and fire Cratchit, also throwing out some carolers  that Bugs let into his office. Cratchit invites Bugs to dinner introducing him to his youngest son Tiny Tim . "Kinda puny, isn't he?" Bugs notes. "If you had to live on birdseed, you'd be puny too!" Tim retorts. Scrooge sends the light company to take the last candle  and a notice that the house is being foreclosed, forcing Cratchit to move out by midnight. Bugs decides this is the last straw. First, Bugs annoys Scrooge with carolers, causing him to go out to deal with him and he slips. Next, he puts snow into Scrooge's hot bath. He then acts like a ghost dragging around chains and beating a drum, which causes Scrooge to investigate. He does so, and accidentally slips down the stairs and into the cold along with Sylvester. They go back to bed, but Bugs appears acting like a ghost. Sylvester quickly flees, but Scrooge is stopped by the door closing. As the ghost, Bugs threatens to take Scrooge to see "the man in the red suit" . Scrooge quickly promises to change. He immediately makes good on his promise, giving money to the poor and making Bob Cratchit a partner in his firm. Tweety raises a toast to him, and Bugs kisses him. Scrooge  still hates kissing, though. This story is the first part of Bugs Bunny's Looney Christmas Tales. As the second one featuring Wile E. Coyote and Roadrunner begins, Sam asks Cratchit and his family to give all his money back to him.
