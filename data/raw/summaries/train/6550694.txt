Asim Noyan and his gang make up a rambling collective, which concerns itself with a range of criminal activity, running from car theft to fraud. An inveterate womaniser, Asim meets the failed comedian Superman impersonator Samet while fleeing from an angry husband. Desperate Samet finds himself unwittingly implicated in the life of the gang. Meanwhile Umut, the daughter of Mr and Mrs Ocak, a highly literate but hard up couple, leads an altogether different life. The ways of Samet and Umut and Asim's gang clash around a stolen car.
