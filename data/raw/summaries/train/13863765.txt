The film tells the story of the Turkish warlord İslam Bey, portrayed by Cüneyt Arkın. İslam Bey sneaks into a Russian castle where the plans of a Russian attack on Ottoman territory is being planned. He presents himself as a Russian prince to the commander of the castle and tries to slow down the war preparations of the Russian side while the Ottoman forces are waiting reinforcement. In one scene İslam Bey orders the Russian commander to wait until the arrival of the "Kiev Imperial Army" to attack the Turks. İslam Bey uses his sword on the portrait of the Tsar and cuts the portrait when he finishes his speech. The portrait he attacked clearly belongs to the last Tsar of the Russian Empire, Nicholas II.
