Samuel L. Jackson narrates the story about a group of male penguins that make a 70-mile trek to go to their breeding grounds where females are waiting to have sex with them. These penguins include Carl  and Jimmy , two friends who talk about relationships and other things as they meet new characters including Marcus , a penguin who likes to kid around and brag about his huge penis , and Steve the snowy owl , who gives Carl advice on his life in a Freudian kind of way while billing him for the two quick sessions. Meanwhile, Melissa  and Vicky  argue about men and other women who bother them as they wait for their mates to arrive at the breeding grounds.
