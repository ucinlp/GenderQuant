The film has several plot lines, one each for Ralphie, his father and his mother, followed by one involving Ralphie and his dad on a fishing trip. Ralphie's quest for most of the movie is to find a top tough enough to knock a bully's top out of a chalk circle in a game of "Kill." Meanwhile, the Old Man has a series of skirmishes with his hillbilly neighbors, the Bumpuses, and all forty-three Bloodhounds named Big Red. The Old Man calls in Barkley, the family dog, to distract the Bumpuses' hounds when the Old Man comes home from work; when he gets out of the car, he accidentally steps in dog poop. Ralphie's mom would like to finally get something other than a Ronald Colman gravy boat on dish night at the local cinema. Scut the main Bully is demoted down with a new head bully ruling over him. When Ralphie does get a superior Top just as powerful as the Bully's and both Tops go at it, ending up with both of them disappearing into the sewer never to be seen again.
