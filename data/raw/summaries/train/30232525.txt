In the city, Soman is hit by a car driven by a rich young woman who takes him home and also employs him as the manager of her estate.

Meanwhile Lakshmi leaves the village in search of Soman. During her wanderings Lakshmi sees her husband with a woman and suspects him of being disloyal. The young woman is none other than his employer. Lakshmi tries to kill her child and commit suicide but what saves her is the instinct of motherhood.
