Valentino plays Count Rodrigo Torriani, an Italian noble. A charming libertine, his weakness is women--the "cobras" referred to in the title of the film. Roridgo accepts an invitation from friend Jack Dorning  to come to New York City to work as an antiques expert. While the job is rewarding, Rodrigo finds the temptation from the women surrounding him, including Dorning's secretary Mary Drake  and wife Elise  challenging.  When Jack is away, Elise reveals to Rodrigo that she is still in love with him. The two arrange to meet at a hotel. However, at the last minute, Rodrigo remembers he cannot betray his friend and refuses to go to the rendezvous. It turns out to be a wise decision; the hotel burns to the ground in the middle of the night, killing Elise. Rodrigo desperately wants a relationship with Mary. However, after Elise's death, he turns Mary's attentions toward Jack and decides to leave New York. The film ends with Rodrigo gazing out at the sea and the Statue of Liberty as he sets sail back to Europe. The production of Cobra was marred by bickering and soaring production costs. Furthermore, its studio Paramount Pictures, unhappy with the final film and fearing it would flop with audiences and critics, held off releasing it until Valentino  appeared in a stronger, unequivocally successful picture. Eventually Cobra was released in late 1925, a few weeks after what proved to be Valentino's comeback feature, The Eagle. Cobra has survived and has been made available to the public, on both VHS and DVD, by independent film dealers and major movie distributors.
