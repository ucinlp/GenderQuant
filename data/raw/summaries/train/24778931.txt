From the director of La mujer de mi hermano and the writer of Voces Inocentes comes Mancora, a tender and pulsating road-trip drama that delicately traces the shifting emotional boundaries between three disconnected souls. Mancora introduces us to Santiago ([[Jason Day , a 21-year old from Lima who is haunted by his father’s recent and unexpected suicide. Suffocating in the chill of a grey Lima winter, Santiago decides to take refuge in MÁNCORA, a beach town in the north of the country where summer never ends. Right before his departure, Santiago receives an unexpected visit from his stepsister Ximena , a vibrant, sexy Spanish photographer and her husband Iñigo , a brash art-collector from New York. The tranquility of their getaway is quickly shattered by a powerful act of boundary-crossing and betrayal, which threatens to transform their relationship forever and turn Máncora into a paradise lost.
