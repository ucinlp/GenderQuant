The story is a combination of Parijatapaharanam, Subhadra Parinayam and Gayopakhyanam sequences in Hindu epic Mahabharata. Parijat flower bought from Heaven by Narada is gifted to Sri Krishna, who in turn gives it to Rukmini. Satyabhama, learning this, gets angry upon Krishna and hits him with her foot. He begs her pardon for seeking affection. Subhadra is Sri Krishna's sister. Arjuna, in guise of a Munishwar, goes to Dwaraka and with Krishna's help comes close to Subhadra and finally marries her. Gayopakhyanam was a popular play written by Chilakamarthi Lakshmi Narasimham. Krishna and Arjuna fight for the life of Gaya, a Gandharva king, accidentally spitting into Sri Krishna's palms. Finally Lord Shiva averts war and resulting mass destruction.
