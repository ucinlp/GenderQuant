Godavari is a film about Ram, Seetha and the river cruise that brings them together. Its a semi-urban love story set against the scenic backdrop of the Godavari river aboard a houseboat also called the “Godavari”. Its a story about Ram and Seetha who decide to take a break from their disappointing lives in the city. They leave behind their personal and professional problems and decide to take a cruise on the river, Godavari, from Rajamundry to Badrachalam. They meet aboard the cruise liner and from there starts a story involving friendship, adventure, and eventually love. The story also reflects the characteristic culture of the Godavari region. There are also several sub stories involving the other characters on the house boat. Ram  is an idealistic man. He wishes to make a career in politics even though he’s actually a software engineer with a degree from the USA. He lives with his grandmother in a middle class colony. He's in love with his cousin, Raji, whom he hopes to marry someday. However Raji declines Ram's proposal as she's insecure about his professional and financial future. A heartbroken but realistic Ram is forced to join her and his family on the river journey to Badrachalam, where Raji is due to get married to another man, Ravi. Ravi unlike Ram is a rich guy and also an IPS recruit. Seetha  runs an unsuccessful clothing boutique. Her parents want her to forget about her business and tell her to get married instead. Seetha is not enthusiastic about the idea, however circumstances force her to reluctantly agree with her parents. Unfortunately, the marriage alliance doesn’t work out for her and she subsequently choses to take a break from everything by going on the same Godavari river journey. How Ram and Sita fall in love forms the rest of the story. The animated dog  and parrot also have their significant roles in the movie. The treasure hunt scenes are fun to watch.
