The Pink Panther wants to become a toreador, but a swarm of moths eat his cloak. Then when he gives up, he sees Marvelo the Magician. The Panther borrows Marvelo's cloak, and has trouble with outsmarting the bull, and a crabby magic rabbit inside the cape. The panther splits him in two. When the bull runs in the cape, the rabbit leaves the cape, and the bull gets his behind back. Then the swarm of moths return, and eat Pink Panther's cape, making it spell "THE END"
