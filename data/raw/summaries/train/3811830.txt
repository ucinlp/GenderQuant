 Aditya , an automobile engineer, is as passionate about cars as Shakespeare was about writing. Not only is he an engineer, he is also a test driver for the company. Aditya is engaged to Sonia , a fashion designer about to make her mark. Aditya and Sonia are not on the same wavelength; Sonia is a 21st century modern woman for whom career comes first. As much as Aditya tries to overlook these facts, they keep coming in the way of their relationship. The marriage date is fixed, and Aditya has to leave for Canada to learn about a new car model to be launched in India. Meanwhile, Sonia leaves to Paris for a fashion show. Aditya arrives in Canada and meets his sister Simran  and her husband and son, who all live in Canada. Destiny makes Aditya continually bump into Jia , daughter of business tycoon Yashwardhan Birla. She has come to Canada alone to shop for her wedding with the business giant Karan Oberoi . She is a simple girl with a thirst for true love. She had everything she could ask for in her childhood but never time from her ever-so-busy father. Now, the man her father has chosen for her hardly has any time for her either. She finds a friend in Aditya, and as the two spend time together, their friendship grows. Aditya gets a chance from the company to participate in a car rally. He persuades Jia to participate with him and they win. On returning from the rally, their car gets stuck in the snow and they have to spend the night together. They share intimate moments, which make them forget that they are engaged to others. Soon, they realize they are falling in love. When Jia tells Aditya that she believes her father is responsible for her mother's death, Aditya tells this to his best friend and roommate, Nawab. On a drunken night, Nawab tells his other friend, who is a reporter. The reporter then publishes this in the newspaper. Jia, extremely hurt, returns to India to marry Karan. Aditya also returns to India to get married to Sonia, and does not attempt to meet Jia. Sonia turns out to be the designer for Jia's wedding. Mr Oberoi asks Aditya to come to the wedding, and Sonia persuades him to attend. Jia's friend and Karan's secretary, Jenny, bumps into Nawab, who reveals that it was his fault that Jia's secret was published in the papers. But it is too lateâ€”the wedding ceremony is over and Jia and Karan are married. Jia then goes to meet Aditya to apolgize. They confess their love for each other, but agree never to meet again. However, Karan catches them talking, and questions Jia. She says that she only loves Karan and Aditya is just a good friend. When Aditya leaves the wedding, he finds an upside-down car, which Jia is in after an accident. As petrol leaks, Aditya goes into the car to help Jia. The car catches fire, just as Aditya manages to free her. He helps her out of the car, while the press and public gather around. He accompanies Jia to Karan, telling him that Jia only belongs to him. However, Karan has a change of heart and pulls Jia's mangalsutra off, telling her to marry Aditya. Aditya's engagement with Sonia is also broken, and he and Jia hug, finally united.
