Set in early 18th century England, a mysterious stranger, calling himself Dante, arrives in a remote village populated by highwaymen, whores and lowlifes. He offers payment for certain "papers" from Lord Faversham. Soon after, another stranger arrives - an attractive girl named Rossetti - looking for Dante. Neither she, nor Dante, are what they seem. Gabriel, now caught between the two of them, quickly discovers his world is about to end as the Devil's work begins.
