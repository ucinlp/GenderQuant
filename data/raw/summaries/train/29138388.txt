Chorus girls Irene and Joan are discussing the war in their dressing room. Joan flicks through a copy of Picture Post with "Your Country Needs You" on the cover, and says she doesn't think she'd be cut out for war work and doesn't like being made to feel guilty about not volunteering. Irene says she has been thinking about it. As they leave by the stage door, a woman faints on the pavement in front of them. A newspaper seller says that the woman has just finished a 12 hour shift in a munitions factory and is exhausted, and that such long hours are necessary because of the shortage of workers. Irene is spurred to offer to work in munitions and is seen on her first shift being shown the ropes. When she gets home to the flat she shares with Joan, she immediately falls asleep. On her next shift she learns that a co-worker has just been given the news that her son is missing in action. As she comes off her shift, she finds Joan in the changing room, having just volunteered herself. An urgent message comes through that extra bullets are required. Rather than going home to sleep, Irene turns round and goes back to work with Joan.
