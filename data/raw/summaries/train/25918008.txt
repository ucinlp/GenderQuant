The Geotech Company has set up a large Antarctic base to drill for oil. The facility is staffed by Dr. Monica Kelsey , Nelson Schneider  and six workers. During a raging storm, a research team arrives by helicopter, forced to land due to an even worse storm approaching, sent by Geotech to investigate the death of a worker named Lenny , the disappearance of workers Carl and Lippski, and mysterious tremors hitting the area, hoping to learn the cause of these events before the arrival of a United Nations investigation team who might shut down the base. The team's leader, Professor Ted Jacobson  has romantic ties to Dr. Kelsey. The rest of his team are four post grad students: Arianna , Tom , Update , and Curtis . A giant black trilobite makes its appearance and attacks Dr. Kelsey. One by one, the rest get picked off by the monster.
