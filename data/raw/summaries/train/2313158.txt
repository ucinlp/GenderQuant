Cathy Timberlake, a New York City career woman, meets the man of her dreams, Philip Shayne, in an unusual way. His Rolls Royce splashes her dress with mud while she is on her way to a job interview. The wealthy, suave Philip and the virginal Cathy are at cross purposes. He just wants an affair, while she is holding out for marriage. Watching from the sidelines are Philip's conflicted assistant, Roger, who is guilt-ridden and seeing a therapist for helping his boss with his numerous conquests, and Cathy's cynical friend, Connie Emerson, who knows just what Philip is after.  Philip wines and dines Cathy. He even takes her to see the New York Yankees play. They watch from an unusual vantage point, the Yankees dugout . Cathy's complaints about the umpire while seated alongside Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris and Yogi Berra , cause ump Art Passarella to throw all of them out of the game. Philip's conscience weighs on him, so he withdraws an invitation to Bermuda, which only serves to make Cathy succumb and agree to go. This implicitly consents to intimacy. But conveniently or not , she comes down with a possibly psychosomatic rash, much to her embarrassment and his frustration. The Bermuda trip is repeated due to Cathy's determination to give it a second try, but this time she drinks to soothe her nerves and ends up tipsy. Cathy makes a complete fool of herself, eventually falling out of the window onto an awning below. Cathy's humiliation is rendered complete as she is carried in her pajamas through the crowded hotel lobby. At the urging of Roger and Connie, now convinced that Philip is in love with her, Cathy goes on a date with the sleazy Beasley to make her true love jealous. Her plan succeeds and they do get married. Ironically, on their honeymoon, he breaks out in a rash.
