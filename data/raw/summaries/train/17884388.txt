The movie follows the same plot as Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives. Set in contemporary Mumbai, the movie takes a close look at the evolving equations among urban couples and paints the metamorphosis amongst the relationships with a comic stroke. The film tracks the lives of two modern-day married couples &mdash; Samit  and Mita ; Rishi  and Simi  &mdash; caught in web of boredom, loss of love and temptation. The film starts with an announcement by Samit and Mita of their separation and follows the moral muddles and emotional crises of the couples over the next year and a half &mdash; as friends fight, separate, take lovers and, in a way, reconcile.
