Donald Brocklebank  is a man of aristocratic background living in fear of bankruptcy in a country manor house. His wife, Nancy , is terminally ill and requires constant care, as does his schizophrenic son James . When Donald leaves the two alone in a bid to solve their almost definite financial collapse, James's condition begins to worsen, believing he is able to look after his sick mother rather than nurse Mary  who was sent by Donald. He neglects taking his prescribed medicine and locks the nurse out of the house, leaving his mother with nothing to do but weep. James, believing that more medicine will make you better faster than the prescribed amount, force feeds his mother large quantities of her pills, nearly killing her. Eventually, police make their way into the house, relieving Nancy of her son's care. Due to the medication overdose she has an emergency operation which seems to cure her of her previous ailments. James then goes on to begin hallucinating from not taking his medication, while Nancy recovers from her illness. In a fit of rage, James stabs his own mother to death, before stabbing and wounding his father. Shortly before Nancy's funeral, Donald passionately supports his son, provoking hostility from the rest of the family. At the funeral itself, James believes he has seen his mother and rushes over to hug her. In James' eyes, she then stabs her son several times, though everyone else sees James taking the knife he killed his mother with into his own stomach. The film ends with Donald apparently bearing the same condition as his son, being cared for in his own home. He stabs one of the nurses, and is taken away.
