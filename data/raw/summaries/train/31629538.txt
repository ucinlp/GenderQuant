The story follows Sid  and Adi , roommates and good friends. Adi is a struggling actor, whilst Sid is a struggling DJ who admires his own dog Suckru  more than himself. Adi falls in love with Simran  who works at a call-center, and Sid falls for Anu  whom he meets at a fashion show, which Adi and Sid sneak into. Then Anu and Simran go to Goa to meet Anu's father, Marlo . In Goa, Baba 3G , a conman posing as a priest tells Marlo that his dead mother has been reincarnated into a female dog. When Adi and Sid take Suckru and follow the girls to Goa and meet Marlo, Suckru copulates with the dog. Marlo begins to believe Suckru is his late father and Sid is hilariously chased by Marlo several times who is trying to get his hands on Suckru. The film then takes a hilarious turn filled with dirtiness and mayhem in which, soon enough, Suckru takes matters into his own hands.
