The plot revolves around a group of high school cheerleaders who have sex with the opposing team's players to make them too tired to play football properly, allowing their team to win an unprecedented series of games. The movie courted controversy at the time of release due to essentially revolving around very sexually active schoolgirls, with the titular cheerleaders seducing, amongst others - the football coach, a female gym coach, and the school bus driver. There was also female on male rape when the cheerleaders kidnap and then have sex with the members of the opposing football team the night before the big game. In areas where the age of consent was 18 at the time, or where the laws on consent prohibited under-18s having sex with over-18s, there was controversy over statutory rape. However, re-releases of the movie have been renamed as "The Eighteen Year Old Schoolgirls" in some regions, presumably so as to remove at least part of that particular controversy, as the exact age of the girls was never stated within the movie.
