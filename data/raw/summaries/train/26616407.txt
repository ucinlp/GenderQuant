Sheldon  rides the bus home from work in Los Angeles. He says hello to his neighbors before entering his apartment. Inside, he drums his fingers on a counter, observing the sparse interior. Then he recharges himself. The next day, he is shown working as a library shelver. As he waits for the bus, he sees Francesca  driving a car, making eye contact with her. A human woman reprimands Francesca for driving a car, saying that she is 'not allowed'. He sees Francesca at the bus stop once more, this time with a car full of passengers. Francesca turns the car around and convinces Sheldon to let her give him a ride home. The group ends up at a shopping mall, hanging out in the parking lot. Francesca and Sheldon walk off together, and Francesca falls, injuring her knee. Sheldon repairs her knee with his toolkit. They begin to date. At night, they sleep together, sharing the same recharging cable. Francesca tells Sheldon about her dreams, which he thought was clearly impossible for robots. At a rock club, Francesca's arm is detached while she dances. Sheldon fixes it by transplanting his arm. Later, she stumbles home without a leg. Sheldon transplants his leg, despite Francesca's protests, telling her that he had a dream about it. Finally, he gets a phone call summoning him to the hospital, where Francesca lies on an operating table, torn in two. Sheldon donates the rest of his body to her, leaving only his still functioning head. Francesca is discharged from the hospital in a wheelchair, cradling Sheldon in her lap.
