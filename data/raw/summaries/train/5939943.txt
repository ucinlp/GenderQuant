Failing UHF TV station KRUD, Channel 17, is "reborn" as Christian television station KGOD. The new format is a big success but attracts an incompatible mix of fringe ministries and broadcasters wanting time on the station. A series of humorous vignettes show the different religious shows the station broadcasts: a faith healer, a radical black nationalist preacher, a preacher with a drive-in church, a Christian game show, etc. The film is very similar in both plot and style to the film UHF which was released in 1989.David Nusair, "Six Comedy Cult Classics from MGM", reelfilm.com, November 2005Scott Weinberg, "Pray TV", DVD Talk, November 15, 2005
