After many attempts to destroy Grendizer and conquer earth, the King Vega sends General Barendos and his troops in a special mission. Before landing, Barendos stops at moonbase and warns the two officials that, in case of his success, they will be both dismissed and killed. This situation explains why during the movie, Barendos doesn't receive support from Vega forces on moonbase. Barendos arrives on earth and captures Duke Fleed's closest ally, Koji Kabuto. While under a mind control in captivity, Koji reveals the history and location of both Mazinger Z and Great Mazinger. The Vega Empire seized the opportunity to capture the Great Mazinger and forcing Duke and his Grendizer to do battle against the formidable Great Mazinger. Grendizer and Great Mazinger clash in battle until Grendizer manages to deactivate Great Mazinger using a special shot, suggested by Koji. Also starring in this movie are three exclusive saucer beasts named Jinjin, Gubigubi, and Koakoa that also battle Grendizer only to be easily defeated. The Movie is based on several ideas featured in UFO Robo Grendizer Manga by Go Nagai, Especially from Chapter 5. Captain Barandos made an appearance and stole Great Mazinger from it's hangar, and used it to fight Grendizer with the help of 3 other saucer beasts, similar to the movie. Also, in the Chapter 4 of the manga Mazinger Z and Great Mazinger have been stolen to fight Grendizer together, which Grendizer had tough time fighting both. {{Expand section}}
