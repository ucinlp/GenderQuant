Marie  is a very appealing modern-day vampire in Pittsburgh, with a moral code that limits her bloodsucking to the criminal elements of society. However, when she feasts on a vicious gang boss, Salvatore 'The Shark' Macelli , and fails to complete the job properly - by not severing his spinal cord, he, too, becomes one of the undead and begins to pass his newfound powers on to his henchmen. With the help  of undercover cop Joseph Gennaro , Marie sets out to put things right.
