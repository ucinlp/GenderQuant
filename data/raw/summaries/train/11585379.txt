While Holloway's mentor, General William Jacobs , keeps FBI agents Lock  and Load  from snooping into his pet project, Holloway and Sparks enjoy some R&R with Holloway's wife Jessica  and daughter Nicole . It turns out Lucas is an operative for an intra-military right-wing group and, temporarily assuming Holloway's identity, he steals the Phoenix.

After he touches base with his family, extremist soldiers shoot Jessica and later kidnap Nicole.

Jacobs tells Holloway that if he ever wants to see Nicole alive again, Holloway must bomb the White House.
