The short begins by showing a map of Music Land, before zooming in to show the Land of Symphony. The Land of Symphony is a classical-themed kingdom, where the princess  grows bored with the slow ballroom dancing and sneaks out. Across the Sea of Discord, the Isle of Jazz is alive with hot music and dancing, but the prince  takes little interest in it. Sneaking out, he spots the princess across the sea with the aid of a clarinet-telescope. He quickly traverses the sea on a xylophone boat to meet her. Their flirting is interrupted, however, when the queen  of the Land of Symphony sends her guards to lock him in a metronome prison tower. To escape this predicament, he writes a note for help  and passes it to a bird, which brings it to his father , who raises the battle cry (a jazz version of the military [[Assembly . The Isle of Jazz deploys its multi-piece band as artillery, bombarding the Land of Symphony with explosive musical notes to a jazz/swing number. The Land of Symphony returns fire via organ pipes that rotate into cannons, launching volleys to the refrains of Wagner's The Ride of the Valkyries. The princess intervenes to stop the war, but falls into the sea. The prince struggles to escape his cell, but an explosive note helps him via landing next to it and blowing it up, and he rushes to save her, but ends up struggling as well. Both parents see what is happening, and quickly cease fire to rescue their children. The story ends on a happy note with a double marriage, as the citizens of both lands dance on the newly-built Bridge of Harmony.
