A skydiving team called the Gypsy Moths visits a small town in Kansas to put on a show: the leader is Mike Rettig , accompanied by his partners, Joe Browdy  and Malcolm Webson ([[Scott Wilson . The skydivers stay at the home of Malcolm's uncle and aunt, John and Elizabeth Brandon ([[William Windom . The distractions begin almost immediately. Mike becomes romantically involved with Elizabeth, whose husband overhears her making love with Mike in their home. Malcolm falls for local student Annie Burke , a boarder in the Brandon house. Joe takes an interest in a topless dancer. Mike eventually asks Elizabeth to leave town with him, but she declines. During the next skydiving exhibition, Mike intends to do a spectacular "cape jump" stunt but his rip cord fails to open. Before the team leaves for good, Malcolm is determined to try the cape jump himself.
