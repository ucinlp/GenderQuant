The movie itself is presented as being a trailer for a 9 hours long movie. It starts with a voice-over, telling the viewer that: "some murders take seconds; some murders take minutes; some murders take hours; this murder... will take years!". Then the movie starts to show the story of a forensic pathologist called Jack Cucchiaio , who finds himself being haunted by a deranged looking man , who is, without any clear reason, hitting him with a spoon. No-one seems to believe this, however, since the mysterious attacker shows only up when Jack is alone. Jack is seen developing a phobia of spoons, stirring his coffee with a fork. At one moment, Jack tries to defend himself with violence, stabbing the murderer in the throat with a kitchen knife. To Jack's surprise, his enemy turns out to be immortal, pulling the knife out of his throat and throwing it away, in order to continue hitting Jack with the spoon. However, Jack has noticed a strange sign on the arm of his attacker. Jack travels to the far east, where he learns that his attacker is known as the Ginosaji , an immortal, unstoppable being. After this, Jack is shown traveling around the world, trying to escape from the Ginosaji, or to fight it. He uses various weapons, including dynamite, guns, and an RPG. Since the Ginosaji is immortal, however, he will always survive and find Jack again. The last scene shows a weakened, wounded Jack, crawling on the ground of a desert, with the Ginosaji still hitting him. Then, suddenly, the spoon of the Ginosaji breaks. However, just when it seems that there is any hope for Jack, the Ginosaji opens his jacket and shows dozens of spoons, from which he takes one after which he resumes hitting Jack. Finally, the title and credits are shown, in typical trailer style.
