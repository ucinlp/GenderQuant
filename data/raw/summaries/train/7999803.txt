The title refers to a jigsaw puzzle and the story begins with the murder of a print shop owner that is quickly labeled a suicide. But newspaper columnist Charlie Riggs is convinced that it was a murder related to a white neo-fascist organization called the Crusaders and imparts this suspicion to Assistant District Attorney Howard Malloy. He also publishes this opinion in his column. Then Riggs himself is murdered, inducing Malloy to launch an investigation into the Crusaders. Because the group appears to be getting backing from organized crime, Malloy looks there, soon receiving unasked-for help from a crime boss called “Angel,” who recommends him for the position of special prosecutor. Later, with further help from a prominent judge’s widow, Malloy is appointed. This is supposed to put him in the pocket of those behind the murders. But Malloy proceeds to investigate the artist who created the Crusaders recruiting poster. Seeing in the artist's studio a painting of an attractive night club singer, Malloy then proceeds to investigate her. This leads to a series of revelations regarding all of these characters and ends with more people dead and wounded in a fiery exchange at the end. This film has been called a grade B mystery thriller and social problem movie rather than a noir, but it has a number of noir characteristics, such as an unsentimental approach to crime, a plot centered on murder, a focus on social outsiders, a critical femme fatale character, and lighting dominated by darkness and deep shadows. It was later re-released as Gun Moll.
