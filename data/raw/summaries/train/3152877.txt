Overworked air-traffic controller Jack Chester takes his wife Sandy and children Jennifer, Bobby and Laurie on a summer vacation from the Atlanta area to fictitious Citrus Cove, Florida, during which they are constantly beset by a never-ending barrage of problems. First they move into the wrong house by mistake, then Jack receives a leg injury that prevents him from being able to spend time with his family. The family ends up in a fairly decrepit shack on a public beach in Florida, with a constant stream of vacationers tromping through. Jack locks horns with pompous local sailing champion Al Pellet, the owner of this dubious piece of real estate. About to be evicted early, Jack proposes a wager -- if he can win this year's regatta, Al must allow the Chesters to stay rent-free. The trouble is, Jack hasn't sailed for many years and he doesn't even have a boat. Scully, a local saloon keeper with a pirate's mentality, befriends Jack and volunteers to help him on both counts. The bored Chesters come to life by helping Jack make his new vessel seaworthy. This motley crew is at first glance no match for Al or anybody else in the race, but a strong breeze and a large pair of pants enable Jack to enjoy a victory at sea.
