With a little humorous approach, the film explores human advances in the field of sciences. Both Apted and Paul G. Allen, director and film financer respectively, deploy segments of interviews with several scientists and researchers about their views in science, in the same way they previously did with arts in the documentary Inspirations. People that are featured in the film are: *Gertrude Elion. *Ashok Gadgil. *Michio Kaku. *Maja Mataric. *Steven Pinker. *Karol Sikora. *Patricia Wright.
