A Royal Air Force  airman who dies during a mission has left a letter to be sent to his mother upon his death. This film shows that letter being delivered to his mother. As the letter is read out by John Gielgud in a voiceover, we see the mother in the airman's room, looking through his things and remembering him as a youth. The letter tells of his reasons for joining the armed forces and going to fight, knowing full well that he could die.
