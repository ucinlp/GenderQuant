At a bistro, Oswald works as the chef while the girl beagle serves as the waitress. Their first patron is a tall terrier who came in for spaghetti. After finishing his meal, he slowly walks toward the cash register, pretending he would pay his bill. The tall terrier discloses that he has nothing to pay as he quickly exits the door and gives the bistro operators a raspberry. Nevertheless, Oswald and the girl beagle just laughed, knowing they can prevent other customers from running off. Coming in next is the boy beagle with an appetite for pancakes. As he receives his order and tries to take a nibble, the boy beagle finds the pancakes rock solid and therefore too hard to chew on, much to his disgust. He then starts tossing them around, prompting Oswald to tell him that such actions come at a price. Refusing to give a cent, the boy beagle heads toward the door. Before he could do so, however, he was nabbed by the robotic cash register that shakes off every single coin he has. The third customer is a big bear who preferred for a ham sandwich. While Oswald is in the kitchen, the bear started flirting the girl beagle, and Oswald was aware of it. Irritated by that, Oswald saws out of two square wooden boards and glues them in between. The bear then receives and takes a bite of the false sandwich, thus resulting in cracked and chipped teeth. Provoked, the bear goes into a frenzy. Oswald, however, was able to evade and fend off the bear's aggression. Upon bringing their unruly client down, Oswald the girl beagle put corn kernels plus a lighted oil lamp in the bear's trousers. The corn started popping inside and the bear runs away hysterically. The cartoon concludes with Oswald singing in baritone next to his colleague which he also did in the beginning.
