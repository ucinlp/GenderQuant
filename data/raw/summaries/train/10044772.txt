The film tells of a Ringo , a young man who moves from the city to the country, and moves in with his cousin Nancy . He takes a job as a Pin Boy at the local bowling alley. Ringo is has to go through to a rather physical and extensive training session, and is warned that the job is physically demanding and hazardous and he is given no health insurance. But Ringo takes the job with enthusiasm and seems content doing the physical work. He listens to the folktales of his older, more experienced co-workers, particularly the well-traveled former hippie who calls himself Nippur. Ringo comes home from work as Nancy goes out to her job, and they share breakfast before she leaves. They establish a good relationship that develops into a good friendship.
