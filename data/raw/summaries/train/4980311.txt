Indu  and DK  have a happy marriage and two daughters &mdash; Pinky and Minni. The tranquility of their life is shattered when DK receives word that he has a son from a short-term affair with Bhavana  during his visit to Nainital when his wife Indu was about to give birth to their first child Pinky. Bhavana did not tell DK about this since she did not want to disturb his life. Now that she is dead, her guardian Masterji sends word to DK in Delhi saying that the boy, Rahul , who is eight years old, needs a home. Despite the objections of Indu, who is devastated to learn of her husband's infedility, the boy comes to stay with them in Delhi for some time. Rahul is never told that DK is his father. Rahul bonds with DK and his daughters. But Indu can't bear to look at him, who is a tangible reminder of DK's betrayal. DK, worried by the effect that Rahul is having on his family, decides to put him in a boarding school in St. Joseph's College, Nainital; Rahul accepts with reluctance. After gaining admission at the school and returning to Delhi before his permanent move to Nainital, Rahul figures out that DK is his father and runs away from home. After he is escorted home by a police officer, Rahul confesses his awareness of the identity of his father to Indu. Indu is unable to bear the heartbreak of the young child and intercepts Rahul before he is put onto the train to Nainital, thereby accepting him into the family and wholeheartedly forgiving DK.
