Following the divorce of her parents, Marcia and Larry Carter , sixteen year old Zoey Carter  begins to experiment with drugs. For example she steals prescription medicine from her mother. From her parents' perspective, Zoey appears to be well-adjusted and mature. She, however, obtains drugs from local dealers and uses this is as a coping mechanism. At first, her parents appear to be clueless as to the fact that Zoey has a problem with drugs. Zoey is able to deceive her parents. For example, when her parents find her passed out in the backseat of her car, she defends herself by claiming that she just crawled into the backseat and fell asleep. Her secret behavior goes unnoticed at first, as her good grades and volunteer work make her appear to be a model teenager. Zoey escalates to stealing cash in order to buy pills and marijuana. Her drug dealer, older student Ron Morris  gives her drugs to increase her addiction and encourages her to shoplift to buy more. Zoey's addiction is discovered when her mother finds a stash of pills in her backpack after a drug-induced fainting episode. Zoey is sent to drug rehab. Her first stint there gives only the appearance of success, as Zoey continues her secret behavior. After an overdose, Zoey returns to rehab, where her counselor Mike Harper  works with her parents to help Zoey break free of her addiction.
