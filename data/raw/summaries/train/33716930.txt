Following the death of her fiancÃ©, Margot Weston  is left pregnant and unmarried. A former doctor Jim Howard  helps the desperate Margot. When her son is born, Jim helps her find a home for the baby with Phil Marshall  and his wife. Margot insists that neither the Marshalls nor the child can ever know that she is his mother. Five years later, while working as a well-paid buyer for the store owned by Harriet Martin , Margot meets Jim Howard again, and the two begin to fall in love. When Margot is sent to Europe on a business trip for Harriet, she meets and is wooed by the charming but carefree Count Giovanni Corini . While in Paris, she happens to meet her son Roddy , who is traveling with his aunt, who has been taking care of the boy since his adoptive mother died. On the trip back to America, Margot and Roddy become close. Count Corini is also on the same ship, and he continues to pursue Margot. Back home, Margot becomes convinced that Jessica , Phil Marshall's new fiancee, doesn't love him, and would be a bad mother to Roddy. Margot decides to break up the engagement, but Jim, beginning a career as a scientist, reminds her of her earlier promise not to interfere in the boy's life.{{cite web|lastBill|titlehttp://movies.nytimes.com/movie/123408/Always-Goodbye/overview The New York Times|accessdate"films">{{cite web}}
