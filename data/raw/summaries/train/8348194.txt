Based in the days of the Bulgarian Resistance during Second World War the film deals with a young anti-fascist underground group combat operating in Sofia. Veska and Dimo are central characters. Their love affair ends because they are apprehended by the police and jailed. Veska is tortured to death and Dimo is burnt alive cruelly. The little photographer girl, Tzveteto, also meets with a violent death, as do all other members of the group. Soon afterwards another group of courageous youth is being formed. Some of them will perhaps not live to enjoy their youth.
