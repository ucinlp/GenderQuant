However, her investigation brings her face to face with a difficult emotional and ethical decision. She wants to get higher up in the agency with this, the agency’s most important case, but she falls in love with Manuel, one of the key members she is investigating. Her professional ethics and her amorous feelings for Manuel turn her life into turmoil not knowing what to do.

When a mysterious woman called Marta appears in Iñaki’s life, Eva starts an investigation into her spouse’s secret life stumbling upon the possibility that her husband may not only be having an affair but leading a double life with another wife and family.
