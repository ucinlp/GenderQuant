The film is set over the course of a New Year's Eve night in the Croatian port city of Split, where it follows three parallel plots. The first plot line features a small-time drug dealer Nike  and a young widow Marija ; the second plot line deals with a drug addict called Maja  who decides to have sex with an US Navy sailor called Franky  in exchange for some heroin; the third one shows a young couple, Luka and AnÄ‘ela  who spend the night desperately looking for a place to celebrate the New Year by having their first sexual experience. The plots are connected through Dino Dvornik's concert, where all of them pass through at some point, and through the omnipresent fireworks that dot the night sky over the course of the film.
