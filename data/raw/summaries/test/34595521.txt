In 1984, 14-year-old Donny Berger has an affair with his 22-year-old teacher, Mary McGarricle. They are caught having sex, and Mary is arrested. She is pregnant, and Donny names the kid Han Solo Berger; Donny becomes a celebrity because of what has happened, but is forgotten as he grows up and loses contact with his son. 2012, Donny is a 42-year-old slacker who has squandered all his money. He drinks beer constantly, and spends his time at a local strip club with his friends, bartender Brie and stripper Champale. Donny's son no longer speaks to or associates with him. Angry about Donny's incompetence as a father, he tells acquaintances that his parents died in an explosion when he was nine years old, has gone on to become a successful businessman, has lost a lot of weight and is no longer the obese child that Donny knows, and is about to marry a rich young woman named Jamie. Han has arrived at the Cape Cod house of his boss, Steve Spirou, the site of the wedding; while he doesn't get along well with Jamie's brother Chad, a Marine he has just met for the first time, he is well liked by the other guests. Donny learns that he owes $43,000 to the IRS in back-taxes and will be imprisoned for three years if he doesn't repay the money by the end of the weekend. He places a long-odds wager on morbidly obese athlete Tubby Tuke to win an upcoming marathon, but realizes that he needs another plan. He visits TV producer Randall Morgan, who had produced shows for Donny during his brief period of celebrity, and Morgan offers him $50,000 if he can organize a reunion with Han and Ms. McGarricle at the women's prison. Donny arrives at Cape Cod to try to convince Han to participate. Because he had previously told people that his parents had died, Han introduces Donny as an old friend; Donny elaborates with a heroic backstory and, despite his extremely crude behavior, quickly becomes well-liked by the other guests, at the expense of Han's popularity – to the point where Han's best man, co-worker Phil, passes the role of best man on to Donny. Donny tries to convince Han to come to the women's prison to see Ms. McGarricle , but Han fights constantly with Donny about his father's immaturity, both now and during his childhood, even revealing that he has type 2 diabetes due to Donny allowing him to eat whatever he wanted when he was a child. When Donny later hears Jamie yelling at Han, he tries to be fatherly by encouraging him to stand up for himself; he follows this advice the next day at the wedding rehearsal, getting into a fistfight with Father McNally. Donny then has to save Han by telling his future in-laws about church creeping him out after an explosion that killed his parents inside of it. Donny joins Han and his other friends at the bachelor party, which is a relaxing, alcohol-free visit to a spa organized by Phil. Donny proceeds to offend everybody at the spa , before convincing the others to go to the strip club with him, where Han bonds with Brie, and everybody gets drunk, high and raucous. Donny sends the other guests home, but Phil stays and receives fellatio from a disabled stripper with a neck brace, then he and Han meet up with Vanilla Ice, a former friend of Donny's from his B-grade celebrity days. Once Donny apologizes to Ice for sleeping with his mother , the three wreak havoc through the night before returning to Steve's house, where both Donny and Ice have sex with Steve's mother and a drunk Han has sex with, then vomits on, the mannequin wearing Jamie's wedding dress. Throughout the night, Donny and Han bond. Han tells Donny that he has given him a present for being best man and Han agrees to visit Ms. McGarricle in prison; Donny, knowing that the meeting is a television set-up, tells him not to go. The following day, Jamie forces Han to take the dress to the dry cleaner and Han decides to visit his mother anyway. Donny rushes to prison to stop the meeting, but arrives too late; Randall ambushes Han, Donny, and Ms. McGarricle with a film crew and an enraged Han leaves. He refuses to sign a release form for the television appearance, leaving Donny with no money from the stunt. Donny returns to Steve's home to retrieve his belongings and overhears Jamie on a phone call, indicating that she is cheating on Han with Steve. He tries to tell Han at the rehearsal dinner that night, but Jamie comes up with a story to cover her tracks. Defeated, Donny leaves and returns to the strip club, where his friend Kenny convinces him to return and earn Jamie's forgiveness. Donny heads to the hotel where Jamie is staying, only to find her having sex with Chad, her own brother, whom Donny learns is actually a jazz dancer pretending to be a Marine. Jamie gives Donny the money he needs in exchange for his silence. Donny opens Han Solo's present to find an oven mitt, which Donny had used as a sockpuppet to comfort Han during his childhood. Touched by Han's acknowledgement of their father-son relationship, Donny realizes that he must stop the wedding, in spite of his need for Jamie's hush money. He and Vanilla Ice interrupt the wedding ceremony and Donny reveals that he is Han's father. Donny tears up Jamie's check and urges her to whisper the truth to Han – which a newly self-assured Han exposes to the entire crowd. In the ensuing fight, Jamie and Chad are both knocked unconscious, while Han accepts Donny. The following day at the strip club, Han reveals that he is dating Brie. He offers Donny the money to help pay for the unpaid taxes, but he refuses stating that it's time for him to grow up and accept responsibility. Donny is preparing to go to prison, intending to rekindle his relationship with Ms. McGarricle when both are released in 2015 – when suddenly on television, they see Tubby Tuke complete an unlikely come-from-behind victory in his marathon, winning Donny $160,000 from his earlier wager, more than enough to keep him out of prison.
