Joe Baron is a cop with financial troubles because of his wife Lisa's constant spending. One day, a burglar is reported shot at the home of a doctor. But upon investigating, Baron gets to know the dead burglar's alcoholic wife, Rosalie, and becomes aware that the doctor, Horace Van Tilden, is the head of an illegal drug syndicate. Baron begins a romantic affair with Rosalie. He and his partner, Pete Delanos, both tired of being broke, conspire to rob Van Tilden's safe. The doctor, meantime, is anxious about Rosalie knowing his business and pushes her to her death. While stealing a million dollars in cash and two bags of heroin from the safe, the cops are surprised by Van Tilden during the robbery and Delanos is shot. Baron makes a deal with the doctor that he will give back some of the drugs and loot if Van Tilden will agree to treat the seriously wounded Delanos. But after his partner dies, Baron kills the doctor. Wounded himself, he makes it home to Lisa, but knows that fellow officers from the department are on their way to put him behind bars.
