Junker Rochus and Judith Platter are in love. Rochus' mother, a domineering religious fanatic, wants him to break off the relationship and become a priest, but he is reluctant to do so. The mother swears that he will take up orders, but when he does not follow through she dies of grief. Feeling guilty, Rochus reluctantly abandons his romance with Judith and enters the priesthood. Judith commits suicide, and Rochus finds that he must preside at her funeral.
