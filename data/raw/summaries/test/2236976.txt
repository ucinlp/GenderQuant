In 1995, Lyla Novacek  is a cellist in an orchestra under strict rule of her father ([[William Sadler . Louis Connelly  is the lead singer of "The Connelly Brothers", an Irish rock band. Lyla and Louis have a chance meeting during a party after their respective concerts, and sleep together on a rooftop under a full moon, while a man with a harmonica and guitar plays an instrumental version of "Moondance" on the street below. After a rude awakening by Louis's bandmates, Lyla returns to her angered father in the morning and heads back to Chicago. Louis waits for Lyla as they had agreed, before eventually heading to the hotel Lyla was staying at, but Lyla doesn't acknowledge him. He turns to his music in the hopes she'll hear it and reconnect with him, but becomes discouraged. Meanwhile, Lyla eventually realizes she is pregnant. After an argument with her father regarding the baby and her career as a cellist, Lyla runs out into the street and is struck by a car. Due to the accident trauma, she gives birth prematurely, and her father secretly puts her son up for adoption, forging her signature on the paperwork and allowing her to believe that the baby died as a result of the accident. Eleven years later, young Evan Taylor  is living in a boys' orphanage outside New York City. Evan has the savant-like ability to hear music wherever he is. He is convinced that his parents will find him, which makes him the target of ridicule among the older kids at the orphanage. He meets Richard Jefferies , a social worker who gives Evan his card. Soon after, Evan runs away to New York City, "following the music" in the hope it will lead him to his family. In the process, he loses Jeffries' card, and wanders the city until finding Arthur  performing in Washington Square Park. Louis now lives in San Francisco, having left his band on the same night as Lyla's accident. He has a chance meeting with one of his former bandmates, and is invited to his birthday party. Louis is hesitant because he has not spoken to his brother Marshall  since the band broke up, but he ultimately chooses to go. At the party, his brother is playing clips of the band performing. Louis confronts his brother and the words come to blows, and Louis's girlfriend , leaves him. Lyla now lives in Chicago with a violinist roommate, and also gave up performing, but teaches music to children privately. Her friend and roommate encourages her to rejoin the New York Philharmonic, but Lyla is unconvinced. She is called to her father's deathbed, and he admits to her that her child survived the accident and is alive somewhere in New York. Upon hearing this, Lyla abandons her father to his fate and decides to return to New York. Evan has since followed Arthur back to his home in a condemned theater, and has been taken in by Maxwell "Wizard" Wallace , a vagrant musician who teaches homeless children music and employs them as street performers. He was the one playing the guitar and harmonica during Louis and Lyla's night on the rooftop. Evan tries playing Wizard's prize guitar "Roxanne", and while his initial approach is unconventional, he is so good that Wizard gives him his old spot in Washington Square Park, and Roxanne, both of which had until then been Arthur's. Wizard also gives Evan the stage name "August Rush" and begins trying to market him to clubs and event promoters. Seeing the posters that Jeffries has posted for the runaway Evan, Wizard destroys all the ones he finds, hoping to keep Evan and his gift for his own gain. Arthur comes to resent being replaced by August as Wizard's favorite. Louis decides to reconnect with Lyla, and after learning her full name and whereabouts, flies out to Chicago to find her. He waits for several hours at the door to her apartment. When he asks one of the occupants of her apartment where Lyla is, the woman mixes up Lyla and her roommate, and says she's on her honeymoon in New York. Louis, crushed, ends up in New York and decides get his old band back together. After a meeting on the street between Jeffries, Wizard and Arthur, the derelict theatre Wizard and his "children" are living in is raided by the police. Wizard distracts them and allows August to escape, with a warning not to tell anyone his real name. After evading the police, Evan takes refuge in an inner-city church where Hope, a young girl at the church  introduces him to the piano, and to written notes. He picks up this skill so quickly that Hope, seeing her room covered in August's handwritten music and hearing him play the church's pipe organ, gets the attention of the parish pastor , who enrolls August at the Juilliard School. August's nonconformist approach to the curriculum nevertheless impresses the Juilliard staff, and a rhapsody begins to take shape from his notes and homework assignments. Once in New York, Lyla goes to Jeffries' office for information and, after initially being turned away by the desk clerk, eventually meets with Jeffries, who is able to identify Evan as her son. She decides to stay in New York to search for him, renting a studio apartment in the city. She also decides to take up the cello again, and accepts the offer she'd been given to perform with the Philharmonic at a series of concerts in Central Park. August's gift is considered astounding among all at Juilliard, and he is selected to perform the rhapsody he's been composing at the same park concert as Lyla, the youngest student ever selected for this honor. Wizard intrudes during a rehearsal and, claiming to be his father and under threat of revealing August's real name, pulls August out of the school, putting him back in Washington Square playing Roxanne and planning to send him all over the country. On the day of the outdoor symphony concert, and also of Louis's first performance after rejoining his old band, August is still forbidden by Wizard to attend his own concert. August meets Louis, who is wandering through the park with his own guitar, and they play together, neither of them knowing their blood relationship to the other. August tells him of his dilemma and Louis tells him not to give up on his music, and that if he had a concert, he wouldn't miss it for the world. In a subway station that night, August decides to leave Wizard and go to his concert anyway, with some help from Arthur who also rebels against Wizard. August flees through the subway tunnel and towards the park where the concert is underway, following the sounds of Lyla's cello concerto performance. Wizard is last seen playing his harmonica alone in the subway. Louis is heading towards the airport when he notices Lyla's name on a banner for the concert. He jumps out of the van and heads towards the park. Meanwhile, Jeffries notices a misplaced flyer for August Rush, sent to Jeffries' office after August had been removed from Juilliard, identifies August as Evan, and heads for the concert as well. August arrives just in time to conduct his rhapsody, with Hope on stage singing and Arthur in the crowd watching August's performance. Lyla, having finished her part of the concert, begins walking away from the park, but is attracted back towards August's performance. Louis also arrives at the park and spots Lyla, reuniting with her at the front of the crowd. Jeffries arrives backstage during the performance and looks on as well. August finishes his rhapsody and, turning around, smiles at Lyla and Louis, realizing that they are his parents. The film concludes with August saying "The music is all around us, all you have to do is listen." [2007 movie]
