The movie follows a brilliant ventriloquist "The Great Gabbo"  who, as he spirals down into madness, increasingly uses his dummy "Otto" as his only means of self-expression—an artist driven insane by his work. Gabbo's gimmick is his astonishing ability to make Otto talk—and even sing—while Gabbo himself smokes, drinks and eats. Gabbo's girlfriend and assistant  loves him, but is driven to another performer  by Gabbo's deteriorating personality.
