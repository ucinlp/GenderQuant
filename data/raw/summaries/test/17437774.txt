A down-and-out Hollywood screenwriter and director named Marvin Landisman  is working on cheaply made instructional videos when his years-old script is read by Jack Roth , a desperate has-been producer who offers to help poor Marvin find investors for his movie. Men willing to put up the money are found, including the ruthless businessman Evan , the disturbed war veteran Carmine  and the eccentric millionaire George . But each has a mistress he insists be cast in the film. They are the demanding diva Beverly , the alcoholic flight attendant Patricia  and the perky blonde Peggy . Marvin repeatedly is asked to compromise his standards and change his script to accommodate these backers until he finally sees no semblance of his original ideas. The project also puts a strain on the marriage of Marvin and his long-patient wife Rachel . Marvin's screenplay is a bleak one about a painter who commits suicide, based on an actor named Warren  who did exactly that during a film Marvin was directing years ago. Roth brings in young Stuart Stratland  to adapt the script for the investors' mistresses, but not only does Stuart constantly enrage Marvin with his suggested changes, he falls in love with Peggy and they have an affair. When his wife demands Marvin grow up and move with her to New York, where she is opening a restaurant, he breaks up with Rachel instead, giving his loyalty to a film that, as she puts it, nobody wants to see. On the verge of signing contracts, everything falls apart, Beverly discovering that the role she expected to play has been drastically reduced in Peggy's favor. Marvin is left alone, a broken man, done with Hollywood for good. Or at least until the next time Jack Roth gets in touch.
