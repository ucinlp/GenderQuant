A group of college students travel to an Eastern European village. The protagonist, Jason, pulls a sword from a stone, unwittingly reviving a giant monster whose body is made of rock . Soon, Jason learns that one of his ancestors had slain this monster before with the sword, and he plans to do the same. The main antagonist, Dimitar, possesses a key stone that has the power to either kill or control the monster, and he plans to transfer the rock monster's spirit into his body with hopes of the spirit making him "omnipotent". The rock monster goes on a killing spree, regenerating and blending in with mountain and stony hill features. It rips open the skull of a man as it travels with Dimitar to the village, where it is defeated by Jason and his sword, which is revealed to be Excalibur.
