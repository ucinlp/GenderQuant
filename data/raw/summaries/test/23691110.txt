Roy Rogers, a horse dealer and a peddler of leather goods, is hoping to mate his mare named "Lady" with Golden Sovereign, a stallion owned by rancher Gabby Kendrick. Kendrick refuses, preferring to mate the stallion with his own stock. Brett Scoville, a wealthy rancher and nightclub owner, wants to mate the stallion with his mare as well, and, to that end, steals the stallion. Golden Sovereign breaks free, finds Lady, and has a romantic interlude with her in the hills. A search is raised to find Golden Sovereign, but Scoville accidentally shoots and kills the horse when Golden Sovereign is attacked a wild stallion. Roy arrives on the scene and chases Scoville off with a bullet but cannot later identify him as the killer. To all appearances, it looks like Roy is responsible for the death of Golden Sovereign, and he is arrested. He jumps bail, and takes off on Lady. Months later, Lady gives birth to Golden Sovereign's son. Roy names him Trigger and, in time, the horse becomes his mount. Roy returns to the Golden Horse Ranch to present Trigger as a gift to Kendrick. The gift is declined, and Roy is jailed as a fugitive from justice. Trigger is auctioned to pay Roy's debts. Scoville acquires the horse and, when the case against Roy is dropped, hires him to train Trigger. A year later, Scoville and Susan Kendrick enter their horses in a race at the State Fair. Roy is riding Scoville's Trigger in the race, and Scoville promises him ownership of the horse should he win the race. Roy is reluctant to race after learning Scoville killed Golden Sovereign. However, Roy races and aids Susan when Scoville's men hold her horse in a pocket on the track. Susan wins the race on Golden Empress, and, consequently, Roy loses possession of Trigger. Later, Scoville is arrested for killing Golden Sovereign, and, Roy finally comes into possession of Trigger through Kendrick. Eventually, Roy is employed at the Kendrick ranch, and Trigger becomes the father of twin sons born to Susan's Golden Empress.
