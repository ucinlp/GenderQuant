In a hazy, dreamy, sun-baked Rome in an August afternoon the timid, precise law student Roberto  is asked by a 40-ish man named Bruno  passing under his window at the wheel of a convertible Lancia Aurelia for a trivial favor: a phone call. The young man tells Bruno to come up and make the call himself; after he fails to contact his friends  Bruno insists to repay Roberto's courtesy by offering him a drink. Being tired of studying for the day the young man accepts. Thus begins a cruise along the Via Aurelia  where Roberto is unwilling or unable to part from his casual acquaintance despite having nothing in common with him. Bruno is loud, direct, a bit coarse and a braggart to boot but also charming and likable, Roberto, being his complete opposite, feels drawn to his impulsive and devil-may-care attitude. In two days of high and lows across the coasts of Lazio and Tuscany the two men manage to learn something from each other . Their friendship and male bonding is cut short when, urged by Roberto, Bruno attempts a risky maneuver resulting in an accident. The younger man falls with the car along a rocky cliff, leaving a bloodied and shocked Bruno on the curve's edge, realizing that in the time they spent together he had not even asked him his surname.
