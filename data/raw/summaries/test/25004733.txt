Twin brothers Alan and Joseph spend the summer visiting their Aunt Lacey at her secluded, run-down property. Little do they know that some family secrets refuse to stay buried...in fact, they are freshly dug up! Lonely auntie has a necrophilic attraction to her deceased husband, whose body she keeps in her house, and Jeremy - her perverted farmhand - is a bloodthirsty monster who dismembers local townsfolk and stores their body parts in the barn for unspeakable uses later on. Soon Alan and Joseph find themselves caught up in a horrifying plot to take charge of the situation. And that's when things really turn ugly. Filmed in "shockumentary" style, you will witness the final moments of one of the most brutal pages in the history of crime. Jeremy is waiting!
