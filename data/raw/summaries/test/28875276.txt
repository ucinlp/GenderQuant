Jack Davies, an art dealer from London, does a deal with a friend of his Michael Clare, the son of a gifted artist Victor Clare. Michael smuggles out some of his father's works and Davies sells them for a large sum at his gallery, splitting the profit between them. Davies and Michael Clare are both in need of more money and realising that Victor Clare's works are worth a fortune they decide to acquire some more. Unfortunately, Victor Clare is a recluse, who lives in isolation above an abandoned tin mine in Cornwall. As it would be impossible to smuggle out any more of the paintings without being noticed, Davies decides to offer the artist a deal for hard cash. They travel down to Cornwall with their wives, and they find it an odd and disconcerting experience. Victor Clare's wife has regressed into a second childhood, while he spends his time having affairs with his models. The only sense of normality is apparently provided by Bill, Victor's only friend, who cooks dinner for them.
