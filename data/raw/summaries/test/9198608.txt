The movie begins at a place which appears to be Nevada's legendary Area 51. A visiting general is led down into an underground complex where he is shown a captured alien. The alien resembles a chubby Vulcan in a cowboy costume, and greets the general with a "What are you looking at so stupidly?". The next scene opens 300 years later, in 2304. Earth is under attack by the fleet of the Mars Regulator and his asthmathic right hand  Jens Maul.<ref name1033 "Dreamship Surprise - Period 1"] German Films, official website.

They decide to call for the crew of the Surprise, Earth's last available ship, to travel 300 years back in time. Their mission is to destroy a UFO which had crashed in Nevada in 2004. Its technology had enabled mankind to colonize Mars in the first place,<ref name63 "Raumschiff Surprise: Periode 1"] Adventure Treff.

(A similar theme appears in the [[Terminator  At first, Captain Kork is very reluctant to follow the order to return to Earth immediately , but ultimately, he changes his mind. Technical problems prevent direct transport however, so Kork orders Schrotty to call a space taxi. The taxi is driven by Rock , who is found attractive by both Kork and Spuck. Rock manages to break through the Martian blockade, but during the action, the taxi is chased and damaged heavily, finally crashing beside the Queen's palace. Kork, Spuck and Schrotty are advised of their mission and are then seated into the time machine, which looks like an old sofa. When the Regulator's forces attack the capital city, Rock and Metapha join Kork and Spucky "in" the device, while Schrotty remains behind. Jens Maul acquires the time machine's manual, builds his own and follows the foursome back in time. Under constant harassment by Jens Maul, the travellers have a couple of unplanned sojourns. In 1304 Britain, during a tournament held by Lord William the Last , then in Nevada during the Wild West era, they run afoul of Santa Maria . Upon arrival in the West, the time sofa is smashed by a speeding train, but the group captures Maul's time machine and uses it to reach the year 2004. Once more, they encounter Maul, who has painstakingly reassembled the ruined time sofa, and witness the UFO crashing. It turns out to be no bigger than a football and its occupant the size of a human hand. A beer-guzzling alien emerges and, in its haste to consume more alcohol, it begins to choke. Spucky tries to help by offering Maul's asthma spray, but the pressure created by the device blows up the creature. The group obliterates the UFO and scrambles onto the sofa, just as the local military arrives. The control panel shows an overload of 76.375 kilograms â€“ Spucky's exact weight. With a heavy heart, Spucky remains behind. The story switches back to Area 51, where Spuck has just finished telling his tale. The government officials are not convinced until Spuck provides proof in the form of a futuristic piece of technology, a thermometer with a vibrating alarm, which he had inserted just before departure. As Kork, Rock and Metapha get back to the future, Spuck is already awaiting them. Spuck has survived because he's a Vulcanette, who have extraordinarily long lifespans, and has been busy re-decorating Earth within the last 300 years . Kork and his men get to participate in the Miss Waikiki contest after all - but the ever-relentless Jens Maul has the last word.
