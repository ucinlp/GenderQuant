The true story of Kent Stock , who in the early 1990s, takes the job of a lifetime as head coach of the Norway High School baseball team, a school which had won 19 State titles and equated baseball with life. Kent must win over his players and convince them and himself that he can fill their former coach's shoes all while dealing with the reality that this will be the team's final season due to an impending merger with a nearby school. In the summer of 1991, Norway High's baseball tradition ended on a triumphant but somber note. The film depicts the Norway School District merging with the "Madison School District". Norway actually was consolidated into the Benton Community School District.
