The story by revolves around how Rakesh plans to kill Kamal and take his place while they are facing the Chinese in war. In the ensuing duel, it is Kamal who emerges victorious although he feels the weight of his act on his conscience at having killed Rakesh. Fearing the consequences, he deserts the flanks, and returns home, leaving the authorities to think that actually Rakesh has become a deserter, and Kamal has become a martyr. What follows is a protracted legal battle with a rather predictable ending. In keeping with the trend of the day, the comic element was provided by the antics of Johnny Walker, Ameeta and Yunus Parvez, although, the angle did hardly anything to raise the film's level in any significant way. http://www.hindu.com/mp/2011/03/04/stories/2011030451051100.htm Shashi Kapoor essaying a double role – of a straightforward, studious Kamal and his look-alike, the rakish Rakesh, who aspires for the same lady, Babita as Archana, who is to marry Kamal. Kapoor displays panache and élan in both roles, with his dashing and debonair looks, which endowed him with a great screen presence, although his lack of histrionic depth made the portrayal of Kamal and Rakesh almost identical but for a peculiar whistling style that Rakesh had. Babita as Archana fails to impress, though the film gave her an ample chance to demonstrate her skills. She is neither convincing in her petulant reactions to Rakesh's overtures nor as Kamal's wife. Nor is she able to bring forth the angst and moral dilemma of a woman who realises that the man she thinks to be her husband might actually be his look-alike.
