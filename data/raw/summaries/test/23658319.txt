Later on an unknown planet, the merman tribe destroy everything while looking for the mermaid tribe. On Earth Nobita's mom orders him to go shopping but he leaves to play pirates with Gian. His mother asks Doraemon and her husband but they have other plans. Doraemon ends up doing the shopping: When he reads the list at the very bottom he sees Dorayaki, a Japanese snack, his favourite food. Later Suneo shares his diving photo shoots in Palau with Gian and Shizuka. Nobita arrived at their place of play to play pirates with Gian. Nobita wants to go to Suneo's house to see more pictures but they don't want him to. He cries and shouts Doraemon's name. Doraemon uses his gentle eyes to comfort him. When Nobita feels like diving in his town, Doraemon uses a Underwater Pump Simulator  to pump all the water out of Tokyo, causing the entire city to go underwater. That night, Doraemon and Nobita use a Diving Mask Simulator to dive underwater. Later on, among a lot of fish, Nobita catches a glimpse of a fish tail. He tells Doraemon he saw a mermaid. They take pictures then heard a scream. They check on what's happened but on the other side of the road the shadow of a mermaid appeared along with that of a shark. Nobita's father tells the police that he saw a shark swimming past the cigarette store. Nobita and Doraemon witness it and ask how he could see the shark without his goggles. As they take them out they see that the fish are still there but the water is gone. And then they investigate. A boy Desikuge is looking through his telescope and he see's a mermaid swimming. He looks again and it appeared again. Then a shark appeared in front of him and screamed then fainted. Meanwhile Nobita is swimming while finding the shark. Unknown to him the shark was behind him then Doraemon tells Nobita to look behind. He see's the shark and starts hiding. Then Doraemon threw a Homesick frog ogre in the sharks mouth. The shark and all the fishes swim back to the ocean and then the mermaid falls down and lands on a branch of a tree. The next day Nobita notices a fish tail beneath the leaves, when Doraemon saw this they found a girl. She jumps out and lands on the ground. In Nobita's room she drinks a lot of juice then she starts speaking in an unknown language and then Doraemon puts out his Translation Jelly. Then she mistakens Doraemon as a puffer fish. Then she introduces herself named Sophia. Later Suneo explains that he saw a shark that even Dekisugi saw it. Gian says that sharks live in the ocean. Then Nobita arrives with Doraemon and Sophia then Gian and Suneo think that she's cute. Together the gang show her around until a car stops and argues with Sophia that she might get hit but Doraemon grabs her. She see's the takecopter and starts to fly high in the sky. She flew higher and higher above the clouds but the sun made her faint and asks to get her to a place with water. Doraemon puts out his Anywhere door and they go to Shizuka's bathroom. Shizuka tells everyone to get out. Meanwhile in the bathtub, Sophia enjoys her bath while Shizuka see's a tiara. In Shizuka's bedroom, Suneo says that Sophia is a Kappa while Gian argues with him for accusing Sophia as a Kappa. Nobita asks Doraemon if mermaids exist while Gian says First a Kappa now a mermaid? Then Nobita explains that when he first met Sophia, her legs were that of a mermaid tail. Meawhile Doraemon's phone rang because Dorami his sister is calling him. She appears through a circle and asks Nobita to draw a mermaid. While Dorami explains about mermaids, Nobita shows his drawing of an ugly mermaid which made everyone laugh. Dorami explains about appearances, legends and animals mistaken as mermaids. Meanwhile in Shizuka's bathroom, Shizuka tells Sophia that she will put her clothes in the laundry but Sophia says not to touch it but Shizuka accidentally pressed a belt. Back at her bedroom Dorami has to leave then they heard a scream. Nobita, Doraemon, Gian, Suneo investigate in the bathroom. When they arrived they saw Shizuka in mermaid form while Sophia hides underwater. She explains her hometown and they go to the Anywhere door to see the stars then they go back. Doraemon uses his copy machine to copy the clothes of Sophia. They put on the clothes then Doraemon puts his Familiar Light to make them breathe underwater. Underwater they change into mermaid forms and enjoy life underwater. Then Doraemon puts his watertight rope to keep water away. Sophia says that Doraemon has powers like their goddess Manatia. Then they ask if the Mermaid Sword exists. Then Doraemon puts out his Mystery Ink and Scroll to check if it's real. It's says With those with royal blood five stars will join together to form a pentagon. They even see the mermaid tribe script. But Sophia refuses to say it for it is to ancient. The next day they dive underwater to Sophia's palace. Nobita feels tired and starts sinking slowly. A giant eel appeared behind them. They hide in a cave until they are rescued by a pufferfish named Haribo with Sophia's soldiers. They wrongly accused Doraemon, Nobita, Gian and Suneo for kidnapping Sophia. Shizuka later was kidnapped. They arrive at the home of the mermaid tribe. The gang were placed in a glass fish tank preparing to be eaten by a Megaladon. Sophia tells Haribo to stop the punishment. Gian shouts very loud that it makes everyone cover their ears. They release them and one of the soldiers told Sophia that she was to be summoned by Queen Undine, Queen and leader of the mermaid tribe and Sophia's grandmother. They arrive at the palace. Queen Undine tells Sophia that she will be queen.
