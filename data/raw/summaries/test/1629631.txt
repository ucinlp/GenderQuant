Durga Singh is a poor woman raising her two sons Karan and Arjun. Her sons give her bangles, which she says she shall give to the woman they marry. Later, when the Munim of an aging Thakur comes to talk to Durga, Karan and Arjun learn that their father is dead. Durga reveals that their father was the Thakur's son, who had married her against his father's wishes. Durjan Singh, a servant of Thakur, killed Durga's husband to prevent him, Durga or their sons from inheriting the Thakur's estate. Karan and Arjun learn from her that the dying Thakur wants to give his estate to his grandchildren before dying. Here, Durjan kills his master when latter learns the truth. Later, he kills both Karan and Arjun in front of Durga's eyes. Durga cannot accept that her sons have died. She prays to Goddess Kali to bring them back. Miraculously, Durga's prayers are heard and her sons are reborn but into different families with no knowledge of their past lives - Durga is unaware of this miracle. For 20 years she keeps persuading the people of her village that Karan and Arjun will come back. Durjan and his family often imitate her and his brothers-in-law, Shamsher and Nahar mockingly give her garlands to put on her picture of Karan and Arjun - Durga vows to place the garlands over their dead bodies. Arjun is reincarnated as Vijay. He works in a stable with his uncle after his parents die. He wins the heart of Sonia Saxena. They spend a lot of time together but neither knows that Sonia is to marry Durjan Singh's son,Suraj. Karan is reincarnated as Ajay, a professional fighter. He soon works for Saxena, Sonia's father and Durjan Singh's partner. Karan and Arjun still have nightmares about their deaths in previous lives, and none knows why. On learning about Vijay, Suraj sets his stable on fire and believes Vijay has died. However, later at Sonia and Suraj's engagement party, Vijay arrives and attacks Suraj. Ajay is sent to kill Vijay and the two start fighting. Here, Durga is given a sign of this when her photo of her sons falls. She rushes to the temple and prays. Vijay and Ajay suddenly stop fighting. Saxena tries to shoot Vijay but Ajay stops him whilst shouting "Bhaag, Arjun, Bhaag!". This is something that Ajay said to Vijay in their previous lives when they were being attacked by Durjan's men. Ajay is sent to prison whilst Vijay escapes. Vijay is confused about the incident, mostly because he had dreamt of somebody saying those exact words to him. Sonia is forcibly being taken to Durjan Singh's house to marry Suraj. She writes to Vijay begging him to come and rescue her. Vijay and his friend travel to save Sonia. Everybody who sees him is stunned and calls him Arjun. He remembers the details in flashes and reunites with Durga. Vijay saves Ajay and explains him the whole situation while heading back to save Sonia. Ajay refuses to believe, but when Durjan's brothers-in-law attack Durga, Ajay is also convinced and fights them off with Vijay. Durjan hears about Karan and Arjun returning but refuses to believe it so his brothers-in-law attempt to bring them before him. In the process they are killed and Durga places the garlands they gave her over their dead bodies. At the village temple, rituals are held for Sonia and Suraj's wedding. Karan and Arjun have teamed up with their allies and frighten Durjan by convincing him that they are back. Soon, Saxena and Durjan have a fallout, after which a fearful Saxena tells Sonia to run away with Vijay. Sonia meets Vijay, but just as everybody is helping them, Durjan and Saxena arrive, making them realize that it was a ruse. Ajay succeeds in creating a diversion, letting Vijay and Sonia escape. Vijay kills Suraj, upon which Durjan kills Saxena in a fit of rage. After all his henchmen are killed, Durjan attempts to kill Karan and Arjun. They overpower him until he falls on his knees. He runs to Durga and begs her for forgiveness. However, she orders her sons to kill him for revenge. They do so and Durga places the garland he gave her over his dead body, fulfilling the promises she made to him. Later, Arjun marries Sonia and Karan marries Bindiya, after which Durga places the bangles her sons gave her on her daughters-in-law's wrists, as she promised Karan and Arjun 20 years ago.
