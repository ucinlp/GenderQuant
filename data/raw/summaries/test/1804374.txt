Joseph Frail—doctor, gambler, gunslinger—rides into town looking to set up a business. He passes by the "hanging tree," an old oak with a thick branch over which has been slung a noose. He rescues Rune, a sluice robber who has been shot, and forces him into indentured servitude. A stagecoach is robbed and overturned, killing the driver and a male passenger. But the daughter of the male passenger is believed to have survived. A search party is formed, and Elizabeth Mahler is found by the town opportunist "Frenchy." Cripled by burns, blindness and dehydration received from overexposure, Elizabeth is moved into the doctor's house to begin her recovery. The placement gains much chagrin from the town's women, who believe that she may be paying for her medical care through illicit behavior. Frenchy sneaks in under the guise of trying to strike a business deal with Elizabeth, but instead tries to forcefully kiss her. Frail witness the aggression and chases Frenchy back to town. Frail beats him up and threatens to kill him. There are many witnesses, including a mad faith healer, Dr. Grubb, who sees Frail's medical practice as a threat. Elizabeth regains her sight and makes romantic overtures toward Frail. He rejects her. She leaves in a huff, determined to strike it rich as a prospector so that she can pay off Frail and get out from under his control. She teams up with Rune and Frenchy, who plan to buy a claim and set up a sluice. To get money, she pawns a family heirloom. It is worthless, but Frail tells the pawnbroker to give her however much money she needs. Thus Frail secretly continues to control her. She finds out and asks Frail why he couldn't respond to her affection. He reveals that his wife had an affair with his own brother. He found them together, both dead, an apparent murder-suicide. In a rage, he burned down their house with their bodies in it. He tells Elizabeth he is "not allowed to forget." The trio of Elizabeth, Frenchy and Rune strike it rich, finding a "glory hole{{dn}}" of gold under a tree stump. They ride into town as heroes, tossing pieces of gold to the townsfolk. The gaiety quickly turns into a riot lead by the lawless members. While the lawful citizens of the town are engaged in firefighting, Frenchy takes advantage of the comotion to make advances on Elizabeth. Her disinterest sparks his brutal physical assault as he attempts to rape her. Frail again catches Frenchy during this new aggressive act, but this time kills him. The lawless portion of rioting people in town witness this. Seeing his opportunity to remove his "competition", the faith healer incites the mob to lynch Frail. They carry him to the hanging tree and string him up. Rune and Elizabeth rush in carrying their gold and the deed to the claim. Elizabeth offers everything to the townsfolk if they will let Frail live. As the mob members fight each other to grab the gold and claim document, the lynch party disperses. Elizabeth feels she has finally paid Frail back. Rune takes the noose off and Frail calls out to Elizabeth to come back.
