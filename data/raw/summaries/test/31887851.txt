The two families are so close that they virtually share the same house. The Nawab's daughter, Husn Bano, has an affair with a young man named javed & gets pregnant. When the Nawab attempts to arrange her marriage with javed, he finds that javed has disappeared. Amrit Rai and his wife Savitri assist Husn with the birth of a baby boy, Dilip, and even adopt him and give him their family name. Young Dilip is a cute young child, the apple of the Badruddin and the Rai households. Husn then gets married to another young man, Javed and moves to another location. In the meantime, while participating in a protest to force the British to leave India the Nawab gets killed. Years later, Husn Bano and Javed return to a warm welcome by the Rai family. Then she meets Dilip - not the Dilip she had left behind - this Dilip is fascist, a Muslim-hater, who has joined forces with other extremists, in order to force Muslims to leave India and even go to the extent of burning buildings and killing them. How can Husn and Dilip adapt to each other with so much hate and distrust between them?
