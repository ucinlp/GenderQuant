Lauren King  is a highly intelligent 13-year-old American girl living in Paris with her affluent family. She spends her free time reading Heidegger. Daniel Michon  is a highly intelligent 13-year-old French boy from a poor family who loves Hollywood films and who uses his talent with mathematics to make theoretical bets on horse races. The two meet at a museum where a movie is being filmed, and they fall in love. Lauren's self-absorbed mother  fiercely objects to the romance, seeing him as a "filthy French boy" unsuitable for her daughter. When Daniel punches the egomaniacal director boyfriend of Lauren's mother, the two are forbidden to date. Lauren and Daniel meet Julius , a kindly elderly gentleman and a pickpocket, who tells them about a tradition that if a couple kiss beneath the Bridge of Sighs in Venice at sunset while the church bells toll, they will be in love forever. Knowing that she will be sent back to America soon, she initiates a plan for them to travel to Venice together. With the help of Julius, the two young lovers take a train to Venice and spark an international chase.
