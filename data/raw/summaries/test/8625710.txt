Set in a 1914 lower class district of Paris, the film focuses on a content sewer worker named Chico , who is criticized by his fellow citizens for being an atheist. One day, he witnesses a young woman  being brutally beaten by her sister  among a crowd for not entertaining a senior wealthy man in her sleazy bar. He sympathizes with the girl, Diane, and stops the fight. Later, Father Chevillon , who is worried about Chico's non-believing thoughts, offers him a deal: he will grant him a street washer job if he takes in Diane and opens his mind about believing in God. Chico agrees, and he prevents Diane's sister from turning Diane in to the police by claiming that she is his wife. Because Diane has become very suicidal, Chico shares his optimistic views with her and takes her to his garret, situated above seven flights of stairs. Even though there is no luxury, Diane - used to worse surroundings - thinks of the place as heaven. The same night, Chico and Diane realize that they like each other, though they ignore their feelings. The next day, they celebrate Chico's new job at his neighbours, the Gobins. Unbeknownst to Chico, Diane received a visit from a gendarme earlier that morning to check the reliability of her 'marriage'. Eccentric neighbour Aristide the Astrologer  chastises Diane for keeping secrets from Chico and confronts her with taking advantage of him, as well as blaming her for ruining his chances of a wealthy life. Upset, Diane leaves and finds comfort in a bar, where she allows a man to seduce her. Chico, meanwhile, has found out about the confrontation and locates her in the bar. There, he beats up the man, takes Diane home and assures her that he is not too good to be with her. As time passes, Diane loses her timid personality and shows her feelings for Chico, which leads to a loving relationship. They are about to marry, when Chico suddenly receives a draft notice. Before leaving with Gobin , Chico promises her that they are married in the eyes of God and promises to think of her every morning. Shortly after his departure, Diane's sister comes to the garret to lure Diane back to the caf√©, but Diane, now mentally strong because of Chico's love, beats her up until she runs away. Four years pass, as Chico fights on the front, and Diane works as a nurse. After the war, Gobin and Aristide claim to Diane that Chico was killed in the War, but she refuses to believe them, until Father Chevillon gives her a medal that Chico give him on the front. Heartbroken, she renounces her belief in God, but in the morning she strongly feels her lover's presence. She rushes home, where she locates a blind but alive Chico. The couple embraces each other and restore their faith.
