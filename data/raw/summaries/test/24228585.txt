When the multi-billion dollar corporation GTX is downsized in the midst of the recession, many employees are fired, including Bobby Walker . He is a white-collar corporate ladder-climbing employee with a six-figure salary, with a wife, a teenage son and a little daughter. He gets outplacement services, but without success. He gradually loses luxuries such as his country club membership and his Porsche, and he finally has to sell his expensive house with a large mortgage, and move in with his parents. Ultimately Walker has to take a manual labor job installing drywall with his blue-collar brother-in-law, Jack Dolan . Company CEO James Salinger  suffers no misfortune during the trying times. His long-standing partner Gene McClary  queries his strategy and asks whether it is still necessary to be spending money on building a new corporate headquarters, although Salinger does not want to hear it and points out that the deep cuts are necessary to increase profits and keep the company in business and stockholders satisfied. Later a senior manager, Phil Woodward ([[Chris Cooper , who had risen from the factory floor to the corporate offices, is also fired. When McClary demands of senior HR manager Sally Wilcox  - who is also his mistress - that Woodward's firing be cancelled, she tells him that he too is being fired. Woodward's life quickly falls apart; his former colleagues abandon him, and employer after employer tells him he is too old to start a new career. At his wife's request, he goes out every morning as usual, to keep his situation secret for the neighbors, but he cannot find anything to help him with mounting bills. Frustrated and depressed, he eventually commits suicide. McClary is a wealthy man as a shareholder of the firm , but he would like to put people to work, and feels guilty about his company ruining so many lives. Feeling the need for a change, he leaves his wife and starts his own business; Walker is the first person he hires.
