Peter Facinelli portrays Lucciola, an "opium-addicted has-been sculptor who is a member of a small clique of eccentric foreign artists who have settled in Montmartre,  to create art, consume drugs and alcohol, and generally wreak havoc", according to writer and director John Charles Jopson. The film is a story about a woman in a man’s world. That woman is Artemesia von Rach, , a woman who takes the mind and heart of Lucciola. Jopson said that The Absinthe Drinkers "isn't about absinthe per sé. The title comes from the many similarly titled paintings of the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist period: Manet, Degas, Jean-François Raffaëlli, Picasso – they all made at least one painting with the title The Absinthe Drinker." The cast of The Absinthe Drinkers includes John Hurt, Tim Roth, Joey Bergeron, Keith Carradine, Peter Facinelli, Alicja Bachleda, Jürgen Prochnow, Nikolai Kinski, Alessio Boni, Pasquale Esposito, Gaetano Guarino, and Stefania Stefanin. The film is set for principal photography in spring 2012 in Paris, Tuscany, and Poland.
