In the past, two young boys are playing with toys. One of the boys picks up his toy and smashes it over his twin brothers head. Newspaper articles then show the events that happened between then and now. In the present day five teenagersâ€”Kate , Zack , Vicky , Riff , and Ashley  -- are on their way to their campsite during Spring Break when they make a wrong turn and wind-up at a grave site where they meet two odd men who tell them a 'spooky' story. They end their story by pointing to store and saying that's 'town'. The teens then make their way into the store while Zack fills the gas up. The four teens meet the strange brothers Simon  and Stanley while picking up some items. Zack walks in and asks if he can get some coolers and realizes a photo hanging above the entryway, it shows two young boys wearing cowboy outfits and their parents. Zack then begins talking about Billy the Kid and all the killing he did. Well, during this Stanley is orgasmically rubbing the wooden wall remembering his past, in which he is seen killing his brother and parents. As the teens walk out Zack and Vicky rush Ashley out by calling her dog. Before leaving, however, Zack asks Stanley if he has any zig zags in which Stanley says smoking can kill. The teens are then shown at their campsite getting ready to split-up. Ashley jogs off saying she needs an hour of exercise each day, according to her trainer. Riff goes off in search of wood with Ashley following him leaving Zack and Kate alone. In the forest Vicky is seen seducing Riff but it is quickly broken off by Ashley who bumps into them. Riff finishes up and says 'This is wrong.' leaving Ashley alone. At the campsite Zack and Kate are fighting and Zack sets off back to the store to get some propane. Riff returns and starts kissing Kate when Ashley runs past them saying 'Jeez Riff, two in one! I don't care what you do with these other two sluts but stay away from me!' which pisses Kate off. The film then follows Ashley on her run where she is attacked by Stanley. She escapes from him and starts to run when she gets caught on a tree root sticking out of the ground and twists her ankle. Stanley is then shown cutting up Ashley when a dog steals her hand and runs away leaving Stanley to chase after it. The dog, now identified as 'Reggie B', runs into his owner with Stanley not to far away. Stanley kills the dogs and takes the hand, all in front of the owner. The owner runs back to her own campsite and warns her companions that a man killed Reggie B. Stanley appears with Reggie B is his hands and throws it a tree. A man attempts to catch the dog but is killed by Stanley. Another lady attempts to fight Stanley but is only killed by a hidden dagger and hung with her friend. Back at the store Zack arrives and finds it empty. This prompts him to explore the store while Simon and Simon make out. He finds numerous bodies all dangling from the ceiling and several newspaper articles. Shocked Zack grabs a few articles and drives away without his propane. Meanwhile, Stanley is hanging Reggie B's owner near the road. Upon noticing Zack's van approaching, Simon swings Reggie B's owner into the path of the van, killing her. He then throws Reggie B onto the road making Zack believe he killed it. Back at the campsite Stanley meets the four teens and tells them that Simon is missing. The teens say that Ashley is also missing and say they'll help Stanley if he helps them. Stanley leaves as Zack arrives. With Stanley gone Zack shows his friends the newspaper articles. Scared they go their van but find the tires slashed. This prompts them to run into the forest and accidentally run into a cut up Ashley, who Stanley turned into a disc player. The teens all run away and Riff is killed by swinging poles. Vicky finds her way to the other campsite but is killed and hung by Stanley. Kate gives herself in hoping for the best and Stanley leads her to a table that has his dead parents sitting at it. 'Simon' appears and asks for a 'hand' sandwich but has his fingers chopped off by Stanley. Stanley then reveals that Simon has been in a coma for years and he has been doing all the killing. With this information revealed he kills Zack by burning him with a large 'fatty', where he is burned alive in a similar scenario to the witch burnings. Kate attempts to seduce Stanley, promising him his long overdue attention, while reaching for a cleaver Stanley had left on the table. When Kate finally grabs hold of the cleaver she attempts to kill Stanley who over throws the table, accidentally freeing her. Completely out of his mind, he vows to kill Kate who is hiding, only to reveal herself by bursting out of Zack's charred corpse, finally stabbing him in the head with the cleaver. It appears Stanley is dead, however when she looks back to where his corpse should be, he has disappeared and then finally captures Kate. The film ends with an almost identitical group of youths at the store and asking for directions to a campsite. Stanley taps on his head, which has metal inside his skull, explaining to the audience how he survived Kate's surprise attack. As they leave Stanley goes inside and opens up a trapdoor revealing Kate and two crying twins in a filthy living condition, obviously kept hostage.
