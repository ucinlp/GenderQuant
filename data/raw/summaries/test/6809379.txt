His whole aim in life is to see that Surya's life is beset with problems, thanks to him. However, Surya and his parents are blissfully unaware of the jealousy that has possessed Raghuvaran. When he discovers the love between Surya and Jyotika he passes on the word to Jyotika's elder brother who is a known rowdy around the area. He does this thinking that the rowdy would manage to beat up Surya and perhaps separate both Surya and Jyotika. This plan backfires, when the rowdy is more than happy to get them both married because more than anything, he cares about his sister's happiness. Raghuvaran then pushes Surya over a cliff edge. The rest of the movie is about whether Raghuvaran will find the love and care that he has always yearned for from his parents.
