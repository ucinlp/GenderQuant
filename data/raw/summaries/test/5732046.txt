There is no real plot that runs throughout this documentary. Instead, each skater was placed into their segment to showcase their skills. Some of the skaters also incorporated a short story into their segments. Some of these story lines include McCrank looking for a job, Berra being killed by an unknown attacker, Reynolds hanging out with a monkey, Kirchart and Klein's rampaging mayhem in the city and Lasek taking down Hawk so that Lasek can become the number one skateboarder.
