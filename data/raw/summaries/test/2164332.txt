{{expand section}} Ford Fairlane is seen sitting on a beach smoking as the film opens. A flashback initiates, showing a roaring crowd at a concert given by fictional popular heavy metal band The Black Plague. Lead singer Bobby Black  makes an eccentric entrance down a zip-line onto the stage and begins performing. Shortly into one of the band's songs, Bobby Black collapses on stage and dies. After The Black Plague singer is murdered onstage, shock-jock Johnny Crunch,  an old friend who came west with Fairlane, hires Ford to track down a mysterious teenage groupie named Zuzu Petals who may have a connection to Bobby Black's death. Soon after hiring Fairlane, Crunch is electrocuted on the air. The world's hippest detective soon finds himself trading insults with a ruthless record executive , a clueless cop and former disco star , a merciless hit man  and countless ex-girlfriends out for his blood. Aiding and abetting Fairlane in this whodunnit is loyal assistant Jazz  and a hip record producer  at the head of a bizarre lineup of suspects, victims, beautiful women and a koala as he finds himself hip-deep in the case of his life. The macguffin of the film is three data CDs which, when read simultaneously, detail the illegal dealings of Julian Grendel, who murdered Bobby Black when he found out Black had acquired them. The first disc was with Colleen Sutton, the second with Zuzu Petals, and the third disc was hidden under the star for Art Mooney on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
