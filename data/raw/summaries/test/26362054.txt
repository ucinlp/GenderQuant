A couple of ex-cons, Harry and Roy, break into a home expecting to find $250,000 in a safe, but come away empty-handed. They do, however, take 8-year-old Gary with them, hoping that the boy's father will pay a ransom. Harry forms a bond with Gary, who has multiple allergies, is home-schooled and has rarely been out in the world. Roy resents the kid-glove treatment of the boy and becomes at odds with his partner over what to do with him.
