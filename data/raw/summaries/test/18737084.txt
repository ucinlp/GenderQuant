Ken Li Wen-Kin is a senior member of the Hong Kong Police Force. He has an egocentric and overpowering personality. He is intolerant of mistakes, his underlings and girlfriend, Brenda suffering due to his macho personality. The main action begins when Inspector Li is brought in to investigate a cop who has committed a crime. On interrogation the cop reveals that he remembers nothing since he met a man the night before. The strange circumstances lead Li to Jack Lai who is a master hypnotist and also in jail for manslaughter after taking the rap for a murder his wife committed under duress. Jack clearly knows who is responsible but is also clear that only he can identify the culprit. Li therefore springs Jack from jail and takes him along. Although they fail to catch the criminal, it is clear from the evidence in the apartment that there is a plot to steal two Egyptian diamonds worth millions. Inadvertently hypnotized by Jack, Inspector Li retrieves the diamonds from the safe. Jack takes them and heads off to give them to Ocean, who is holding his wife hostage. Inspector Li is arrested for stealing the diamonds. His colleagues use the situation to settle some old scores. On route to jail, Inspector Li escapes by jumping from the Qing Ma Bridge. His girlfriend, Brenda, still hopelessly in love with him, helps him to evade recapture to pursue Jack and the criminal mastermind Ocean in order to recover the diamonds. Unpredictable and easily upset Ocean finds that Jack has double crossed him, in order to ensure compliance he places Jack's wife and his partner's children inside a vacuum chamber to slowly run out of air. Jack returns to the scene to retrieve the diamonds and runs into Inspector Li. Together with Brenda they go after Ocean. On arrival they split up to search the complex. Jack searches desperately for his wife, finally finding her inside the locked vacuum chamber. Brenda is taken by one of Ocean's men and although Li has Ocean cornered the situation becomes desperate, as he is forced to choose between his girlfriend and taking out Ocean. Finally, Li helps Jack to cause an explosion to wipe out Ocean. They hide in the second vacuum chamber as the oxygen cylinders detonate. Able now to reach his wife, Ching desperately tries to wake her to no avail. Mortally wounded, he lays his head on her lap as he dies. His wife comes to slowly and sees her husband, but is too late. Li finally realizes that there is more to life than work and begins to treat his girlfriend better.
