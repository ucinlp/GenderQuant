The film is an adaptation of The Wonderful Adventures of Nils by Selma Lagerl√∂f. The naughty boy Nils, who delights in torturing animals, is bewitched by a tomte. Now shrunken to a small size and able to talk to animals, he flies across Lapland on the backs of wild geese. During these dangerous travels he does many noble deeds, and, at the same time, searches for the tomte who would take the spell away.
