Pilger returns to the Occupied Territories of the West Bank and Gaza where he filmed a documentary with the same title in 1974. He believes the basic problems are unchanged: a desperate, destitute people whose homeland is illegally occupied by the world's fourth biggest military power. He hears extraordinary stories from Palestinians, though most of his interviews are with Israelis whose voices are seldom heard, including the remarkable witness of a man who lost his daughter in a suicide bombing.
