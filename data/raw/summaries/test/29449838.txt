Bhaskar assures to get them married after Suruli is released and Ramaiah asks Mynaa to stay in his house for shelter. However, Bhaskar instead asks Ramaiah to let Mynaa stay in his house, where his furious wife, still waiting for him, falsely accuses him of having an affair with Mynaa and storms out of the house. Sudha's brothers arrive at Sudha's house and kill Mynaa, who they find responsible for the trouble, and throw her body on a railway track. Upon witnessing this Suruli jumps in front of another train. This incident results in a major reaction by Bhaskar, who kills his wife and her brothers and goes to jail.
