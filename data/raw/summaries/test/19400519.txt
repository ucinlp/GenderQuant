Although Spanky would like to play football with the rest of the gang, he is stuck at home taking care of his baby sister. Hoping to lull the kid to sleep, thereby allowing himself to sneak out of the house, Spanky tries all sorts of "sure-fire" beddie-bye methods. But neither he nor his co-conspirator "Alfalfa" are able to coerce the little brat into drifting off to dreamlandâ€”though they do briefly fall asleep themselves.Their efforts finally fail when, in the process of inflating the football, they cause its air sac to burst loudly, waking the baby and ruining all their efforts.
