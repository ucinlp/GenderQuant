Lemuel "Lem" Siddons  is a saxophonist in a traveling band in 1930 who dreams of becoming a lawyer. When the band's bus reaches Hickory, a small town, Lem suddenly decides to leave the band and settle down, finding a job as a clerk in the general store. At the civic meeting, Lem notices that Vida Downey , soon to be his future wife, eliminated the YMCA and the 4-H from her list of three possible organizations to keep the town's boys off the streets, leaving only the Boy Scouts, and volunteers to become Scoutmaster of newly formed Troop 1. Lem turns out to be an all-around natural leader, and as he becomes more and more involved with the Scout troop, he finds his plans to become a lawyer being put on the back burner while he wins over the town's favor a little at a time, even as he encounters life's troubles along the way. Lem's life became fulfilled helping the town's boys, especially former troublemaker Whitey , mature into men.synopsis In appreciation, the entire town gave Lem a surprise celebration on October 2, 1950 , with  all of the Scouts during the twenty years of Troop 1 in attendance.{{cite web}}
