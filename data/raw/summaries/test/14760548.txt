 The new vicar  of St. Peter's Church is astonished to learn that the long-serving verger, Albert Foreman ([[James Hayter , is illiterate. When Foreman refuses to learn to read, the vicar feels he has no choice but to fire him. On the way back to his lodgings, Foreman notices that there is not a tobacconist shop in the area. Needing work, he decides to open one. He also takes the opportunity to propose to his landlady, Emma . Their fledgling business is very successful, and Foreman soon sets up another shop, run by his stepdaughter and her husband. Over the next decade, Foreman starts up more and more shops, becoming a wealthy man in the process and depositing his profits at the bank. The bank manager  recommends that he invest his sizable savings in order to get a better return on his money, causing Foreman to reveal that he has not been able to because he could not read the necessary papers. The stunned manager exclaims  'what would you be if you could read?'; Foreman replies that he would be the verger of St. Peter's Church.  Reserved Mr. Gray  finds himself forced to share a cabin on an ocean liner with the loud, opinionated, supremely self-confident gem dealer Max Kelada . Kelada soon dominates all the onboard social gatherings, much to the annoyance of his fellow passengers, who take to calling him "Mr. Know-All" behind his back because of his insistence that he is an expert on all subjects. One night, he remarks on the fine quality of the pearl necklace worn by the pretty Mrs. Ramsay , who has rejoined her husband  after a two-year separation caused by his work. Mr. Ramsay bets him that the pearls are fake; Kelada swiftly accepts the wager, despite Mrs. Ramsay's attempt to call it off. While examining the pearls, Kelada observes that the woman is very uneasy. He then admits that he was wrong and pays Mr. Ramsay. Afterwards, back in their cabin, Gray and Kelada are surprised when a banknote is slipped under their door. Gray gets Kelada to tell the truth: the pearls are real and very costly. Kelada adds that he would not have left such an attractive wife alone for that long. Gray begins to warm to his cabinmate.  Writer Mr. Ashenden  is sent to a sanatorium for his health.
