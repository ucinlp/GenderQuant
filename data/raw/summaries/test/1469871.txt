Kat Ellis  is a single New Yorker who returns to her parents' house in London to be the maid of honor at her younger half sister's  wedding. The best man is none other than her former fiancé, who unexpectedly dumped her two years ago. Anxious about confronting him and eager to impress him, she hires suave escort Nick Mercer  to pose as her boyfriend. Kat intends to make her former flame, Jeffrey , jealous, but her plan backfires when Nick convinces everyone, including her, that they are madly in love. Kat then feels herself, too, falling for Nick as he slowly falls for her. Along the way, Kat discovers her half sister, Amy, slept with Jeffrey while they were still together. Jeffrey dumped Kat because he believed he was in love with Amy. Amy confesses her betrayal to her fiancé, Ed , just before the church ceremony. However, Ed decides that he loves Amy more than he is angry, and they end up getting married after all. Kat and Nick end up together. Jeffrey, the main reason for all the trouble, learns absolutely nothing. At the end he is seen, possibly in France, as Nick jokingly said to Ed, trying to get the attentions of a female neighbor.
