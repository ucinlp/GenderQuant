A mad scientist named Dr. Viktor Vasilienko  is disillusioned with capitalist society and creates a virus that is designed to make people rage with anger. In his hidden laboratory in the woods, he begins testing the virus on innocents. His experiments don't go as planned and his infected victims escape into the wilderness. There, the infection spreads as vultures eat the remains of the test subjects and become out of control with the compulsion to eat human flesh.
