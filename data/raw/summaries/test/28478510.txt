{{Unreferenced section}} Set in 1928 Chicago, the film opens with two gangsters killing a store owner. Mobster Big Ed ([[Paul Douglas  sends his top henchman Bugsy Welch  to place a white carnation - his trademark - on the corpses, to suggest that he is responsible. The police rush to arrest Big Ed, only to find out that he has an alibi. He has been in the park all day, where Big Ed encounters Ruth Manning  a young country girl who came to Chicago in hopes of becoming a singer, but is now occupied as a children's governess. Big Ed immediately falls in love with the woman - who in his opinion has class - and because he has been feeling empty for a while, he is determined to court her. He poses as a widowed father and offers her to take care of his child, with the promise of tripling her salary. When she kindly accepts the job, he quickly sends Bugsy to audition a son for him. Bugsy comes up with Harry the Kid Jr. , the young but foul-mouthed son of a gangster. She grows close to Big Ed, but is offended when he gives her an expensive fur coat on Christmas Eve, thinking that he wants to 'buy' her affection. She packs her bags to leave, but Big Ed convinces her to stay until they find Harry a school. The next day, the mansion is surrounded by the men of Pretty Willie Wetzchahofsky , Big Ed's arch rival. Ruth wants to warn the police, but is discouraged to do so by Big Ed's friend and posing maid Mamie Sage , who then reveals to her who Big Ed really is. Unlike Harry, Ruth is appalled at the idea, but decides to stay until Harry is enrolled at a military academy. Meanwhile, Big Ed has come to a truce with Pretty Willie, and they agree to not interfere with each other's mob activities. Some months later, Ruth accepts a job as a singer in Big Ed's former night club. Big Ed attends her opening night and wants to reconcile, but Pretty Willie - who is also interested in Ruth - smears Ed's image, which convinces Ruth that Big Ed is a ruthless killer. She refuses to interfere with him, until she finds out that Harry has been missing from military school. After finding him, she finds out through Bugsy that Big Ed has not hurt anyone in his life, and that all his alleged victims - including Mamie's husband - are kept as prisoners in his basement. Meanwhile, these prisoners are able to escape and show up at a party. Pretty Willie is disappointed that Big Ed is not the tough guy he thought he was, and orders for his men to kill him. They, however, are thankful of Big Ed's kindness and help him escape while faking his death. Bugsy helps him by identifying a body as Big Ed, and during 'his' funeral, Ed shows up and surprises Ruth. She admits that she was crushed to think that he was dead, and they kiss. Big Ed has Pretty Willie arrested, and then joins Ruth, Harry and Bugsy on a ship, will they will be married.
