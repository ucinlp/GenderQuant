The cartoon opens with Oswald attempting to get the cow out of bed. When he succeeds, Oswald gets on the cow's back, shouting "MILK! MILK!" He gets some milk for a baby hippopotamus. When Fanny, Oswald's girlfriend, comes over, Oswald tries to flirt with Fanny. Suddenly, a car with some dark, unidentified figures appears, and the figures steal Fanny. In an attempt to rescue her, Oswald quickly starts a streak of surreal moves, including taking the cow's neck and bending it into a C-shape so when a bullet comes, it is shot back in the direction of the dark figures. The dark figures end up falling into a lake, and Oswald and Fanny walk off with the cow.
