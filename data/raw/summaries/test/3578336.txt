According to an Inc. Magazine article in January 2006, the film is a thriller that revolves around the murder of a young single mother who works at the "Lee Middelton" doll factory. The movie is about three people living along the Ohio River who are just able to make ends meet. The first character is Martha , a portly middle-aged woman seen getting ready for work and taking care of her elderly father. On the way to work at the doll factory, she picks up a co-worker, Kyle . He is probably Martha's only friend, as she has to spend most of her time working and taking care of her father. Kyle is a tall young man who is intensely shy and very quiet, although he opens up with Martha. In order to meet demand, the doll factory hires Rose , an attractive single mother. Martha appears to dislike Rose from the beginning, perhaps feeling threatened by Kyle's staring at the younger woman. Rose has a two-year old daughter and used to work in a nursing home. Rose irritates Martha by asking her for a ride to her second job. Martha found Rose "pushy" from the beginning. Rose asks Martha if she would like to make a little extra money, as she has a date and needs a baby-sitter. Martha accepts but frames her response as if she is doing Rose the favor. It is not until Kyle arrives to pick Rose up that Martha learns the identity of Rose's date. Martha later says to Rose that being so surprised made her feel like an idiot. During the date Kyle and Rose share that they each dropped out of high school, Kyle because of having social anxiety disorder and Rose because she wanted to rebel. Later in the evening, at Kyle's house, Rose sifts through his drawers and steals some cash while Kyle is grabbing a couple of beers to drink. When Kyle drops Rose off at home, he refuses to go inside with her because he felt a "weird vibe" from Martha earlier. As soon as Rose enters her house, her ex-boyfriend  barges in and accuses her of stealing money from his house. They get in a shouting match and he eventually leaves. Martha was sitting on the couch while they argued and after he leaves, she asks Rose if that was her daughter's father. Rose angrily tells her to mind her own business. The next morning the cops are at Rose's house. They say that the neighbors found her dead when they heard her baby crying. There is no sign of forced entry. Strangulation bruises on her neck suggest that she was murdered. A detective questions Rose's ex-boyfriend and Kyle, who each claim to know nothing about the murder. During this time, Martha is pawning some of her family jewelry in order to afford some fishing equipment as a gift for Kyle. When she arrives at Kyle's house to give him the gift, he tells her of Rose's murder. Surprised, she says she knows nothing. When the detective talks to her, she repeats that. and she relates the same thing. During follow-up questioning, the detective tells Martha that the fingerprints found around Rose's neck match hers. He tells her to confess, as there can be no doubt as to the murderer's identity. Martha maintains her innocence. As the story progresses, the detective visits Martha's father, who is being cared for by someone else . When the detective tells Martha's father of her arrest, he is shocked. Kyle visits Martha in prison. As they sit with a glass wall between them, conversing on telephones, Martha pleads with him to help her. She swears that she doesn't know what happened and that she did not murder Rose. Kyle appears wary of Martha. Later, in her jail cell, she sees herself in a vision standing over Rose's dead body, as she mutters, "Oh my God." *Deleted scenes include an alternate ending in which Martha has a CAT scan, which shows she has a severely malignant tumor in her brain. The doctor explains that the tumor could cause blackouts and highly abnormal behavior.
