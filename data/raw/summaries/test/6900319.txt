{{Plot}} Spike is putting his son, Tyke, to bed. When a chirping canary flies by, Spike calmly tells the canary to be quiet. However, Tom and Jerry's usual antics wake Tyke up, and Spike asks Tom "Hey, What's the big idea of waking up my boy?!", but the puppy gets the hiccups. Spike is understandably annoyed by both the noise and hiccups and explains that every time he wakes up disturbed from his nap, he gets the hiccups. Spike threatens Tom, placing responsibility on Tom to keep quiet. Jerry immediately bites Tom's tail, who screams startledly in pain, waking up Tyke a second time. With all the blame on him, the cat flees; each successive hiccup from Tyke pushes him another couple inches into the air before Spike pats him on the back. Tom peeks around the corner and Jerry pops his head out of a flower pot. Tom chases after Jerry with a shovel, but Spike quickly hears Tom and Jerry again and plugs Tyke's ears, but Jerry climbs onto the top of Spike's head, such that Tom accidentally whacks Spike on the head. Spike yells in pain, unwittingly disturbing his son again and grabs Tom by the upper-arms before the cat can run away; meanwhile, Tyke resumes hiccuping, eventually literally bunny-hopping across the ground. Spike tries to stop his son by holding him, but each subsequent hiccup literally carries Spike with him. Next, Tom is again chasing Jerry, and eventually spots Jerry diving underneath Tyke's cradle. Tom slides his hand underneath the cradle to catch Jerry, but instead meets Jerry's mousetrap. Tom gets ready to scream in pain, but manages to hold his breath until he puts a pair of earmuffs on both of the dogs, such that the dogs don't hear the cat screaming. Out for revenge, Tom pursues Jerry, who crawls into a hosepipe; Tom blows into the hosepipe and Jerry is sent out of the other end. Knowing the cat will continue blowing mindlessly until he catches the mouse, Jerry removes the dogs' earmuffs and inserts a trumpet on the other side of the hose, waking up Spike and Tyke. . The dog angrily marches up to Tom and shoves the trumpet onto Tom's head, which makes Tom's head literally seem small. Jerry happily walks out of his mousehole, only to run back inside when Tom spots him and lies in wait for the mouse to emerge. The crafty mouse emerges behind the cat, places some bicycle horns on Tom's feet, and then walks up to Tom's face and kisses him. An angry Tom chases after Jerry, but the bicycle horns squeak every time his feet touch the ground. Tom solves this by tiptoeing on his hands until Jerry trips him up; Tom falls down behind Spike, landing on his feet again. Only Spike wakes up, but the elder canine does not see Tom behind him. He turns around, but Tom turns around with him, still remaining out of Spike's eyesight, if not ears. Spike looks between his legs, at which point Tom climbs Spike's back so he can't be seen. Unfortunately, Tom's tail drops down into the dog's view, and Spike catches on. He chases after Tom, and the bicycle horns start squeaking again. Spike pauses the chase, instructing the cat to remove the horns from his feet; when the chase resumes, Tom successfully hides in a corner as Spike rushes off in the other direction, not knowing that Tom got away again. Jerry then turns the same corner as Tom, then retreats to Tyke's cradle; Tom throws out everything in the cradle, including Tyke, to search for the mouse, but Tyke wakes up first. Spike returns and Tom, after unsuccessfully trying to stifle Tyke's hiccups , runs away in fear. Spike tends to the hiccuping pup by giving him water, scaring him and popping a paper bag loudly, which all fail to solve the problem; eventually Spike ends up getting the hiccups too, threatening to kill Tom for it. Next, Tom's final attempt to catch Jerry, who has climbed onto the roof of a house, fails. Tom rests on the guttering, which falls off the house, sending Tom crashing down to the ground . In a cloud of dust, Tom, fearing for his life, digs his own grave. As the dust settles, Spike is about to excavate the cat and carry out his threat, but realizes that both bulldogs are cured of their hiccups due to Tom. Spike is overjoyed, thanks Tom and says that from now on, anything he does is OK with him and Tyke - including chasing Jerry. When Jerry hears this, the mouse goes to his mousehole with his hat and briefcase and puts a sign on his door. Tom runs to the door and reads the sign which says: "Gone South For Sake of Health. - Jerry". Jerry is seen running across a railroad track, which is shown to point south.
