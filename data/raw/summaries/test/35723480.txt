Steve, Skat and other members of a high-ridin', rug-cuttin' musical combo from Oklahoma set off to conquer Broadway, only to find that rhumba-rhythm is all the rage. They decide to sail for Havana to learn the rhythm and pick up the accent, and, on board the ship, Steve meets Rosita Alvarez who is Cuba-bound with her father, Pop Alvarez, a merry confidence man. All have problems they expect to be solved by Madame La Zonga, but they arrive and find that the exotic queen of the rhumba's night club has gone broke. Another confidence man, Beheegan, who has sold a few city halls in his day, provides the answer to everything; using a satchel filled with ill-gotten gains and under the watchful eyes of Alvin, Gabby and Maxwell, he purchases several mythical plantations in South America from Pop.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034196/ Six Lessons from Madame La Zonga
