King Zarkon and the Drule Empire have joined forces to create a mighty space armada named "The Fleet of Doom" with the hopes of striking a critical blow to the Galaxy Alliance by finding and destroying a secret power base. Meanwhile, Haggar has used new magic powers to imprison Princess Alurra's spirit in an alternate dimension. When Keith goes to rescue her, Haggar casts an evil spell that feeds on Keith's past fears of imaginary monsters. King Alfor encourages Keith to overcome his fear with courage. He is then able to find the Princess, but it is Allura who saves his life from Haggar's destructive magic. The Lion Force Voltron and the Vehicle Force Voltron must travel to the secret power base's planet to assist them in fighting off the Fleet, but the journey there is not as easy as it seems for either Voltron Force.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}
