From thousand years ago, the Aztec civilization had praised the male god known as "Quetzalcoatl". Then in 1984, a scientist named Dr. Shepard is studying the culture of Aztec. But in a mysterious ritual done in the eclipse, a screech was heard from the sky and Dr. Shepard screams. The screen then shows a bloodied Dr. Shepard, dead. Detective Harold Kipps investigated, and the natives tell that the killer was Quetzalcoatlus because Dr. Shepard was chosen as the sacrifice. Detective Harold didn't believe them, until he found a sighting of a winged reptilian flying in Philipines. The reptile has a long stretchy neck, and carried a dead deer in its feet. The monster also sighted by a sailor who is sailing towards the Atlantic Ocean, saying it's an enormous reptile, screeching as it flies across the boat. It is possibly 47 meters tall and 131 feet. The sailor, named Joel named the creature "Quetzalcoatl" like the Aztec called the creature. Jimmy Quinn, a young scientist also believed the creature's existence. Commisioner Nick McConell, a police officer also found dead killed in the Californian forests. One night in the same location, Mrs. Pauley, a woman is in her car until she is killed when her car is flipped and destroyed by a mysterious gigantic thing. Finally Lt. Murray Radcliffe, a lieutenant in the SWAT orders his army to investigate. But they end up dead, few survived. The surviving members claimed the murderer was the same giant reptile, meaning Quetzalcoatl was no myth! The creature finally shows up, in London. The Royal Air Force tries to fight the monster, but was destroyed quickly. Right after that, Quetzalcoatl disappeared between the clouds. The news quickly made, about the sightings of the creature. "Giant flying reptile on loose?" "Real Quetzalcoatl Comes" like that. But Quetzalcoatl reappears, this time in New York. The reptile wreaks havoc and eats the innocent civilians, but Jimmy had a plan. He knows Quetzalcoatl is weak of fire. So, Jimmy tells to Captain Fletcher from the military that they had to set grenades. They shoot the grenades using launchers to Quetzalcoatl, and it was successful. The reptile began to burn to death and fell with a terrible screech to the ground from the blue skies, and then was converted into ashes, dead. But, in the deep forests of California, the screech of Quetzalcoatl was heard, signing a new reign of terror!
