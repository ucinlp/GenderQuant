Jack Frost  is the lead singer in a band simply titled "The Jack Frost Band", based in the fictional town of Medford, Colorado, who make their living performing blues covers and an assortment of their own songs in the hope of signing a record deal. He then returns to his son Charlie ([[Joseph Cross , who has just returned from an epic snowball fight against the bully Rory Buck . They spend some quality time by building a snowman in their front yard. Afterward, Jack tucks Charlie into bed and gives him a harmonica, which he tells Charlie he got the day Charlie was born. He then jokes with Charlie, telling him that it's magical, and he'll be able to hear the harmonica wherever he is. Jack promises his wife Gabby  that he will attend his son's hockey game. However, he misses the hockey game in favor of recording the ironically named "Don't Lose Your Faith". Jack then promises to take his family on a Christmas trip to the mountains, but is called in on a gig that could either make or break his career. On his way to the gig, Jack realizes his mistake and borrows his best friend Mac's  car to go home and be with his family. Unfortunately, a bad storm begins to block his view. Due to a faulty windshield wiper on Mac's car, Jack is unable to navigate through the storm, and as a result, he crashes his car, and is killed instantly . One year later, Charlie, depressed over his father's death, withdraws from all contact with his friends. One night, Charlie makes another snowman that bears as much of a resemblance to Jack as he can remember of him and plays Jack's golden harmonica just before going to sleep. This causes the snowman in the front yard to come to life with Jack's voice, memories and personality. Jack attempts to greet Charlie, but ends up terrifying him with his uncanny appearance. Jack walks into the night and contemplates his fate. The next morning, Charlie discovers Jack in his yard and attempts to run away from him. When Charlie winds up in the snowball battlefield, Jack pelts Rory Buck and the other children with snowballs and manages to grab Charlie. Jack escapes with Charlie on a sled whilst Rory and the enraged children pursue them. After losing Rory and the pursuers, Charlie realizes that the snowman is his father and embraces him. Jack befriends Charlie and teaches him the values that he never got to teach him when he was alive. After giving him some hockey lessons, Jack convinces Charlie to rejoin the hockey team instead of continuing to grieve over his death. In the meantime, Mac tries to be a father figure for Charlie. The two gradually bond, while Mac and Gabby slowly develop romantic feelings for each other. Charlie goes on to become the best player on the team. As winter approaches its end, Charlie decides to take Jack to the mountains where it is colder. Charlie attempts to convince his mother to take Jack there, but has a difficult time doing so. Charlie then comes across Rory Buck, who sympathizes with Charlie not having a father  and helps him sneak Jack onto a truck en route to the mountains, where the isolated cabin, that the family was going to stay at a year earlier before Jack's death, stands. Jack calls up Gabby, convinces her that he is Jack Frost and tells her to come to the cabin if she wishes to see Charlie again. Jack tells Charlie that he has to leave. When his wife arrives, the snowman shell dissipates, and Jack becomes an angel. After saying farewell, Jack returns to the afterlife. In the closing moments of the film and one year later, Charlie plays hockey with his friends  while Gabby happily watches, and Mac, now married to Gabby, plays music on the piano.
