The movie opens with Tracey Thurman being rushed to the hospital after being physically assaulted by her husband, Buck. An extended flashback shows how Tracey and Buck met. Tracey was working in a hotel in Florida and came across Buck and his fellow construction workers. At first, Buck was a charming person until over time, he started to display raged tempers, even taking them out on Tracey, and even telling her on how Buck's mother used to abuse him when he was a child. Despite the violent outbursts, she agrees not to leave him. When she tells him that she is pregnant with his child, he punches her in the stomach. She then leaves to go back to Torrington, Connecticut to be with her friends, Judy and Rick, Buck finds her and humbly apologises for what he did and asks to marry her and will settle down in Connecticut. Tracey is hesitant, but when Buck promises never to hit her again, she agrees. After they get married, she gives birth to a boy, named C.J. Buck's attempts to find work seem worthless, the family has no choice but to go back to Florida. Over the next year, Buck manages to gamble away all the money they have, and continues to beat her in front of C.J. Tracey leaves him and returns to Torrington again. Buck shows up and tells her that he found a job at a diner. After Buck steals C.J., she calls the police and Buck is arrested. The police say that she can have her son back if she and Buck got back together. Tracey decides to divorce Buck and she is given custody of her son without Buck seeing him for now. As she leaves, Buck attacks her in her own car. Buck is arrested and Tracey issues a restraining order against him, but he continues to harass her and threatens to kill her. When she goes to the police, they do very little to help. When the divorce is final, he shows up again and she calls the police hoping that when they see him threatening her, they will arrest him. Buck demands that Tracey come out immediately, when he states that he wants them back together, she refuses to stop the divorce. The police show up and Buck pulls out a knife and stabs her numerous times. He then goes into the house and grabs C.J. showing him his mother laying on the ground. Many neighbors witness Buck still assaulting Tracey and the police do nothing to stop it. When she is loaded in the ambulance, they finally apprehend Buck. In the hospital, Tracey's sister and lawyer, Burton Weinstein discuss about filing a lawsuit against the Torrington police department for not protecting Tracey. After months of recovery, Buck is sentenced to 20 years in prison, and could possibly be paroled in 1991. Tracey does not take the news well, knowing when he gets released, he will be coming after her, but Weinstein informs Tracey to remain focused on the lawsuit. Following the trial, the jury votes in favor of Tracey, in that her rights were violated, she is awarded $2,300,000.00 dollars. Happy with the decision, she hugs Weinstein.
