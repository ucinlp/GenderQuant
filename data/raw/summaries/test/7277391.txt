Waldemar Daninsky goes to Tibet to look for proof that the yeti exists. He gets captured by two vampire women in a cave who turn him into a werewolf by biting him. Waldemar's friends are then kidnapped by a band of Tibetan pirates who torture their victims gruesomely, and in the grand climax of the film, Waldemar  gets to fight a genuine Yeti in bloody hand-to-fang combat. Although a yeti is involved in the plot, note it is the two vampire women  who transform Waldemar into a werewolf in this film, thus giving him yet another origin for his lycanthropy! This film involved more nudity and graphic gore than most of Naschy's other Wolfman films.
