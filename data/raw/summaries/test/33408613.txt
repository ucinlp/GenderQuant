The plot is based on eugenics. Madeline Francis  is just about to marry Robert Worthing  when she learns that there is insanity in his family history . Hence they cannot have children lest they surely pass on the madness to their spawn. Madeline begs for the marriage to take place to avoid shame, but she is treated like a sister rather than a bride. Madeline is left to contemplate suicide, but joy returns when Worthing finally learns he was adopted and that they can procreate without fear.<Ref nameQexVAAAAIBAJ&sjid4292,5299950&dqen Lyric offers strong play], The Sunday Chronicle  <ref nameltcNWzVEaEUC&pg%22Married+in+Name+Only%22+1917&hlpk2YTs7rK-Tn0QHti8HoBA&sabook_result&ct2&vedonepage&qfalse American film cycles: the silent era], p. 213-14 <Ref nameIJJVYrnImOsC&pg#vfalse The black stork], p. 135
