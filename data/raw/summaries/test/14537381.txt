A narrator explains that according to Buddhist belief the evolution of birth can be divided into three forms: *Sangsethaca: To be born amongst rot and decay, as a worm or maggot. *Anthaca: To be born from an egg, in the various forms of birds. *Chalaphucha: To be conceived in the womb as a human or other mammal. Then there is a fourth form, Opapatika, which goes against Buddhist beliefs because it involves suicide: a class of supernatural beings who are born out of suicide. However, the powers that they gain also have a negative effect. The narrator, it is revealed, is Thuwachit , the loyal mortal henchman for the elderly Sadok , an Opapatika who is quickly decaying and needs to feast on the flesh of other Opapatikas in order to sustain himself. He sends Thuwachit out to capture others. Four Opapatikas remain: *Paisol , a ruthless assassin who must bear all the scars and wounds of his victims. *Jiras , an immortal Opapatika, and the most powerful of them all. He considers his immortality a curse. *Aruth , an invincible fighter by night, but weak in the daylight. *Ramil , an adrenaline-fueled daredevil who can project a monstrous, ghostly creature to do his bidding. Investigating the Opapatikas is a private detective, Techit , whom Sadok transforms into an Opapatika. Techit has the psychic powers of a mind reader, but his power costs him the use of his five senses. Techit is teamed up with Thuwachit, who leads a vast paramilitary army against the four Opapatika. The four immortals are also mysteriously drawn to a woman, Pran .
