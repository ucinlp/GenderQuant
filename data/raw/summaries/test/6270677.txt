Together with his teenage sister and a horde of orphans, young Guy Maddin lazes away his under-stimulated youth on the mysterious island he will someday inherit. In the lighthouse orphanage in which they all live, their every move is watched over by their overbearing and tyrannical mother while their father, a scientist and inventor, works away secretively in the basement. When new adoptive parents discover mysterious head wounds on their children, teen detective Wendy Hale - one half of a famous brother and sister sleuth team known as the "Lightbulb Kids" - visits the island to launch an investigation. Guy is weak-kneed as he falls for Wendy, however a game of spin the bottle with Sis awakens homosexual feelings in Wendy. She then disguises herself as her sleuth brother Chance. Sis falls for Chance, a love which must be kept from Mother at all costs. As the investigation progresses, the kids are led into the darkest regions of revelation and repression as the terrible secrets of Guy's family are revealed.
