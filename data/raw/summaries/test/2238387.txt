Jake Farris , a country singer stuck in a long-term contract performing at a sleazy urban cowboy nightclub in New York City, boasts to the club's manager, Freddie , that she can make anybody into a country sensation, insisting that she can turn any normal guy into a country singer in just two weeks. Freddie accepts Jake's bet, putting up the remainder of Jake's contract . He then ups the ante: if Jake loses, she must also sleep with him. The problem is that Freddie can select the man, and he selects an obnoxious New York cabbie named Nick Martinelli . Nick not only has no musical talent whatsoever, he claims to hate country music "worse than liver". Realizing she is stuck with Nick, Jake takes him back to the hills of Tennessee for a two-week crash course in how to walk, talk, and sing like a genuine country star.
