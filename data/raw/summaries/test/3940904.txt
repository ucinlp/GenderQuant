Ottar Thor is the star player of the Icelandic football team KR . He is a well liked player who causes a stir when he admits being gay to his team mates and then goes on a journey to discover himself . He soon finds himself on the bench for most of his team's matches and decides to call it quits with KR. He joins a small amateur team mainly made up of men like himself - gay guys trying to play soccer in a straight world. The director of KR, who happens to be Ottar Thor's dad, tries everything in his power to persuade Ottar to come back and play for his team, but the catch is that he needs to get himself back into the closet before playing pro football again. A struggle between father and son starts. Ottar Thor also has a son, a teenager that is not coping too well with all the attention his dad is getting, for all the wrong reasons. Ottar Thor finally gives into his father and returns to KR on the condition that KR plays one match against the gay team. His father accepts this condition, not realising that the match will take place on Gay Pride Day.
