Atouk  is a bullied and scrawny caveman living in "One Zillion BC &ndash; October 9th"Apparently in memory of John Lennon who was killed 5 months before the film's release, was Ringo Starr's friend and bandmate with The Beatles, and whose birthday was October 9. He lusts after the beautiful but shallow Lana , who is the mate of Tonda , their tribe's physically imposing bullying leader. After being banished along with his friend Lar , Atouk falls in with a band of assorted misfits, among them the comely Tala  and the elderly blind man Gog . The group has ongoing encounters with hungry dinosaurs, and rescues Lar from a "nearby ice age", where they encounter an abominable snowman. In the course of these adventures they discover sedative drugs, fire, cooking, music, and learn how to walk fully upright. Atouk uses these advancements to lead an attack on Tonda, overthrowing him and becoming the tribe's new leader. He discards Lana and takes Tala as his mate, and they live happily ever after.
