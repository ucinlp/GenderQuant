After a whole eon, Kremmen has been awarded The Most Fabulous Man in the World Apart from God Award, and is presented with an enormous, fully automated spaceship shaped like a Brain. While Dr. Gitfinger examines the controls, Carla persuades Kremmen to have casual sex with her in their private quarters. On Earth, the United Nations, along with David Frost, hold a secret meeting concerning an unknown matter and decide to alert Kremmen, who is now watching a documentary-film about trawler fishing in the North Sea with Carla. They return to Earth and go to meet the homosexual Head of Universal Security, simply named "Q", who informs Kremmen that planets are disappearing. Along with their new robot Benny, Kremmen and the crew follow what appears to be a giant space-monster  into the Snoop Galaxy, where the ship is swallowed whole by the monster. By pumping the Oxygen reserves into the monster's stomach, the ship is vomited out of the stomach and the crew are saved.
