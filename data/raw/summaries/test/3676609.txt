Everyone on Sesame Street is preparing to celebrate New Year's Eve. However Telly Monster quickly discovers that this means that the current year ends and he is happy with the year as it is. Because he gets afraid that he soon will enter an unknown year, he starts a campaign to prevent the new year to come to Sesame Street. In the meantime, Elmo is the host of the monster news that shows how New Year's Eve is celebrated around the world. This is done by showing segments created by the Sesame characters from the different co-productions around the world. Also, during the special, Wolfgang the Seal balances a beach ball on his nose because he was hired to be the Time Square ball. Near the end of the special, the cast did the countdown and Wolfgang removes the ball in slow motion.
