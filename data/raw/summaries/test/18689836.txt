How betraying a friend or an acquaintance can ruin ones life is poignantly depicted in the Malayalam film Thalappavu made by actor-turned-director Madhupal. The movie is based on a real-life confession of a police constable about gunning down a naxalite in a fake encounter as per the order of his superiors nearly thirty years ago. The screenplay by Babu Janardhanan uses the stream of consciousness flow to show the mental state of the constable who feels deranged after the incident. Lal plays Constable Raveendran Pillai whose family life is ruined after the killing of Joseph , a revolutionary leader fighting for the rights of the hapless farmers of Wayanad. Raveendran is a misfit in the police force as he is not courageous or cruel as the others of his ilk. He is a family man to the hilt and dotes on his children. He befriends Joseph on the way while on duty. Joseph introduces him to the revolutionary ideas. Raveendran takes instant liking for Joseph and roams in the forests with Joseph during his free time.
