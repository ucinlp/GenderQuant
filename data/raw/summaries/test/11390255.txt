Karl pays his girlfriend Julie a surprise visit while she is babysitting her neighbour's children. He brings with him a Ouija board that Julie has been asking to play with. However, unhappy about messing around with the occult, Karl has deliberately left the board at home. Determined to have her way, Julie fashions a makeshift Ouija board out of an innocent child's alphabet toy, and, when Karl is bitten by one of the hamsters, she uses a drop of his blood to consecrate it. The couple then attempt to summon up a spirit, unaware that they have come up with the name of a demon, which arrives in a bolt of lightning, electrocuting the family hamsters and then possessing their dead bodies, turning them into demonic possessed zombie hamsters.
