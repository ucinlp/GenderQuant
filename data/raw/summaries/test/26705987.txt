Swami Amritananda  arrives in Kerala on a mission to bring peace at the state, which is burning with communal riots. Sawimiji, who is worshiped and respected all over the world, receives death threats from different corners. Lakshmi , the district collector, is assigned to look after Swamiji's security. She warns Swamiji about the tensed situation and the dangers waiting him outside. The presence of Lakshmi, who had been the lover of Samiji in his past, brings back old memories to him. Swami Amritananda, in his past life was Shivaprasad, the only son of his mother, who had to undergo unpleasant experiences in her home from her own brother Krishnan Kutty Menon ([[Janardhanan , a police officer, who was loyal to the govt. Communist party in those days was facing strong restrictions from government for its anti-state activities. Shivan had always been a headache for his mother, for his rebellious nature. But Lakshmi, the daughter of Krishnan Kutty Menon was in love with him, which was opposed bitterly by Menon. Shivan, slowly got involved with Communist movement and in short time became their political goonda. Shivan gets involved in several petty crimes and thus invites more anger from his uncle Menon. Karthy, a lady party worker with strong naxalite leanings develops a strong passion towards Shivan, but he is unaware of it. Vasu , his close friend since childhood, is a fun loving character, who always saves Shivan from several issues. Shekharan , the party leader identifies the potential of Shivan and decides to use it maximum for his own personal benefit. Unknowing the shroud tactics by Shekharan, Shivan gets involved in several crimes, one after another. One day, Karthy, in order to separate Lakshmi from Shivan, fabricates a story about her relation with him. She succeeds in making Lakshmi believe about her illicit affair with Shivan. Thinking that Shivan was just double dating her, Lakshmi informs police about Shivan's hideout and he is arrested and sentenced for a couple of years. This incident changes Shivan completely. He turns into a hardcore criminal, and develops a hatred towards Lakshmi. In a couple of years, the political scene in the state changes. Communist Party wins power, and Shivan is released from jail. He is appointed as the secretary of temple Devaswom, and Lakshmi is now an IAS officer, who is now holding the post of Devaswom administrator under Shivan. He tries maximum to belittle her. Shivan, a complete corrupt person, now tries the maximum to loot the temple. The temple staff under Sreekanta Poduval  tries to protest, but ends in vain. Vasu is brought into the temple by Shivan, to create a division among the temple staff. Lakshmi tries to convince Vasu, but he expresses loyalty to Shivan, his close friend, without knowing his corrupt ways or political ambitions. Vasu, with in this time fall for the daughter of Parameshwaran Namboothiri , the head priest of the temple. But she avoids him completely. Vasu, a lower caste by birth, has no chance to win her, who is already engaged to Chitran Namboothiri . Under the instruction of Shekharan, Shivan steals the holy ornaments of the deity and accuses the head priest of stealing it. Vasu, who was on duty that night gives a false statement in the court accusing him. Parameshwaran Namboothiri commits suicide, which gives Vasu a mental shock. He, completely broken by this incident resigns from the job. The persuasion by Shivan was not well enough to block him, instead he even accuses Shivan for the death of Namboothiri. On way back, Vasu also indulges in a war of words with Lakshmi, who tries to abuse Shivan for his crimes. Vasu, under emotion reveals that it was Lakshmi's attitude that had made Shivan a complete criminal. He also asks her to meet Karthy, who is in jail, to know the truth about Shivan. In jail, Karthy reveals her that she had nothing with Shivan, and it was just a fabricated story to fool Lakshmi. Lakshmi, under strong remorse apologizes to Shivan, who now is no mood to listen to her. Shekharan understands the danger, if Vasu reveals the truth about the stolen ornaments in court. He tries to convince Vasu, but fails in doing so. He even threatens to go to police to reveal the truth. To protect himself, Shekharan kills Vasu and dumps his body in the river. Shivan, knowing the death of Vasu, is broken down and in a range attacks Shekharan in the party office. He is jailed by Shekharan and is framed in a false case of killing Vasu. In jail, Shivan undergoes serious mental changes. He transforms completely and adopts spirituality as a remorse for the crimes committed. Upon release, he leaves to North India and undertakes sansyas and adopts the name Swami Amritananda. After long years, now he is back in Kerala. Shekharan, within time has emerged as a strong figure in politics and is the mastermind behind the communal riots. He, plans to finish off Swamiji. Lakshmi arrests several king pins in next day, from whom, gets relevant information about the plan to finish off Swamiji. A dog is send to Swamiji, on which a bomb is tied, and Lakshmi blocks the dog, making it blast, killing herself, but saving Swamiji. He, shocked by this incident decides to give up his sainthood and takes law in hands. Swami Amritananda thus once again becomes Shivan and finishes off Shekharan and his company of evil forces.  *Mohanlal ... Shivaprasad *Jayaram ... Vasu *Revathi ... Lakshmi Menon *M. G. Soman ...
