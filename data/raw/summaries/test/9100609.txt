A drug deal gone bad results in biologically engineered marijuana being delivered to the Strip-O-Sauraus, a run-down strip club known for giant dinosaur statues in its parking lot. Club owner Ralph Vivino  is worried over its appearance, because if anything goes wrong at the club on his watch, his rival will take his job. Cockroaches fed on the tainted pot and mutate to become bloodthirsty, giving Ralph and the clubâ€™s dancers, Crystal , Teresa , and Trix  immediate problems as the bugs infest the club, sucking blood and causing mayhem. Ralph calls an ineffectual exterminator, "Buzz" O'Reilly , who then enlists the help of Crystal who has received a nasty bug bite. Buzz's strongest chemicals cannot stop the carnivorous insects and the entire club falls under attack. A DEA agent arrives to destroy both the shipment and the mutated bugs, but unwittingly helps the bugs mutate further.
