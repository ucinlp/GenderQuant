Jimmy Connors, a student at Riverwood High School, also plays the drums in the school band, but dreams of playing in a dance band. He and his "pal" Mary Holden, sell the school principal the idea of forming the band and putting on a dance. The principal is initially doubtful, but then agrees to buy the first ticket. The event is a success and the school's debt for the instruments in paid off. Famous band leader, Paul Whiteman  sponsors a contest in Chicago for the best high school musical group, and Jimmy decides that the band must compete. In three weeks, the kids write, plan and put on a show . The melodrama called 'Nell from New Rochelle', is also a success and raises the money to go to Chicago, but they're still short. A loan from Paul Whiteman himself deals with that obstacle. But when Willie, a member of the cast, is injured and needs a critical and urgent operation, the band give the money up so that Willie can be flown to Chicago for the operation. The band raise the money anyway, compete in Chicago and win the $500 prize. To Jimmy goes the honour of leading all the bands in a grand finale performance.
