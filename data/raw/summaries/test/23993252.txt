During one particular risky robbery heist, Leo breaks the window at a jewelry store only to have his wrists broken by a gate falling. He is soon caught and brought to prison to serve his term. Throughout his stay, Leo does not reveal who he is working for to the authorities but instead serves his time angered by Gus for running out on him during the robbery. When Leo is released he returns to Gus to obtain a job. Gus harshly rebuffs him and points out how Leo’s injured wrists would prevent him from working as a thief. This leads to Leo to seek complete vengeance against Gus. He decides to frame Gus for murder by stealing his gun and murdering a cab driver. He manages to provide himself with an alibi to avoid any prosecution. During this scheme he meets Carol Dane  who is unaware of his true nature. The two begin a romance. Later, he confronts Gus with the understanding that if he does not give Leo money, Leo will hand over the gun to the police.

Meanwhile, Leo learns that Detective Inspector Rogers is investigating the murder case. He attempts to assure Rogers that he is attempting to live a life away from crime but Rogers continues to question Leo’s character and whereabouts during the night of the murder. Things begin to go downhill when Leo and Gregory learn that it was actually Gregory’s gun that was used rather than Gus’. Gregory becomes upset and has his companion plot to murder Gus while forcefully threatening Leo. Leo’s wrists are crushed again but he and Gus reach a deal for Leo to bring back the gun and steal a jewel. All the while, Rogers uncovers more and more clues. When Leo steals the jewel and brings back the gun to Gregory, a gunfight ensues leaving Gregory dead. As Leo jumps on the train to run away with Carol, she confronts him about his lies. Soon after, Rogers arrives after finally learning that Leo murdered the cab driver.
