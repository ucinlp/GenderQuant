Arun Prajapati  has been trying to be a successful TV anchor, but success has always eluded him. He blames God  for this lack of success. Arun is head over heels in love with Aaliya Khanna, who is a TV anchor and a well-known star working in the same channel, but he has never been able to express his love for her. When Rocky  is appointed as an anchor for the channel, Arun starts believing that Rocky will win Aaliya. Later, Arun is sacked from the channel. He has nobody to blame but God Himself, whom he later meets in person. An argument ensues between the two, at the end of which God then decides to give Arun the power over all things for ten days, wherein Arun may prove that he is a better operator of the universe. Arun then uses this power to put Rocky into an uneasy spot and win Aaliya's heart. After God scolds him for only making things better for himself, Arun starts listening to people's prayers. He later realizes that considering each person's wishes individually would be too time-consuming, so to save time and effort he grants everybody's wishes, including the wish of criminals to be free, and the Rocky's wish that Aaliya marries him. He later asks God why is everything happening towards him. God explains it is his own fault and that everyone cannot blame Him for this. Arun feels bad, but God forgives him and starts his life over again. During the game show, he tricks Rocky into lying about loving Aaliya Khanna, and Aaliya turns on him. Arun wins the heart of Aaliya.
