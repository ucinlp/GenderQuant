Milton Parker , an elderly and eccentric game inventor, dies in the opening scene after losing a video game with his seductive nurse . The Sunday morning following his death and funeral, all of his greedy and estranged relatives show up at his mansion for the reading of his will where his lawyer Charles Bernstein  stipulates in his will that the winner of an elaborate scavenger hunt will inherit his $200 million estate. The various  beneficiaries form five teams and each team gets involved in various misadventures along the way. The five teams consist of... # Parker's son-in-law Henry Motley  and his four ill-behaved children. # The servants; French cook Henri , manservant Jenkins , limo driver Jackson , and dull-witted French maid Babbette . # Dim-witted taxi driver Marvin Dummittz . # Parker's greedy widowed sister Mildred Carruthers , her greedy attorney Stewart Sellsome , and her spoiled, man-child son Georgie . # Nephews Kenny  & Jeff Stevens , and Lisa, Carruthers' step-daughter . The five groups are given five lists containing simple and easy clues to acquire 100 items with various point values ranging from five to 100 points. The items are to be acquired by any means necessary, with the exception of purchase, and placed in five different pens on the grounds of the estate. The winner of the scavenger hunt will be the person or team that acquires the most points, by 5:00 p.m. that very day. What follows is a series of misadventures as each of the five groups attempts to acquire the various items, as well as returning occasionally to the Parker mansion to deposit items in the team pen under the supervision of Bernstein and the scorekeeper Mr. Cornfeld. Mildred, Stewart and Georgie's adventure has them trying to win a stuffed toy bear at a local carnival, trying to haul a heavy safe out of Stewart's office building, stealing the false teeth of a local Native American  as well as resorting to stealing other people's items. Stewart also gets roughed up by a group of motorcycle gang members, led by a burly guy named Scum  after attempting to steal a stuffed fox tail from one of the bikers' motorcycles. The servants' adventure has them trying to steal a toilet from a fancy hotel, partaking in a robbery at a local convenience store to steal a cash register , and getting locked in a university laboratory to steal a microscope. Kenny, Jeff and Lisa's adventure has them "borrowing" items such as a clown head from a local Jack in the Box eatery, recruiting an obese man named Duane  as an item since the list gives 50 bonus points for the team with the heaviest person, but they soon discard him  and pick up another obese person, and borrowing a bulletproof vest from a self-defense-obsessed elderly lady named Arvila , acquiring "laughing gas", stealing a uniform from a local motorcycle cop, and getting stuck in a locker room during a major league football game after trying to steal a football helmet. Marvin Dummittz' adventure has him trying unsuccessfully to steal a Rolls Royce front grill and getting run over many times attempting to remove it. Marvin teams up with a bridal shop security guard named Sam , who catches him attempting to steal a bridal dress. Marvin tells him about the scavenger hunt and Sam agrees to help. Together they try to steal a knight's suit of armor from a local museum, with Marvin dressing up as a mummy and Sam putting the suit on. He gets knocked out and the Mildred-Stewart-Georgie team steal him. Marvin teams up with an obese friend of his named Merl  to help him. Henry Motley's adventure has him attempting to make his unruly kids proud of him by trying to acquire a beehive , a life preserver , and a parachute . Motley tries to get a medicine ball from a local gym and tries to impress the instructor Lars , which gets Motley thrown out of a second floor window after he finally attempts to catch a medicine ball thrown to him. In the meantime, each of the five teams steals an ostrich from the San Diego Zoo, much to the dismay of the bewildered zookeeper . It all leads to a climactic car chase back to the Parker mansion where the servants, Motley and kids, and Marvin all team up, giving up their individual chances to win in order to help Jeff and Kenny win the scavenger hunt. They haul all their items to the Stevens brothers' pen to allow them to win against the unethical Mildred-Stewart-Georgie team. It ends when, with seconds to go, Sam, still wearing the armored knight suit, has to crawl out of the Carruthers' pen and into the Stevens' pen to win the contest for the Stevens brothers and Lisa, who decide to share their new wealth with the rest of the participants, with the exception of the Mildred-Stewart-Georgie team.
