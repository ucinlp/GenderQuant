The film tells the story of the original Rin Tin Tin, the legendary German Shepherd, found shortly before the end of World War I by American serviceman Lee Duncan as a shell-shocked puppy in a bombed-out dog kennel in Lorraine, France. The dog was taken to America and became the hero of several films made in the 1920s and 1930s.{{cite web}}
