Sach convinces Louie to rent the back room of the sweet shop to a professor. Meanwhile Slip is preoccupied with entering their car in an auto race to raise enough money to help Louie pay his bills. They don't have any luck with the car until Sach invents a formula that makes the car go faster. A crooked gambler tries to steal the formula from them, with no luck. Slip enters into another race, but has to start the race without the formula in the car as Sach was making another batch. When Sach reaches him in the middle of the race and puts the formula in the gas tank the cars begins to accelerate...only in reverse! Sach and Slip then continue the race in reverse and wind up winning. Sach then realizes why the formula didn't work as it did before...the seltzer that he added to the formula was flat!
