White Eagle, a Pony Express Rider, is the son of a massacred Army officer who has been raised by an Indian tribe. He believes himself to be the son of the tribal chief, and is working to get a peace treaty signed between the Indians and the white settlers. But 'Dandy' Darnell, a notorious and merciless outlaw, tries to keep the fight alive by sending his henchmen to stir up trouble, partly due to his wish to grab hundreds of thousands of acres in the western territories for himself and also to incite a war with the Indians along the territory. This serial was inspired by the 1932 movie of the same name, again starring Buck Jones in the title role.
