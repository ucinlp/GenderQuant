Ram : In a gorgeous place stays a sanyasi - a religious minded young man who runs away from the wedding nupitals. Aarti : Today's Menaka. Yesterday's Menaka tried to disturb Vishwamitra's communion with god and today's Menaka Aarti tries to distract Ram's mind away from his religious thoughts. She adopts many disguises and agrees to do what one least expects a noble, attractive and good girl like her to attempt. Renuka Devi : Ram's mother. Her husband ruined his life while he was still young, because of drinking and womanising. Not wanting her son to be like his father, she has kept Ram surrounded by a religious atmosphere since his childhood. The result is that Ram grows up to be different from all other young men - a true sanyasi. Girdhari and Banwari: The robbers. They have entered Ram's house in disguise as his uncle and cousin, posing as father and son. They have taken the place of Renuka Devi's brother and his son who died in a train accident. Ram's mother embraces them as her long separated brother and nephew, but does not know that these two devils are here to swindle her belongings and happiness. Shanti Baba: A true sanyasi. Who can kill the soul that lives only to bring happiness to others? The most unforgettable screen character you will ever come across, the true sanyasi who lays down his life in order to rescue a helpless woman from the clutches of Mangal Singh. Ishwar Baba: A fraud, a blot on the very noble trible of a saffron-clad sanyasi. He is, in fact, evil dacoit Mangal Singh, a murderer, rapist and drunkard. But in day time he poses as a racluse and pretends to perform miracles to impress the unsuspecting devotees.
