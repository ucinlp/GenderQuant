25 years after the events of the first film, the minor-league hockey team Charlestown Chiefs are still languishing in Pennsylvania. A new player/coach, Sean Linden , has taken over from Reggie Dunlop, and the team's violence has become the Chiefs' hallmark as Sean Linden does not try to control the "fighting hockey" trio of the Hanson Brothers. After only 10 wins in two years the team is bought by a family entertainment corporation called Better America, run by an executive named Richmond Claremont . The team is moved to Nebraska and given a new  coach. The team soon finds out that Richmond Claremont intends to use the Chiefs as the team which plays and loses in scripted games against a Harlem Globetrotters type team named the Omaha IceBreakers in an attempt by Claremont to make the game suitable for a family audience. The "Super Chiefs" lose the Hanson brothers when a fight breaks out between the two teams. After the fight Claremont bribes Linden to change the team's attitude and then leave. Linden succeeds into talking the Chiefs into supporting the "fake" game for higher pay and better exposure. He then leaves. He comes back after remembering his love for the game and talks the "Super Chiefs" into their old ways. The Chiefs with the Hanson brothers back begin crushing the Icebreakers. The Chiefs win and Claremont is furious and threatens to sue, but can't because he no longer owns the Chiefs... the recent lottery winning Hanson Brothers do. The movie ends with the Hansons saying the team is going to play the great old-time hockey like Eddie Shore, Dit Clapper, Toe Blake, and Gordie Howe.
