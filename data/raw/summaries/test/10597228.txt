In 1983 Don Robson  started a boys football team called Athletico Greenwich. Twenty years later six of the lads are still playing for the team, but things have become so much more complicated.  Cass , the team's top scorer on and off the pitch, isn't sure he's ready for fatherhood with Kate , the love of his life. Adam  still hasn't told the rest of the team he's gay. Colin  is desperate to have a threesome even though he's just started going out with the lovely Vicky . Dylan  is in love with the woman his father is about to marry. Billy  is trying to save his marriage. Johnny  is not ready to accept the fact that his father, who started the team all those years ago, is dying. Whilst it is the Sunday football team that keeps this group of friends together, this is not a film about football. This is a film about complex relationships, and how childhood friends have to change as they mature.'Channel 4 Film Review', Clare Poland, June 2006
