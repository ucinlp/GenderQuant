In the heart of San Francisco, the legions of the damned lay waiting beneath the Golden Gate Bridge. As night falls, they are unleashed upon the city to carve terror into the souls of the innocent. But when one young woman named Natalie  escapes a bloody teen slaughter, she cannot convince anyone that a rampaging army of psychotic 'monsters' has mutilated her friends. Now haunted, hunted and having a hard time in high school, Natalie must arm herself and her classmates for one final bizarre battle against the horror of the "neon maniacs." Some of the scenes were filmed at Hollywood High School.
