Daffy is plucked for stardom by director Harvey Hassenpfeffer of Colossal Studiosâ€”or so he thinks. However, as he was in A Star Is Bored , Daffy's real fate is to be the stunt man for the star, in this case Speedy Gonzales. The picture is The Nursery Rhyme Review. First, "the sky is falling"; next, the "rockabye baby" cradle falls from a treetop. Daffy realizes he needs to get rid of Speedy, so he asks for an autograph and traps Speedy in a book, which he deposits in a library. Daffy gets the love scene with Ducky Lamour, but after a number of stunts and just before the kiss, his stand-in, Speedy, takes over.
