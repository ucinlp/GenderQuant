After achieving much fame and glory from smashing the cotton mill, Shaolin hero Hu Hui-Chien has become the people's champion and the sworn enemy of the Ching government. So enraged are they, that they employ the best fighters from the Wu Tang. A leg fighter named Ko, whose "Flash Northern Legs" are undefeated in the whole of China, travels to Canton at the invitation of the Ching government to kill Shaolin master Hu Hui-Chien. This leads to the classic northern kicks vs. southern fist duel.
