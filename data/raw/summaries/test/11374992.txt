That cartoon takes place in Naples, where Tom and Jerry arrive aboard a cruise ship. Tom and Jerry's usual antics lead to an Italian mouse, Topo, defending Jerry from Tom's attacks. Topo, in Italian, says he dislikes it when a larger creature picks on a smaller creature, which he proves when he saves Tom from being attacked by an Italian dog. When Topo sees the familiar faces and realises exactly who Tom and Jerry are. Being a fan of their cartoons, Topo befriends them, shows them the sights and treats them to local delicacies. But the Italian dog, along with two of his canine friends, follows behind and they eventually confront Topo. However, with the help of some very large cheeses that send the dogs into the Bay of Naples, Tom, Jerry, and Topo emerge victorious, just before Tom and Jerry's boat departs. Before they leave, Tom shakes Topo's hand, Jerry hugs him, and as they leave on the ship back to the United States, they are bid farewell by Topo and, surprisingly, the three defeated dogs.
