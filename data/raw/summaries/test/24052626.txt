The film focuses on a group on three Hollywood wives and their complicated lives. Lissa Roman is a very successful actress and musician busy promoting her latest blockbuster movie. She is fed up with her younger husband, Gregg Lynch, who seems to be interested only in her money and luxurious life style. Her two best friends include Taylor Singer and Kyndra. Taylor is the wife of the well known director Larry Singer. Frustrated that she is unable to have her big break, she has an affair with the much younger writer Oliver Rock. Lissa's other friend Kyndra is meanwhile enjoying a career as a soul singer, often described as a selfish diva. This has negative impact on the relationship with her daughter Saffron, an aspiring fashion designer and best friend of Nikki Roman, Lissa's daughter. When assigned to private investigator Michael Scorsinni, she finds out that her husband is cheating on her. When she arrives home and refuses to talk to him, he becomes angry, beating her up and raping her. After throwing him out of the house the next morning, she attends a dinner party of Nikki, who will marry Evan Richter in a month. She is glad to marry him, but she also has a secret crush on his brother Brian. She later kisses him at a night club, but immediately regrets the decision. Meanwhile, Lissa is bothered there by a man and eventually has to be escorted home by Michael. Gregg spots them walking together and suspects the worst. Later that night, Lissa notices that Gregg is spreading false rumours about her on national television. The next morning, Taylor is offered the lead in a movie about a lesbian love story. Her Larry disapproves of the script and is annoyed by his wife's obsession with Hollywood. Always having aspired a normal life, he regrets that his wife doesn't interact well with people who aren't familiar with Hollywood. Trying to prevent her from taking the role, he agrees to help her finally make her own movie. She is very lucky, until she finds out Oliver is assigned as her script writer. Larry soon finds out that she knew him before their meeting and suspects that they are having an affair. Meanwhile, Nikki gets kidnapped. Saffron and Brian are worried by her disappearance, but Evan doesn't really care, as he is too busy with his mistress. After the premiere of her latest movie, Lissa spends the night with Michael. They are interrupted by the message of Nikki's abduction. The kidnapper, a poor man who was angry that Lissa received a salary of $15,000,000 for one movie, demands $5,000,000. As she hands him the money, he runs away, without Nikki anywhere to be seen. Michael eventually saves the day, by catching the kidnapper and locating Nikki. In the end, Lissa promises Nikki to spend more time with her. Nikki ends her engagement with Evan to marry Brian. Larry finds out about Taylor's affair with Oliver and files for divorce, after which she decides to take the role in the movie about lesbians. Kyndra shows Saffron for the first time how much she cares about her.
