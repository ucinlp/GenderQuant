Woody drops in at a fancy restaurant, but sorely undertips the waiters. Insulted, they toss him out without a bite to eat. Tired of living without a dollar to his name, Woody starts thumbing through the newspaper, and sees an ad about a wealthy lady seeking matrimony who goes by the name Gorgeous Gal. Desperate but optimistic, Woody calls Gorgeous Gal and hears a sultry voice on the other end of the phone. She tells him that she loves Woodpeckers, he is the only thing on her mind and she invites her "dream boy" to come over. Ecstatic, he rushes over to the woman's huge mansion to meet her. The spring in his step is all but shattered when he finally gets a good look at her: Gorgeous Gal is an overweight, heavily jeweled and overdressed bird who is much older than Woody. Upon hearing the words "Hello cutie pie. Your Gorgeous Gal is waiting," Woody's feathers turn white and he passes out.  Deflated, Woody makes a mad dash for the door, but not after trying to eat as much food as he finds. Conversely, Gorgeous Gal has fallen madly in love with Woody at first sight and actively pursues him for the rest of his visit. Gorgeous manages to steal a few kisses from Woody with her big red puckered lips and attempts to seduce him at every turn. Such attempts involve Gorgeous Gal hiking up her skirt to reveal her skinny crossed legs and saying "Cheesecake?" She also appears before Woody in a bubble bath with her body covered in bubbles. Despite her using a rather enticing voice while saying things like "Sweetie," "Silly boy," "I'm waiting," "Honey Lamb," and "How 'bout a twosome, hon," Woody still finds her unattractive. He tries to lose her in the mansion, but to no avail. Her beloved bolts out of the mansion and swims out to a small island in the sea. Eventually, Gorgeous Gal gets Woody to marry her, reluctantly. The newlywed couple sails off to their honeymoon in a submarine.
