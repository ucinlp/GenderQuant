Comic book artist Sophie  is a sweet and carefree girl brimming with creativity. She and her handsome surgeon boyfriend of two years, Jeff , are the perfect couple. After his marriage proposal to her in front of her family and all of her friends, Sophie is the happiest person in the world. One day, Jeff meets a famous movie star, Joanna , during a surgical procedure. Immediately afterwards, he breaks up with Sophie. Devastated, Sophie takes to bed. She is unable to face anyone, especially her mother who had been planning the wedding. Sophie decides to cover up the break-up, with only her 2 best friends, Lucy  and Lily  knowing the truth. She comes up with a master plan: she will use the remaining two months before the wedding date to do whatever it takes to get Jeff back. She also plans to publish her many strategies in her new comic book. She wants to show women everywhere how to use a 'scientific' approach to win love back. Sophie's first strategy of "Generosity and Forgiveness" does not go well. At a Halloween party, hosted by Gordon , a photographer, she drowns her sorrows in alcohol. She stumbles upon a photo of Gordon and Joanna together which immediately gives her the idea of forming an alliance with him, believing they were lovers. Gordon agrees to become Sophie's partner and her quest for revenge becomes a roller coaster of farcical twists and turns. Soon after a Christmas party at Gordon's place, Joanna reveals to Sophie that she has never lost Jeff at all and asked Gordon to keep an eye on her. It was then revealed that he and Joanna are actually siblings because he's been taking care of her since they were young. Feeling betrayed, Sophie gives up the notions of love and tells Gordon to leave her alone. Her mother then learns the truth and is finally able to convince her to give love another chance. Sophie calls off her relationship with Jeff and goes to visit Gordon, but he has already left for Europe. Joanna is there and tells her that during that time, he fell in love with Sophie. She reunites with Gordon and Little San-hei in Europe.
