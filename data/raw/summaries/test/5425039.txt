Inside a penny arcade, Donald inserts a coin to play a Mutoscope entitled "Dance of the Seven Veils". The pictures show dances of Daisy Duck looking dancer until Donald's viewing is rudely interrupted by bad frames. Next Donald tries out a crane machine to win a camera, but he comes up empty handed. Then Donald goes on a coin operated airplane ride, but his ride is very short. When he tries to get another ride for free, the plane goes out of control, Donald nearly getting caught in the airplane propellers and becoming airsick. With that, Donald leaves the arcade.
