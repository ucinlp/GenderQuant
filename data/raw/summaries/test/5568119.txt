Set in the Korean War, this movie depicts the atrocities of battle. In the film, Sgt. Garth, an egomaniacal, blood thirsty leader neglects to tell his soldiers that there has been a cease fire. The Sergeant sends his unit into an enemy bunker, where they are fiercely attacked by the enemy. The few who survive secure the bunker, and Garth attempts to take credit for their actions. Further chaos ensues, resulting in the deaths of many in the platoon, as well as the mortal wound to the Sergeant himself. Tagline: "The iron-guts guys who kill for medals... dames... or just to stay alive!"
