The story is told from the viewpoint of Danny Bonaduce, narrated by Bonaduce himself and played on-screen by a pre-Desperate Housewives Shawn Pyfrom. Upon landing the coveted role of Danny Partridge, young Bonaduce must contend with the jealousy of his abusive father Joseph ; all the while, Danny is a sidelines observer of the effect that overnight stardom has on his co-worker David Cassidy , who despises all the idolatry and yearns for a normal life. The film recounts the surrogate son-surrogate father relationship between Danny and actor Dave Madden , who was genuinely fond of his younger costars despite the kid-hating irascibility of his "Reuben Kincaid" character. The film's highlight, which would be impossible to believe if it was not corroborated by witnesses, is the scene where Cassidy impulsively "kidnaps" Danny, whereupon both boys head off on a short journey of self-discovery; less easy to swallow is the scene which contrives a feud between the "Partridge" cast and the actors on the rival series The Brady Bunch .
