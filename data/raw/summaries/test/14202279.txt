A man on a crowded metro train gathers the attention of the passengers in his train car, saying that he has an announcement to make. The passengers at first seem to think that the man is one of the typical train-entertainers that frequent metro trains. But the man says that he is simply looking for love. He says that he is well off, educated, and not unattractive, and that he is simply looking for someone to share life's precious moments with. After a long speech , the man says that any interested women should get off at the next stop. A woman  promptly stands up as soon as the train slows down, and steps off to the platform. Obviously excited, she is waiting for the man to step off to join her. As she stares his way, the man tells her through the closing train door, "Miss, it was only a sketch..." The train doors shut and train speeds off leaving the woman standing alone and dejected on the platform. The screen cuts to black and the man's voice is heard saying, "We hope you enjoyed the show. A small contribution would be most welcome."
