After orchestrating a robbery, bank Vice President Jeremy Stanton  gets lost driving in the desert, en route to meeting his family with a deadline of eight hours. He listens to tapes by a lifestyle guru  and seeks help from a telephone route-finding service, which gives him guidance that does not agree with his map. At first it seems as if he has succeeded in the perfect crime, but things quickly deteriorate – he is pursued by one of his fellow robbers , a ruthless killer whom he double crossed; his wife begins to doubt the choices they've made; he attempts to turn himself in to a state trooper, who is found dead by his pursuer's hand – and self-doubt plagues him. The film is almost a solo performance, with few other characters except Stanton and Judy , the woman from the telephone route-finder service, and tension builds in a Kafka-esque style as it becomes clear that things are not what they seem. Ultimately, it is revealed that Judy has been paid by his pursuers to lead him into a trap. He is surrounded and one of his pursuers taps on the window as the movie ends.
