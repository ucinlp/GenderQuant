Four men, members of a Welsh rugby union club, fly to Paris as part of a weekend outing to see Wales play France in the Five Nations Championship match that will decide the Grand Slam title. One of the party is Caradog Lloyd-Evans , who briefly served in occupied Paris near the end of World War II. Caradog pays for his son Glyn's air ticket on the proviso that Glyn comes on a 'pilgrimage' to find his 'little butterfly' who he spent a short romantic period with during the war. This pilgrimage is successful and although the right place is found, it is no longer the innocent bistro of his youth but one of many strip club joints. Mr Lloyd-Evans mistakes a young girl in the club  for the real thing and finds that the girl is actually Odette , the daughter of his old flame. He is  disappointed but Glyn  gets himself acquainted with Odette while Caradog reminisces with his 'butterfly' . A quick call to the hotel brings the entire tour party to the club where fun and frolicking takes place led by Mog . Some locals take exception and a mass brawl starts which ends with the arrival of the police. The whole party is arrested except Caradog  and Glyn . Sion Probert plays camp boutique owner Maldwyn Pugh, who is the only one of the main four characters who makes the start of the match, because Mog is still in jail as he was considered the ringleader , Caradog is with his 'butterfly' and Glyn is trying for his own sexual 'Grand Slam' with Odette. Mog is eventually released halfway through the first half of the match, but when he finally arrives at the stadium, there's only seconds of the game left, which Wales lose. Caradog is found collapsed near the table, and Madame thinks he has died, but Odette fires a soda siphon on his face, and the story ends with Caradog warning his son of the dangers of overseas travel.
