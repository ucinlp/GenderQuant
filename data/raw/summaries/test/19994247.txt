 Yogi and Boo Boo are two brown bears who have a penchant for stealing picnic baskets from visitors to Jellystone Park, while park rangers Smith and Jones try to prevent them from doing so. Meanwhile, Rachel, a nature documentary maker, arrives at the park to make a film about Yogi as a rare example of a talking bear. To this end she fits Boo Boo with a bow tie containing a miniature camera, so she can get footage of Yogi in his natural habitat. Meanwhile, Mayor R. Brown realizes that Franklin City is facing bankruptcy due to profligate spending on his part. To solve it and fund his election campaign to be the next governor, the mayor decides to select Jellystone as a logging site, and Jellystone is prepared to be shut down. To save the park from being shut down, Ranger Smith holds a Centennial festival where he hopes to make a profit selling Season Passes. To sabotage the effort, Mayor Brown plays on Ranger Jones' desire to be head ranger and promises him the position if the funds are not raised. Yogi had promised Smith to stay out of sight during the festival, but Jones convinces him to go ahead with the helping plan. Yogi tries to please the crowd with a waterskiing performance which goes awry when he inadvertently sets his cape on fire. In the ensuing chaos, the fireworks Smith set up are knocked over and ignited prematurely, launching them into the assembled audience who flee in a panic. After Jellystone is shut down, Ranger Smith is forced to stay in Evergreen Park, a small urban enclave choked with litter and pollution, but not after he tells Yogi that Yogi is not as smart as he thinks he is. Now seeing that their home is in danger of being destroyed, Yogi and Boo Boo travel to Evergreen Park, where Smith places the clues that Mayor Brown had given him, that Brown and his chief of staff, are planning to cut down Jellystone and its trees, to make money. They come back to Jellystone, and along with Rachel plan to stop the sale of the park. They learn that Boo Boo's pet frog-mouthed turtle is a rare and endangered species, which means that the Park cannot be destroyed with the frog-mouthed turtle there. Ranger Jones also teams up with them, after reforming when he learns Mayor Brown's plans for Jellystone. Mayor Brown captures the frog-mouthed turtle with help from his guards and tells his Chief of Staff to take it away, knowing that if it is no longer in the Park there is nothing to stop him cutting down the trees. He confesses his plan to shut down the park to Yogi and the others. However, after Mayor Brown begins his press conference, Rachel realises that the camera in Boo Boo's bow tie has been filming the whole time and has captured the Mayor's confession. The turtle escapes from Brown's Chief of Staff by using his frog-like tongue to pull itself through the car window and out into the park. With Yogi and Boo-Boo distracting the security guards, Ranger Smith connects Boo Boo's camera to the jumbotron and Brown's confession is played to the assembled members of the press, and Brown and his guards are arrested by police officers. Brown's chief of staff attempts to run off, but Rachel pins him to the ground using what she learned from her time living with snow leopards. Smith resumes his post as head ranger, and he and Rachel admit their romantic feelings about each other. Jones works on the park's entrance booth, handing out leaflets about the rare frog-mouthed turtle to the vastly increased number of visitors, while Yogi and Boo Boo are stealing picnic baskets once again with Ranger Smith and Rachel in pursuit.
