Buster plays a down on his luck young man who decides to commit suicide after losing his job and his girl. After several inept attempts to end his life - and bolstered by whiskey disguised as poison - he joins an expedition to capture an armadillo. Buster finds himself becoming more confident through a series of adventures  as the film proceeds. The confidence becomes his undoing as he misses the pool in a dive from a high board and hits the ground on the far side with such force that he disappears into a hole. Some years later, an Asian-garbed Buster climbs out of the hole in the now dry and deserted pool followed by a Chinese wife and two young children.
