On the occasion of her 65th birthday, a crotchety hypochondriac  goes through her daily rant as her snooty servants ply her with colorful but unnecessary pills. Her "celebration" is interrupted when a toy plane owned by the gang crashes through her dining room window and shatters a vase. Forced to do the old lady's yardwork to pay for the damage, the kids ever so gradually win her heart, mostly by refusing to mollycoddle her as her servants have done for so many years. Before long, the gang's new "Grandma" is singing along with Spanky and Alfalfa, demolishing her pill bottles with a slingshot, embarking upon a wild roller-skate ride through her drafty mansionâ€”and having the time of her life in the process.
