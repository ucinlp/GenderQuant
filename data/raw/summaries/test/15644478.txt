On graduation day at Buffalo Glenn High School in Tacoma, Washington, valedictorian Denis Cooverman  confesses his love for head cheerleader and long time crush, Beth Cooper  in his speech while also taunting a girl, Valli Wooley , with an eating disorder, an ignorant bully, Beth's Army soldier boyfriend Kevin ; and urging his best friend Rich Munsch ([[Jack Carpenter  to admit he is gay. Afterwards, Denis invites Beth and her friends, Cammy  and Treece , to a party he has planned at his house. At Denis' house, his parents leave with his father  revealing that he has condoms upstairs. Beth, Cammy, and Treece arrive at Denis’ house for the party. Kevin comes with his Army buddies vowing revenge on Denis. They attempt to beat Denis up, but it results in Denis, Beth, Rich, Cammy, and Treece running away in Beth's car. They drive to a gas station hoping to get beer, but are told by the convenience store clerk  that they can not buy it as he would not accept the driver’s license Beth gave him which stated that she was 37 years old. So Beth bribes the clerk with a kiss. He accepts, which makes Denis realize that she is not who he thinks she is. They then start a bonfire in an isolated section of town where Rich, Cammy, and Treece are chased by a stampede of cows after trying to tip one over. Denis then puts on the song "Beth" by KISS and is told that she was named after that song. They all get in Beth’s Yaris and drive without lights. They then stumble upon Denis' father and mother  having sex in their car by crashing into them. Rather than facing Denis’ parents, Beth decides to drive them away unseen to a private party at Valli Wooley’s house, encountering Kevin once again. Kevin challenges Denis to a fight as Beth crashes his car into a wall of the house. They drive away in Kevin’s Hummer H2 to the empty Buffalo Glenn High School and enter the school using Beth’s head cheerleader key. After showcasing their cheerleading routine, Beth, Treece, and Cammy decide to run to the girls' locker room to take a shower. Kevin and his buddies appear in the locker room as Denis is undressing to join his friend and the girls in the shower. Rich challenges Kevin and his friends in towel whipping as he has been training for years after being towel whipped at a young age. They escape to Treece's father's cabin in Beth's Yaris where Rich, Treece, and Cammy have a threesome as Beth and Denis have their first kiss together. They head to Denis' house afterwards where his parents punish him for leaving the house a mess. Beth says goodbye to Denis, gives him a kiss, and thanks him for loving her. Denis promises that he will see her at their fifth high school reunion and if they are both still single that he will marry her. After Beth leaves with Treece and Cammy, Rich proclaims to Denis that he might be homosexual or bisexual. Denis informs Rich that he was just playing about waiting until the reunion to talk to Beth again. He tells Rich that he is going to leave Beth a message on Facebook and ask her out. Rich disagrees with him and tells Denis that he should make a grand gesture by going to her house with a boom box and wait for her. They then begin debating on how Denis should go about asking Beth on a date.
