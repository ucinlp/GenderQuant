The show is about two friends from Union, Ohio, named Derrick  and Will ([[Paul Campbell , who send a home video to every network, claiming they can produce a better sitcom than the ones currently being broadcast. The WB takes them up on this offer. Derrick and Will are taken to The WB studios, where they meet the head of The WB, Jeff Tucker , Creative VP Roy Ingold , and Tucker's assistant, whom he introduces as Jill Something . Tucker tells them to create their own sitcom, while working in various sitcom-related sets. In addition, a reality show will be made about their sitcom's birth. Thus, the pair has a camera crew following them around The WB studios, when they are not on the sets, and a live studio audience, when they are working on the sets. After setting the scene, the rest of the episode focuses on Derrick and Will's first day trying to come up with a sitcom. Over the course of the episode, they hire Jill Something as their assistant and make a pity-hire of Mandy , who had just been fired from The WB gift shop. Meanwhile, Tucker and Ingold interfere by trying to introduce narrative conflicts into the show. Tucker tells Derrick he'd rather continue the show without Will and demand that Mandy kiss Will, even though she prefers Derrick. The title of the show is explained in the last scene: The cast is hanging out in the sitcom set, with the live audience reacting as if it's an actual show, which Mandy thinks is weird but is told to just pretend that "nobody's watching". Will says that "nobody's watching" is a perfect name for the sitcom they are developing . Derrick protests that "nobody's watching" is a terrible name, because critics will constantly ridicule them with comments like "nobody's watching Nobody's Watching!" He declares that you'd be insane to name a television show that. This is immediately followed by the announcer saying "Next week, on Nobody's Watching!..."
