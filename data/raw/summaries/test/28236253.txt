Mickey and the Scorpions starts his own detective agency. Stinkie Davis kidnaps Mickey's Kid Brudder and hides him in a box headed for a science professor. Mickey and the gang catch up with Mickey's brother, but soon get into a fight with Stinkie and his pals. The kids use some of the Professor's bombs as ammunition; these bombs just so happen to contain chemicals similar to laughing gas, and they literally make the kids high as a kite. Stinkie finally throws a high explosive bomb, which lands in the mouth of Buster, the Scorpions' dog. The bomb is set to go off at a certain time of the day. Wanting to avoid getting blown up, the kids are forced to avoid Buster at all costs.
