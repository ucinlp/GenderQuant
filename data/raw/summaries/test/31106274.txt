For three years he has led a peaceful life and devoted himself to his wife and two children. His past catches up with him when he is ambushed in a parking lot and left for dead with 22 bullets in his body. Against all odds, he survives to take revenge on his killers. Former mafia boss Charlie Mattei is shot by an eight-man death squad in a car park, but survives the hit with severe injuries. On the hunt for the shooters, he finds himself confronted with his criminal past and resulting threat to his family. Mattei had left the business several years ago to his old friend Tony Zacchia. He had since lived a retired life spent with his family. He tries to identify those responsible without bloodshed. This "weakness" is, however, exploited, and his friend Karim is brutally murdered by the same people who had shot him. Mattei swears revenge and goes on a hunt for the masterminds of the attack. He visits the hit squad during a birthday celebration and announces that he will kill them one by one anytime, anywhere. Marie Goldman is the policewoman investigating the shooting in the parking lot. Her husband, who was also a policeman, was killed in the service but his killer was never caught. Despite the indifference of her superiors, she would like to clear up the murder of her husband. Towards the end of the movie, in order to get to Tony Zacchia, a desperate Mattei makes a deal with Goldman, who herself is divided between doing her duty and punishing the murderers of her husband who she suspects were Zacchia's men. The police get a USB stick containing data incriminating Zacchia in a money fraud and laundering operation. He finally confronts Tony Zacchia at his home and is about to kill him, but is interrupted by the police who end up arresting both Zacchia and Mattei. In the end, Mattei is released as the cops do not have enough evidence to charge him. Goldman had earlier in the movie revealed to Mattei that one of the 8 shooters had missed him on purpose in the shootout at the start of the movie. Mattei figures out that this 8th shooter was his friend and lawyer who had been forced by Zacchia into shooting Mattei. He is forgiven by Mattei and the movie ends with Mattei walking with his family on a beach. His voiceover tells the audience that he had left his past life behind him and all he wanted to do was spend whatever possible time he had left with his family. He also says that he will no more have to look over his shoulder as he is at peace with his past. As they walk away, he turns and looks over his shoulder which tells us that there is no getting away from his past for him, ever.
