 The film begins shortly before the outbreak of World War II when ensign Jochen Marseille is located at a Luftwaffe  Kriegsschule  in Berlin, where he makes a negative impression on his superiors with daredevil stunts and undisciplined behavior. His friend and comrade, Robert Franke, helps spare him from severe punishment. His squadron moves to France after the outbreak of World War II. During the Battle of Britain, Marseille experiences the brutality of war for the first time when Franke is shot down over the English Channel and is posted missing for a short while. But after his comrade's return, Marseille is back to a carefree world of flying. A thoughtful conversation in a bar while playing a game of billiards with an elderly French civilian affects him and his fellow pilots only briefly. A short time later, his unit is transferred to the Afrikakorps in the North African Theater of Operations. Marseille, thanks to his outstanding flying skill and talent, quickly becomes the most successful fighter pilot. In North Africa, the intensity of aerial combat continues. During a reconnaissance flight over Egypt, his aircraft suffers an engine failure and only with difficulty does Marseille manage to return to German-controlled airspace. He bails out as the aircraft crashes, but his parachute does not open. His body is later found in the desert. Brigitte receives the news of his death and collapses while teaching a class.
