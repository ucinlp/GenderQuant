In Los Angeles in 2020, the crime rate is up 200%. The police are known as Eliminators, and they fight against the Droid Warriors of Azteca , who dresses in Nazi regalia. The Droid were created as servants, and Taylor has one, Rochester (played by [[Kevin James . Taylor, who was once the best Eliminator but more than anything wants to get back with his ex-wife, Nicola, is blackmailed into attempting to steal a digital decoder to shut down Azteca's forces. Much of Taylor's time, however, is spent at a club watching various sexual couplings featuring adult film stars such as Herschel Savage, Bunny Bleu , Candie Evans, Tom Byron, Keisha, and Kristara Barrington. Third-billed is an assassin called the Blade  who is hired by a man he interrupts masturbating. Eventually, Taylor's apartment is attacked while he is in the shower, and his Droid goes haywire. He gets the decoder and uses it, and is reunited with Nicola. Azteca is not really destroyed however, and "to be continued" looms.
