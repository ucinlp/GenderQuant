Gauri , is found as an injured victim of a bus accident, during her travel to religious places, throughout India. She is taken to a hospital in Mercara, Karnataka, where the doctor declares that she has Amnesia due to the accident, and has forgotten herself and her past, which gives the film its title aptly "Innale" meaning "yesterday". Gauri, forgets her, larger past and starts to move with courage, towards her new found self, after struggling within herself, asking questions. She also meets mallicious people who claim to be her well wishers, taking advantage of her vulnerability. She fights them with the help of the brave Mr. Sharath Menon , who protects her during the transition to become the new Maya. Dr. Sandhya  who treated Gauri, is also Sharath's mother. She too comforts Gauri and allows her to become Maya. Though she does worry about, what is to follow. Sandhya decides to meet anyone who claim to be Gauri's family, so that she could help out Gauri who is now Maya. Sharath brings actors to make Dr. Sandhya believe that Gauri has parents, to get his mother's consent to marry Gauri with whom he has deeply fallen in love with. Sandhya has no other choice than to leave, the young lovers to their own fate.  Meanwhile Dr. Narendran , Gauri's husband, starts to search for his lost wife. After much searching with all his friends and resources he finally gets information about a girl who was an accident victim on a hill station. He calls Sandhya during her birthday party, where the doctor also announces the engagement of Maya with her son, Sharath. Sandhya is shocked and informs her son about Dr. Narendran's phone call. Narendran reminiscences memories of the beautiful days spent with his lovely wife Gauri. The three main characters meet at last in an old house covered in mist, on a haunting valley. The scene talks for itself in silence, where Narendran passes the mist only to find the completely transformed Gauri. He becomes speechless after seeing his wife, who watch and talk to him like a complete stranger. He decides that she has indeed become a new person and it would be unfair to bring her more sorrow by revealing the truth that she is his wife. Tears fill his sad eyes, unable to believe she failed to recognise him. The final dialogue where Sharath happily asks "So she is not the person you were looking for,right? " to which Narendran answers, no by only shaking his head, is a heart wrenching moment. He understands that Sharath and Maya are deeply in love with each other and leaves in haste. The last scene shows the bewildered Maya and Sharath staring at him, leaving so abruptly, without drinking the tea she made. Narendran's sadness is forever, but will Maya regain her past, unanswered questions remain lurking in the mist around. The film warns us about how life can change almost unapologetically. Change can be such a boon to many and a horrible disaster to many others.
