The film is set in 1957â€“1958 in Coburg, in post-World War II West Germany. Schuckert is a local construction entrepreneur whose methods of gaining wealth include shady business practices such as bribing the local officials. His latest scheme is endangered with the arrival of von Bohm, a high minded building commissioner. Von Bohm tries to go for gradual change of the system from within, rather than exposing the participants. Meanwhile he falls in love with a beautiful woman named Lola. They are attracted to each other, and von Bohm starts thinking of marriage. When von Bohm finds her to be a cabaret singer/prostitute in the town brothel where most of von Bohm's adversaries are her clients and she is the 'personal toy' of Schuckert's, he collects evidence against Schuckert to expose the corruption. However, because the town has benefited so much from shady capitalism, no one cares. Von Bohm is seduced into the system by money and marrying Lola. Schuckert gifts the brothel to Lola, now Mrs von Bohm, and von Bohm, on their wedding day. While von Bohm is out walking, Schuckert takes Lola to bed.
