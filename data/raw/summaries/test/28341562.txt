Ik Kudi Punjab Di tells a richly textured tale from a keenly female perspective set against the backdrop of male-dominated Punjabi society. It does so with a Shakespearean credo of “all the world’s a stage” and a lively cast. SP Singh  is a boy from a wealthy family who meets Navdeep , the girl of his dreams, at his college drama class. They quickly bond, much to the chagrin of bad-boy student Vicky  who prizes Navdeep for himself. The male-chauvinist Vicky has no chance with the progressive-minded Navdeep. Even Singh, the man who she admires enough to call a friend, is in for a shock. Navdeep doesn’t want to get married; she’s intent on being the guardian of her loving parents because the family lacks a male heir. Few scene were also filmed in Post Graduate College Sector 11 Chandigarh. Singh tests his own view of women by agreeing to all of Navdeep’s demands, including moving in with her family after marriage. This is seen as both revolutionary  and an affront to Punjabi society and tradition.Manmohan Singh's Ik Kudi Punjab Di: gender equality gets an entertaining treatment
