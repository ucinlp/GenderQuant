Robin Monroe , a New York journalist working for Dazzle, a fashion magazine, is invited by her boyfriend Frank  to spend a week holiday with him on the island paradise of Makatea in the South Pacific. The final leg of their journey to Makatea is in a small dilapidated aircraft  piloted by middle-aged American Quinn Harris . They are accompanied by Quinn's girlfriend and co-pilot Angelica . On their first night on the island, Quinn makes a move on Robin which she rejects as Frank appears. Later that night, Frank proposes to her and she happily accepts resulting in their engagement. The next morning Robin, a workaholic, is called away to Tahiti by her boss, to supervise a fashion event. She hires Quinn to fly her there, but an unexpected thunderstorm forces them to crash-land on a deserted island. Robin is completely distraught that they are the only ones on the island with no communication, no food and no shelter and may be like this for a long time. Initially believing they are on a peninsula rather than an island, they try to find the non existent connection to the mainland. Then believing they are on a different island, they climb a mountain to disable a beacon Quinn believes to be there. But they are unsuccessful as they are on the wrong island. The air-sea rescue team, accompanied by Angelica and Frank, try to find Quinn and Robin, but are unable to do so. Fighting for survival on the island, Quinn and Robin inadvertently become witnesses to modern-day piracy. The pirates discover this and chase Quinn and Robin. Meanwhile, Angelica and Frank are forging their own relationship. One night, thinking that Robin is dead and he will never see her again, Frank gets drunk and sleeps with Angelica. The vast majority of the film deals with the adventures  of Quinn and Robin as they try to escape the island, evade the pirates, survive in the island's jungle wilderness, and repair Quinn's plane so it can take off. In the process, Quinn and Robin fall in love, despite their initial dislike towards one another. After evading the pirates several times, Robin and Quinn are finally discovered. After a narrow escape, Quinn and Robin eventually succeed in getting the plane airworthy again and they fly back to Makatea, just in time for their funerals. Frank is very happy to see Robin alive but is disgusted at himself for sleeping with Angelica and not being able to tell Robin about it. After their arrival, Robin goes to the hospital where Quinn is recovering and tells him about her feelings but he rejects her saying that due to their professional and personal lives, they can't be together. Robin then decides to go back to New York with Frank but at the airport finds she unable to do so. Frank finally tells her about sleeping with Angelica and she tells him about her feelings for Quinn. They decide they aren't in love and she gives him back the engagement ring. Meanwhile, Quinn has had a change of heart and rushes to the airport, but is too late to stop the plane. He then encounters Robin getting out of an airplane, having stopped the flight telling the crew that she just couldn't go. He walks up to her and finally reciprocates her feelings for him. The movie ends with Quinn and Robin embracing and kissing each other.
