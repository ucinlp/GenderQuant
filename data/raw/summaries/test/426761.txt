The film's events take place almost exclusively on August 18, 1981 at Camp Firewood, a summer camp located near Waterville, Maine. It is the last day of summer camp, which means counselors have one last chance to have a romantic encounter with another person at Camp Firewood. The summer ultimately culminates with a talent show. Beth , the camp director, struggles to keep her counselors in order &mdash; and her campers alive &mdash; while falling in love with Henry , an astrophysics associate professor at the local college. Henry has to devise a plan to save the camp from a piece of NASA's Skylab, which is falling to Earth. Coop  has a crush on Katie , his fellow counselor, but has to pry her away from her rebellious, obnoxious, and obviously unfaithful boyfriend, Andy . Only Gene , the shell-shocked Vietnam war veteran and camp chef, can help Coop win Katie &mdash; with some help from a talking can of vegetables . All the while, Gary , Gene's unfortunately chosen apprentice, and J.J.  attempt to figure out why McKinley  hasn't been with a woman; and Susie  and Ben  attempt to produce and choreograph the greatest talent show Camp Firewood has ever seen.
