The plot is the same as the original Wiggle Time except for two new songs  and the exclusion of "Fruit Salad" . Also, unlike the original, Wags the Dog appears in the remake. As mentioned above, there is also concert footage at the end, featuring three songs: "Wave to Wags", "Five Little Ducks", and "Wiggly Medley".
