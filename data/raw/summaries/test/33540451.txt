While at home alone, Amber  is attacked and murdered. However, the murder is passed off as a suicide by Officer Bates . A group of troubled teens, including Archie , Kenny , Ashleigh , Ricky , Jasmine , Samantha , James  and Cain  have been contemplating suicide for a long time, and after hearing of Amber's death, decide to make a suicide pact and kill themselves at Ashleigh's upcoming party. However, later that night, as Samantha is making a suicide diary she is stabbed to death by a masked killer. Meanwhile, after Ashleigh leaves her house, Kenny breaks in with his friend Davey  to set up cameras around her house, so the group's suicide can be recorded and Davey can exclusively release the footage. Meanwhile, Archie and Jasmine start a romance, which leads to Archie suggesting he and Jasmine remove themselves from the suicide pact, but this repels Jasmine. Soon after, Bates and his partner Mason  discover Samantha's death scene. The following day, the group is shocked by the death of Samantha. At college, Jasmine is attacked by the killer, but manages to phone the police and lock herself in a room. Archie finds Jasmine, and she is taken to the hospital while he is questioned by Bates and Mason who seem to think Jasmine is suffering from a condition which made her imagine the attack. At night, Ashleigh, Ricky, James and Cain meet up and contemplate who could have attacked Jasmine, and soon have doubts about whether they want to continue with the suicide pact. Meanwhile, Kenny, who is now being filmed by Davey for a suicide diary, decides he will shoot everyone at Ashleigh's party so his death will be more famous. The following day, while walking down the road, James encounters a bully, Curtis , but the rest of the group defends him. The group then meets with Kenny and tells him they are not going to do the suicide pact, angering Kenny. Mr. Hudson , a teacher at the college, makes a phone call to an unknown receiver, telling them he is out of the deal. Upon returning home, Mr. Hudson finds his wife dead, before he too is murdered. As the group try to figure out who the murderer is, suspicion falls on nearly everyone. At night, while making his way to Ashleigh's party, Ricky, believing he hears Amber's voice, has his throat slashed by the killer. At the party, Bates and Mason patrol the grounds. Inside, everyone is having fun. Curtis and his date go to the bathroom, where both are stabbed to death. Outside, Kenny and Davey arrive, but Bates and Mason apprehend Kenny before he can enter the house with the gun. After a while, the party begins to wind down. James is stabbed to death, before Ashleigh is chased outside by the killer and hides in the garden after she fails to get the attention of the party-goers. The killer cuts the electricity off, sending the rest of the party-goers home. As Ashleigh tries once more to gain their attention, she is stabbed to death. Archie and Jasmine, who have been spending time alone together, return to the party to find the house empty. Inside, they are stalked in the darkness and discover Cain's and Davey's bodies, and are eventually split up. Moments later Jasmine emerges from the house distraught, as Bates arrives. Bates enters the house and finds Archie dead. Outside, Jasmine reaches the police car and finds both Mason and Kenny murdered, before Bates attacks her, revealing himself to be the killer. As he is about to kill Jasmine, Archie reveals himself to be alive and together, Archie and Jasmine overpower Bates and shoot him. As Jasmine tends to Archie, Bates narrates the line "Demons Never Die" before opening his eyes.
