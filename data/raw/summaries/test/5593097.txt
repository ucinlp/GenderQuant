In 1984, 33 years after the events depicted in The Last Picture Show, 50-year-old Duane Jackson  is a wealthy tycoon of a near bankrupt oil company. His relationship with his family isn't prospering either. His wife, Karla , believes that Duane is cheating on her and his son, Dickie , seems to be following in his father's libidinous footsteps. Ruth Popper  works as Duane's secretary; and despondent Lester Marlow , now a businessman, seems a prime candidate for a business crisis or a heart attack or both. Sonny Crawford's  increasingly erratic behavior causes Duane concern over Sonny's mental health. Jacy Farrow  has traveled the world and experienced its pleasures. A painful tragedy brings her back to her hometown and once again into Duane's life.
