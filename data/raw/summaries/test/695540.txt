The cartune ostensibly stars Andy Panda  and his father, Papa Panda , but it is Woody  who steals the show. The woodpecker constantly pesters the two pandas, apparently just for the fun of it. Andy, meanwhile, tries to sprinkle salt on Woody's tail in the belief that this will somehow capture the bird. To Woody's surprise, Andy's attempts prevail , and in an ending very similar to 1938's Daffy Duck & Egghead, Woody is taken away to the funny farm&mdash;where his captors prove to be crazier than he is.
