British intelligence asks American soldier of fortune Charles Hood to go to Portugal and help stop an international criminal mastermind called Hammerhead who plans to steal a secret report on nuclear defense. Hood manages to board the yacht owned by Hammerhead, a collector of valuable erotic art. He is distracted along the way by model Sue Trenton plus a pair of Hammerhead's mistresses, Ivory and Kit. Hammerhead intends to kidnap Britain's NATO delegate, Sir Richard Calvert, and replace him with a lookalike, Andreas, a master of disguise. He finds out Hood's identity and traps him and Sue inside a coffin, but they manage to escape. Kit and Andreas both are killed, while Ivory does away with Hammerhead personally, using a harpoon.
