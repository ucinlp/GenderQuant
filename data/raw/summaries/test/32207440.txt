Katie  and Sara  have been best friends since childhood. They enter college together, where Katie is a prized legacy candidate for the Delta Beta Theta sorority, which was co-founded decades ago by her mother, Lutie  and Summer , whose own daughter Gwen  now leads the Deltas on campus. An event occurs during pledge week that causes a rift between Katie and the Deltas, which leaves Sara as a Delta pledge and Katie out in the cold. Katie joins the rival Kappa Theta Xi sorority, and the rivalry splits not just Katie and Sara, but extends all the way into the Delta alumnae association led by Lutie and Summer.
