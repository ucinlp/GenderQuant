Doctor Dr√© and Ed Lover are two bumbling barbers at a Harlem barbershop. Knowing full well that cutting hair is not their calling, their boss, friend, and mentor Nick ([[Jim Moody  tells the two maybe they should try out for the police academy. Crazily enough, it works out for the two, and they are accepted on the New York police force. Things seem to be going well for them, when tragedy suddenly strikes, and they lose a close friend. Now enforcers of the law, the tag team decides to investigate the incident, which they believe to be a murder. Ed and Dre find out through the streets that a crooked land developer named Demetrius ([[Richard Bright  might have had something to do with their friend's death, and proceed to attempt to dig up as much dirt on him as possible. This proves to be difficult, however, when they've got a nutty Sergeant , a moody detective , and a bunch of unwilling street hoods ([[Guru  to go through to get the information they need. Though there aren't any certain clues to be found, strange happenings are certainly going on, as Demetrius' company seems to be digging for something rather than looking to build on all the property he's buying up in their Harlem neighborhood, and the bodies slowly continue to pile up around them.
