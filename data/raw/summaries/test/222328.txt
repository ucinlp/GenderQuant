The movie starts with an introduction by Vishwanath, "'Sisurvetti pasurvetti, vetti gana rasam phanihi'  We hope you appreciate our effort in bringing you the Jeeva Dhara of Indian classical music." "Shankarabharanam" Shankara Sastri is a very popular Carnatic singer. He is immersed in sangeeta rasaamruta  with his nirantara saadhana . People come in huge numbers to listen his voice and consider him a great man. He has mastered the raga Shankarabharanam, and hence is eponymous with the same. Tulasi,  is a prostitute's daughter who has great interest in music and dance. She is also an admirer of Sastri and learns music from him when he used to teach his own daughter along the riverside. But her mother wants her to become a prostitute to earn money. One day a rich client of her mother's rapes Tulasi. He insults Sastri saying that now that he was done with Tulasi, she could go and flirt with Sastri all she wanted. Enraged by the disgrace towards Sastri, her guru, she kills the client. Her mother was sent to jail because of Sastriji's friend, a lawyer  and was saved from jail but has found out that she is pregnant. Sastri tries to save her by consulting a lawyer who wins the case in Tulasi's favour. Then Sastri brings her to his home where other people insult him as Tulasi is a murderer and daughter of a prostitute while Sastri is a devout Brahmin. Tulasi moves out of his house as she does not want him to face insults because of her but hopes to show her gratitude towards him. Ten years pass by, pop music is now popular in India and Sastri loses his classical music lovers. He now lives in a small house with his grown up daughter. When Tulasi comes to know of Sastri's plight she tries to help him monetarily but gives the money through someone else. Tulasi inherits all of her mother's property and utilizes all of it to help him. She also asks her son to go to Sastri's home and learn classical music from him. After managing to get an entry to Sastri's home, he starts learning Carnatic music from the maestro. Chandra Mohan, a dilettante falls in love with Sastri's daughter. Although Sastri rejects the marriage proposal at first, he later agrees after knowing the man's interest in classical music. Tulasi, then arranges for a concert on the very day of his daughter's wedding, where Sastri once again finds his lost audience come back to see hear his voice. Sastri sings at the concert and halfway through it suffers a heart attack and finds his new disciple, Tulasi's son, take over the concert from him. As he watches him with pride, he also sees Tulasi and finds out that the boy is indeed, Tulasi's son. After the performance, he symbolically anoints the boy as heir to his music and dies. Tulasi comes to her guru and falls down at his feet and also passes away, that very moment, along with him. The film ends with both Sastri and Tulasi dead on the stage.
