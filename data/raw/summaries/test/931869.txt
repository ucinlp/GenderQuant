Christine Painter  is a sexually naive waitress and single-mother who pays for her teenage son's tuition by renting flats to local tarts. She later becomes a call girl herself - joining her friend Shirley  and their "maid" Dolly  - and specializes in fetish/kink roleplay with older gentlemen. With her new family of friends and admirers, she becomes a huge sensation leading to wealth and infamy in the tabloids. The brothel business also brings out Christine's self-confidence, and leads to repairing a previously strained relationship with her father.
