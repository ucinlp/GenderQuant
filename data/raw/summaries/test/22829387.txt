Myung-su and Hyung-su are identical twins with opposing personalities. Hyung-su graduated top of his class in high school and is on his way to Seoul University to study law, supported by his mother who runs a hole-in-the-wall restaurant near a train station. By contrast, Myung-su works as a bouncer at a local brothel and helps out in his mother's restaurant, but is happy to trade places with his brother whenever there is trouble. The two brothers have their lives turned upside down when Hyung-su is accused of a crime.
