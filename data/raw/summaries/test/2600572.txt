The three men -- Jack, Michael, and Peter -- are living with Mary, who is now five, and her mother Sylvia. The group is split up when Sylvia announces that she is getting married to an Englishman and that she and her future husband intend to move to England after the wedding, taking Mary with them. Peter and Michael  travel to the wedding, where Peter realizes that Sylvia's fianc√©, Edward, intends to pack Mary off to a boarding school  as he has no real interest in her. Edward denies everything and Sylvia refuses to believe Peter, knowing he has disliked Edward from the beginning. An attraction between Peter and Sylvia is nevertheless growing, something he refuses to acknowledge. Peter breaks into Pileforth in an attempt to get proof of Edward's scheme to send Mary there. He is discovered by the headmistress, Miss Elspeth Lomax, who says she has been told by Edward that Peter is in love with her. She begins to take her clothes off and tries to have sex with him, but Peter manages to get away and later explains to her that Edward made up the fact that he had feelings for her, but apologizes for the misunderstanding. Peter, with help from Miss Lomax, heads off to stop the wedding. To cause a delay, Michael has kidnapped the vicar and Jack disguises himself as an elderly replacement vicar. Peter and Miss Lomax arrive at the church after numerous delays. He confronts Sylvia with the truth, Miss Lomax herself confirming that Edward has been lying. Sylvia confronts the groom and Edward admits the truth but it is too late -- they are already married. Or so it would seem.... until Jack reveals himself to everyone. Not only has Jack finally proved his acting skills, but the marriage is null and void. Sylvia declares her intention to go home, but Peter stops her and declares his love. The two marry with Mary as their bridesmaid.
