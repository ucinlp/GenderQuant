Tibby, the wife of Samuel Sweetland  dies, and shortly afterwards his daughter marries and leaves home, leaving him on his own with his two servants. His wife had told him that he should remarry after her death, so he pursues some local spinsters who were at his daughter's wedding after he and his housekeeper Minta  make out a list of possibles. First is widow Louisa Windeatt, but she is too independent. Next comes Thirza Tapper, a confirmed spinster and nervous wreck who almost collapses when he proposes to her. She too rejects him. He wanders outside as other guests arrive for her party. His servant Ash is helping at the party and Ash steals the scene here as a bolshy butler wearing an ill fitting coat and trying to keep his trousers up while doing his buttling work at the party. While the others are outside listening to some glee singers, Samuel proposes to Mary Hearn, but she rejects him as too old, but then goes into hysterics when he angrily tells her some home truths about being mutton dressed as lamb. Later he leaves Minta to try number four, Mercy Bassett, a barmaid at a local inn. After he leaves we get to see that Minta is in love with him. Bassett rejects him too and he comes home dejectedly. Meanwhile postmistress Hearn and Tapper compare notes and Hearn decides she should marry him after all and she goes to his house with Tapper. Having run through the women who have turned him down, Samuel sees Minta for the first time as more than a housekeeper and decides that she is the woman for him, if she'll have him. He tells her he has got used to being rejected and will not be angry if she rejects him too. She accepts him and he tells her to put on the dress Tibby gave her. As she goes to the room, Hearn and Tapper arrive. Hearn says she is now willing to be his wife. Samuel says all should drink a toast to his wife to be and Hearn is sure it is her till Minta comes down the stairs in an attractive dress. Hearn lapses into hysterics as the couple get together.
