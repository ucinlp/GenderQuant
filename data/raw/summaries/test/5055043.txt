The premise of the framing animation was a general parody of the popular 1970s/1980s television series Fantasy Island, with Daffy and Speedy playing caricatures of that series' principal characters, Mr. Roarke and Tattoo . The pair, stranded on a desert island for months with nothing on it but a coconut tree , discover a treasure map which leads them to a magical, talking wishing well . The greedy Daffy proposes to use the power of the well, which obeys the commands of whoever holds the map, to make himself and Speedy rich by selling wishes for a hefty fee, and has the well transform the island into a tourist paradise. . As various Warner Bros. animated characters step up for their chance at the well, their wishes are fulfilled through the events of a classic Warner cartoon. Meanwhile, Yosemite Sam, cast as a pirate, and his first mate, the Tasmanian Devil, search for the map, which originally belonged to them . They find out that someone who took the Map has black feathers. Eventually, the map is lost to all after being burnt when the chase lead up to a volcano, and Daffy, Speedy, Sam, and Taz end up trapped on the once-again-deserted island. The well gives them three wishes individually, but warns them to use them wisely for it assures them they are the last wishes it will grant. After Daffy and Speedy waste their wishes -Speedy wishing for a burrito, then Daffy angrily responding by wishing the burrito was stuck on the end of Speedy's nose, an obvious reference to The Ridiculous Wishes-, Daffy asks Sam to wish the burrito off Speedy's nose , the pair discover that Sam wishes for a ship, abandoning Daffy, and telling them after he sinks Bugs, he'll come back and pick them up. Daffy , then shouts out his famous catchphrase, "You're Desthspicable!" at Sam and Taz, the wishing well does the sign-off.
