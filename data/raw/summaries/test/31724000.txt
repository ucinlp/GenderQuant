"Seven Oaks is an East Coast college with beautiful Greek Revival architecture and a boorish male student population. Decades after coeducation's arrival the male atmosphere still prevails. A dynamic trio of girls -- group leader Violet Wister , principled Rose  and sexy Heather  -- decide to change all that, setting out to rescue their fellow students from depression, grunge and low standards of every kind. At New Student Orientation the trio spots lost-looking Lily  and takes her under wing. Meanwhile the girls become romantically entangled with a series of men -- including slick Charlie , dreamboat Xavier  and the mad frat pack of Frank ([[Ryan Metcalf  and Thor  -- who threaten their friendship and sanity."
