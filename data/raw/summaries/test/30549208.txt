The wealthy McNeil wants to control Prairie City and the land around it. He tries to burn out small ranchers and then hires gunfighter Johnny Crale to run them off. Sven Hansen learns from neighbor Jose Mirada that there is oil on his land. Sven stands up to Crale, his only weapon a harpoon from his past as a whaling fisherman, and Crale shoots him dead. The dead man's son, George Hansen, arrives in town and finds out that his father has died, but isn't sure how. The sheriff is in McNeil's pocket and unwilling to help. George tries talking to Molly, the wife of Crale, but ends up beaten unconscious and dumped on a train leaving town. Mirada is the next one gunned down by Crale, but his courage impresses the killer, who in a fit of rage shoots McNeil, the man who hired him. George Hansen returns to town for a showdown and is wounded before getting the better of Crale with his father's harpoon.
