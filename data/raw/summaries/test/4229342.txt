The film takes place just after the fictional disappearance of Richard Dutcher, famous for beginning the current Mormon movie phase with his work God's Army. After Dutcher's disappearance the film follows the journeys of three Mormon filmmakers who are eager to take his place. However, one of these filmmakers doesn't really want to see Dutcher found.
