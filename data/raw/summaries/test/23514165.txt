In 1991, an 11-year-old girl named Alyssa "Ally" Craig witnesses the murder of her mother on a New York City Subway platform, on the F Line at 18th Avenue and McDonald Avenue elevated station in Brooklyn. Ten years later, a 21-year-old Ally  is a student at New York University. She lives at home with her overprotective detective father, Neil ([[Chris Cooper . Tyler Hawkins , a moody, directionless 21-year-old, is auditing classes at NYU and working in a bookstore. He has had a strained relationship with his businessman father, Charles  since his brother Michael's suicide . Charles appears to ignore his youngest child, Caroline , with whom Tyler is very close. One night, Tyler and his roommate Aidan  find themselves in trouble with Neil. Later, Aidan sees Neil dropping Ally off at NYU. He decides to retaliate against the detective by persuading Tyler to sleep with and ultimately dump Ally. Tyler reluctantly agrees to meet her. After spending some time together, Ally and Tyler bond over the losses in their lives and begin to fall in love. After Ally sleeps over at Tyler's house, she and her father have a fight, ending with Neil hitting her. Ally then moves in with Tyler and Aidan. Meanwhile, Caroline, who is a budding artist, is featured in an art show. Tyler tries to convince his father to attend the show, but he is forced away on business. Tyler angrily confronts him after the show, which drives a further wedge between the two. Later, Neil's friend, a cop, recognizes Tyler with Ally on a train coming from a beach holiday with his family. Neil breaks into Tyler's apartment and confronts Tyler. Tyler provokes Neil by confessing to Aidan's plan and his initial reason for meeting Ally, which in turn forces Tyler to confess everything to Ally. She leaves him angrily and returns to her father's home. The couple remain alienated until Aidan visits her to explain that only he is to blame, and that Tyler was sincerely in love with her. They are then shown to be back together, as they walk with Caroline in the park. Before this reunion, Caroline is bullied by a group of classmates at a birthday party; they cut her hair off, and when they tease her in front of Tyler, he turns violent and ends up in jail again. Charles is impressed that Tyler stood up for his sister, and they begin to reconnect. Later, Charles asks Tyler to meet with him and his lawyers at his office. Charles takes Caroline to school and is late, so Tyler waits in his office, where he sees, on Charles's computer, a screensaver of pictures of Tyler, Michael, and Caroline when they were younger. Caroline is then shown in class and the teacher draws her attention to the board, where the date is revealed as September 11, 2001. Tyler looks out at Manhattan from the window of his father's office&mdash;which is located in the North Tower of the World Trade Center. He's standing at the exact point that Flight 11 hit the tower. Once the 9/11 terrorist attacks begin, the rest of the family  are seen looking horrified at the towers before the camera pans over the rubble, showing Tyler's diary. Tyler is later buried next to Michael. Some time later, Caroline  and Charles seem to have a healthy father-daughter relationship. Aidan, who has since gotten a tattoo of Tyler's name on his arm, is working hard in school and Ally is finally taking the subway again, after having avoided it since her mother's death. The film ends as she looks at the camera with a small, sad smile.
