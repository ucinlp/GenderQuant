Captain Jeff Eliot returns to Germany in 1947 to visit the family who rescued him and hid him from the Nazis after his plane was shot down over Munich in World War II. He learns that most of the family was killed by a U.S. Air Force air raid. The only survivor is the daughter, Wilhelmina Lehrt, who is working as a bar maid in a nightclub and hates Americans. Eliot nonetheless manages to romance Wilhelmina, and in his time at the nightclub, he develops a friendship with Heisemann, a comic. Heisemann, it turns out, has secret ties to an underground Nazi revivalist movement. When Eliot discovers this, he tells his superiors, who order him to continue his relationship with Wilhemina and try to learn more about Heisemann's operation. The chase scene at the end of the picture, ends in Berchtesgaden, and the scenes of Heisemann being chased, were filmed right inside the ruins of Hitler's house. Heisemann in the end is standing on the frame of the huge picture window of the house.
