Tom is a mascot aboard a cruise ship and is warned by the captain that Tom will be replaced if a mouse is found on board the ship. Jerry tries to board the ship but is kicked out by Tom, Jerry continues to board the ship unsuccessfully until boarding on the anchor of the ship. He then ties Tom's tail to a lifesaver ring and makes a fake call for help. Tom throws the ring and this results himself being thrown off the ship. Tom manages to get back on the ship anyhow, soaking wet and furious. Jerry slips up Tom as he passes by with a bar of soap and Tom salutes a passing captain as he is thrown off the ship. Tom emerges soaking wet once again onto the stern. Tom dives into the pool after seeing Jerry dive into it, but Jerry drains all the water out, causing Tom to crash into the floor. Then, Tom is seen standing in front of the ship's horn, and is blasted by a jet of boiling water when Jerry switches it on.  Jerry, successfully ridding Tom off the ship again, walks along the edge of the deck playing his ukulele, but Tom, now really furious, pokes his head up and Jerry flees into a theater where Texas Tom is being shown. When Jerry laughs at Tom, Tom is annoyed and throws Jerry off the ship and into the air, after reaching his highest point, Jerry realises he's going to fall. Jerry lands on the mast, falls into a vent, and drops into a food serving tray. The captain praises Tom on keeping mice off the ship until the food is served and much to Tom's horror, it turns out to be the tray that Jerry fell into. Tom is thrown into the brig and watches as Jerry surfs to the coast of Hawaii.
