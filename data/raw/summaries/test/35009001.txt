The film tells the story of an elderly woman Anzirat  who lives in a small village in Soviet Uzbeksitan with her son, daughter-in-law, and their ten children, all boys. Because of her strictness the villagers call Anzirat "Grandma-General." Back in the 1930s, she headed the main farm of the village and went through many hardships. Even when she gets old, Anzirat does not want to rest and cannot put up with the laziness, greed, and negligence of some villagers. She tries to put things in order for the family. Her son, however, instead of helping his pregnant wife, spends all his spare time building a family football team. Only after Anzirat's death do the inhabitants of the village realize how empty their village is without her. They feel that Anzirat was the "conscience" of their village.
