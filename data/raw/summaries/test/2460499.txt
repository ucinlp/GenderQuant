An American pulp novelist, Mark Kendrick , meets his rich neighbors across the lake and is soon seduced by beautiful blonde Carol , the wife of the older Forrest . Forrest is badly injured when his boat has an accident in the fog, and Carol throws him overboard. After first refusing to go along with her attempt to call it an accident, Kendrick agrees when they plan to meet in a month's time and live off her dead husband's money. But when the coroner calls the death an accident, she secretly marries another old flame three weeks later and changes residences. When Kendrick finds out about the betrayal he angrily confronts her and she sneers at him that she only used him and that there's nothing he could do about it. Mark confesses, knowing that doing so would only mean a prison sentence for him.
