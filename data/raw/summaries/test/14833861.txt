After emerging from a blacked-out skyscraper from which a famous humanitarian apparently jumped to his death, cost accountant David Stillwell  is stunned to discover that gunmen are chasing him and he has no idea why. Stillwell gradually realizes that he suffers from "unconscious amnesia", and that this illness has caused him to apparently black out the events of the past two years. The problem is that a prickly psychiatrist he consults assures him that it is impossible for unconscious amnesia to last more than a day or two. As he furiously tries to piece together the puzzle of his life, Stillwell comes across Shela , who implies that they have been involved in a relationship. She is vague and evasive, insisting that not remembering is the only thing keeping him alive. He apparently has something a mysterious figure known only as "The Major" wants, but he doesn't know what it is. He recalls working as a "cost accountant" for Unidyne, the company Charles Calvin , a wealthy  humanitarian whose "nightmare ended just as [Stillwell's] began". Nothing adds up. Stillwell's life is threatened by mysterious men . He engages the private detective Ted Caselle , who is more willing than able, this being his first case. The case? Find out who David Stillwell is and why strangers are trying to kill him. When Stillwell seeks out Calvin's widow to ask what killed him, she replies: "You did." As his fog lifts, Stillwell comes to realize that he is not at all what he thought himself to be, "Cost Accountant" is a metaphor he used for his real work as a physical chemist. The Garrison Foundation he works for is actually a secret branch of Unidyne, and Stillwell's work is a method to neutralize radiation will allows radiation-free atomic bombs to be made. His amnesia was induced when he tried to burn the only existing copy of his work, with Calvin falling to his death during an attempt to grab it. This Hitchcockian screenplay is written by Peter Stone as a follow-up to the hugely successful Charade. Matthau and Kennedy are holdovers from Charade.
