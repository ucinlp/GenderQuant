The film opens with a suicide attempt by ACP Agnel Wilson  on the pretext of the Bombay Blasts in 1993. When questioned, he breaks down claiming the recent events as his fault, citing that 18 years ago when he was posted as the ACP in the Mumbai crime branch, his inability to take the required action led to the rise of Shoaib Khan ,who played a key role in these blasts. He then goes on to narrate the time in Bombay during the 1970s, when it was ruled by smuggler Sultan Mirza , his downfall and the consequent rise of Shoaib to power. After being hit by a flood in his hometown in Madras, Mirza arrives in Mumbai, where he starts working as a coal shoveler who smuggles gold items. Despite having a meager earning, he never fails to help the poor and needy and earns their support and respect. Gradually, he becomes the kingpin of smuggling world in Mumbai. He successfully divides the area among four gangsters peacefully, thus pinning the police in the deck and becoming the leader of Mumbai's underworld activities. Despite being a criminal, Mirza is shown to be a godfather-like figure to the people and a man of principles. He is against smuggling contraband as it is against his Muslim faith. Mirza has a crush on Bollywood actress Rehana  and eventually the two begin to date each other, and Sultan invests black money in her upcoming films. ACP Wilson moves to stop Rihana's films funded by Sultan. But he is tricked by Sultan and Rihana and gets framed for accepting bribe, damaging his credibility. Meanwhile Shoaib is a very ambitious person with a very dark and daring character right from his childhood. His father hussain khan, a sub-inspector in Bombay Police, tries very hard to control him unsuccessfully. He grows up to become a notorious gangster, being frequently involved in petty robberies. Worried, Shoaib's father turns to Sultan for help to which he agrees and helps him set up an electronics shop. But Shoaib is unsatisfied, as his only ambition now is to become rich and powerful like Mirza. Shoaib's girlfriend Mumtaz  works in a local jewellery shop, which Shoaib visits often and gives her stolen jewelry. One day when a customer recognizes her necklace on Mumtaz, she decides to confront him. This enrages Shoaib who beats up the owner of the necklace and destroys his shop. He goes to Sultan to be a part of his crime ring. Seeing his potential, Sultan agrees to take him under his wing. Shoaib learns the tricks of the trade and soon becomes Sultan's trusted aide. ACP Wilson considers Shoaib's ideas and dark ambitions for quick money and power in a potential conflict to Sultan's ideals and hence foresees Shoaib causing the eventual downfall of Sultan. He even refrains from killing Sultan and Shoaib at one point. Finally when Shoaib becomes invincible, he blames himself for the catastrophe. Meanwhile, Sultan decides to enter politics and goes to Delhi to meet the Home Minister of India, handing over his power to Shoaib. The money, unlimited power and Shoiab's unscrupulous ambitions lead him to carry out trades and acts which Sultan himself strongly condemns. He starts manufacturing illicit liquor, accepts contract killings, starts investing in drug peddling and runs extortion rackets. When Sultan returns to Bombay, he comes to know about Shoaib's misdeeds. He finds Shoaib in a party and slaps him publicly for his unethical activities. This infuriates Shoaib and he plots revenge. One day, as Sultan campaigns for his new party, Shoaib appears and assassinates Sultan Mirza whilst addressing the people on the dais, thus ending the saga of a smuggler who was loved by his people. Agnel, who was narrating the story, admits later that Shoaib has established an empire and operates from other countries as the kingpin of Mumbai. No government or force can reach or harm him.
