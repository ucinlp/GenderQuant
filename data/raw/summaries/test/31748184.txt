This knockabout English comedy is a spoof on the Hammer series of vampire films. In her crumbling castle clinging to a rocky, isolated Cornish island, Morticia de'Ath, a vampire noblewoman  and her zombie henchman, Grunt , are concocting a sinister plan. Aided by misguided alchemist, Doctor N. Sane , they aim to discover the magical cure for vampires to become immune to the deadly rays of sunlight! Caught up in her evil plans are two bickering office workers Kevin Smallcock and Susan Swallows, and an enigmatic old world vampire hunter Professor Van Rental. Along the way they encounter werewolves, demons, a seductive trio of vampire girls in nighgowns and culminating in a woodland battle with 100 Medieval vampire soldiers and their commanding officer a fey green skined battle demon.
