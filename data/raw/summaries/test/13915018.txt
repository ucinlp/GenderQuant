Ponthan Mada is based on two short stories, Ponthan Mada and Sheema Thampuran by C. V. Sreeraman. Set in the 1940s British India, the film is about the extra ordinary, touching and heartening bonding of the so-called low-caste Ponthan Mada  with his colonial landlord Sheema Thampuran , who was expelled to British India from England during his youth for supporting the Irish Republican Army. Crossing the class boundaries, the two communicate through Thampuran's window with Mada hanging from a palm tree.
