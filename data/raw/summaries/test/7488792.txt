Max Fleischer draws Betty, then leaves her for the night in the studio. Koko escapes from the inkwell and helps himself to a candy bar left behind by Max. He soon gets a terrible toothache. Betty tries to perform some amateur dentistry on Koko, but uses too much laughing gas. The laughing gas spreads the room, making a cuckoo clock and a typewriter laugh hysterically. The laughing gas then goes out the window and spreads into town. Both people and inanimate objects begin laughing hysterically, including  The short ends when Betty and Koko get back in the inkwell, and it begins laughing, but although it gets tired from laughing.
