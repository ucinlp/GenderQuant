Set in the early 1970s, Jimmy McMahon  is an Irishman living in Liverpool who directs a c√©ilidh band of young men who go to a competition of traditional Celtic music in Ireland in County Clare. A native Irish band directed by John Joe McMahon  is also present to compete as well, with animosity between Jimmy and John as they are brothers. The two brothers could not be more different, as they have taken different paths. There are multiple surprises for them as the competition takes place, with a familial twist at the very end.
