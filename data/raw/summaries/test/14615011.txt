After the broker friend disappears, though, Ewing believes that he has squandered their money, and sets out on a course of action to recover it. He takes out a life insurance policy and then tries to get himself "accidentally" killed. His numerous attempts are to no avail. Next he hires some strong arms to kill him since they have apparently been following him anyway. He gives the money for his murder for hire to his valet, Oki . But then the broker returns and Ewing discovers that his investment has doubled! With the strong arms after him, Ewing must straighten out the situation before it's too late.
