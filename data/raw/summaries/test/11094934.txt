{{Expand section}} The evil Dr. Krupp , also known as "The Bat", plots to steal a valuable Aztec treasure from the tomb of a centuries-old living mummy, Popoca . Krupp builds a robot to defeat the mummy. Krupp's former colleague Dr. Eduardo Almada  and associates work to stop the mad scientist from creating his robot. The movie shows a notable lack of awareness of Mesoamerican civilizations, as it suggests the Aztecs practiced mummification and used hieroglyphics. In reality, they had no system of writing and practiced cremation and  simple burial. It was the Inca civilization that practiced mummification, and the Maya who had a system of hieroglyphics. Also, the mummy is depicted in the Egyptian style  rather than in the Inca style .
