Prince Yeonsan-gun lusts after Yahwa, whose husband Yun Pil-u was executed after being branded a traitor. Yahwa chooses to take her own life in order to be reunited with Pil-u, but before she dies she asks her cat to take revenge for them. Afterwards, the bodies of court ladies and patrol guards are found dead in the palace every morning, and the ghosts of Yahwa and Pil-u are seen accompanied by the mewing of a cat. Kim Chung-won, Pil-u's friend and head of the guardsmen, uses the power of a Buddhist priest to get rid of the ghosts and restore peace to the nation.
