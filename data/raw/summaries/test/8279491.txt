Astronomer Cyrus Layton is working late one night on his new airplane design in his observatory. He witnesses what he believes is a meteorite landing in the far distance. He contacts his niece Sheila and asks her to bring Craig Foster to the observatory to help analyze his discovery. he sets out to search for the meteorite crater but instead discovers a spaceship. The ship's pilot emerges and explains that he is from the planet Mars. Mistakenly thinking the alien is friendly, Layton takes him back to the observatory. Once there the martian, calling himself "The Purple Monster", wishes to see Layton's designs for the new airplane/spaceship. He proudly shows the alien the designs until the alien explains that he is stealing the designs, building a spaceship for himself, flying back to Mars and having a fleet built to invade the Earth. When Dr. Layton objects, the martian kills him with a weapon that emits a "carbo-oxide" gas which kills instantly. The alien then transforms into a ghost and takes over Dr Layton's body. This enables him to fool the astronomer's niece Sheila and criminologist Craig Foster, both of whom work with Dr Layton's foundation, which is responsible for commissioning the spaceship project. inhabiting Dr. Layton allows the Martian to witness the unrelated theft of the plans by a gangster named Garrett. The Martian convinces Garrett and his gang to aid in the invasion plot. With the criminals' help the alien begins building the spaceship. However, eventually the Martian's efforts at pretending to be Dr Layton fall apart and Foster and Sheila realize what is happening. A series of action scenes show the he pair trying to figure out and stop whatever the alien is doing on Earth. Craig and Sheila constantly battle the Purple Monster's Garrett and his henchmen, who use mind-control poisons, carjackings, and even a booby-trapped vacant to dispose of Craig and Sheila. The closest the criminals come to succeeding is in Chapter 7 , when Sheila is lured into a trap at the gang's hideout. Foster gets the information out of a captured gang member and speeds to the house to save Sheila, who has been tied up and gagged inside a room filled with explosives set to detonate after an electric eye is tripped. At the end of Chapter 7, Foster steps into the electric eye, triggering the explosives and detonating the building. However, at the beginning of Chapter 8, Shelia manages to remove her gag and alert Foster about the eye, allowing him to jump over it. Once safely out of the building, Foster shoots a henchman, causing him to fall into the electric eye and trigger the bomb. In the last chapter Craig and Sheila realize that the Purple Monster is using Professor Layton's body and they devise a plan to uncover the truth. While Sheila gets the supposed Doctor Layton to come downtown to sign some papers needed for funding, Craig slips into Layton's office and secretly installs a movie camera which will be remotely activated when the telephone is used. Foster then escapes and calls the office to advise him that he will be bringing reinforcements to search the observatory, which he has discovered is the Purple Monster's hideout. Craig and Sheila arrive to find the observatory deserted. Sheila goes to the basement where she stumbles upon Purple Monster's subterranean lair and is kidnapped. Foster goes to check on Sheila and finds the basement empty. He then discovers the secret lair where Sheila has been bound and gagged. The Purple Monster orders his henchmen to dispose of her and destroy the observatory once he escapes. The story ends with Craig Foster using a part of the spaceship, a sonic pulse cannon used to shatter meteors. He destroys the alien spaceship with the Purple Monster inside as he attempts to fly back to Mars and lead an invasion fleet back.
