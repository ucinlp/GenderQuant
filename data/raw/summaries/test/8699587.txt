The Pink Panther spends the day at {{not a typo}} Beach, arriving on his motorcycle. With him is a suitcase full of strange inflatable items, including muscles, weights, a swimming pool, waterskis, and balloon animals. Observing all of this is an egotistical strongman flexing his muscles for a group of bathing beauties. The panther quietly manages to steal the attention of the ladies away from the muscleman, who tries in vain to maintain his "good looking guy on the beach" status.Beck, Jerry.
