Remembrance is an unusual wartime romance, inspired by two true but little-known stories: a man with an extremely rare memory condition, synesthesia, which literally prevented him from forgetting; and Camp X â€“ a top secret training facility near Whitby, Ontario, that was used to train Canadian and Allied spies during World War Two. Against this backdrop, two strangers meet and, each for their own reasons, must struggle against an unexpected and dangerous attraction.
