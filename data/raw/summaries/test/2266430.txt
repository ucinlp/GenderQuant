A couple of bandits, Cat and Hutch, have robbed his bank, so the bank's president takes a chance. He saves condemned outlaw Cacopoulous from hanging and hires him to go catch the thieves and get his money back. The scheme backfires because the bank president is one of the men who caused him to be sentenced to prison in the first place, so Cacopoulos shoots him dead. He searches for the missing money, finds it, then loses it gambling. He also hunts for Drake, another of the men who sent him to jail. Cat and Hutch turn up and form a partnership with Cacopoulos, agreeing to work together to get the money back and then split it three ways. They end up gambling for it in a casino, after which Cacopoulos finally has his showdown with Drake.
