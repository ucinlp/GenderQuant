The film revolves around two people. Lal is an ambitious guy who wants to start his own business and make it big in life. Das is a loudmouth, and a very arrogant person. The two manage to get hold of 5000 rupees and they open a vada pav centre. As luck would have it, Lal wins Rs. 2 lakhs in a contest. The duo plan to start a travel agency. Since they do not have enough money to buy a vehicle, they use spare parts of old cars to create a bus. Trusting Das to come up with a good make of a bus, he blindly hands over the prize money to him. Lal manages to get passengers for their first ride. But when the bus comes all hell breaks loose with people demanding their money back. But when the passengers are forced to ride in it, it leads to a rat race for them and the bus owner duo, for some golden ornaments, which they somehow manage to find under a statue which they pulled down, but the gold is seized by the police. After the police are off with the gold, the passengers as well as the bus owner duo begin to repent their greed and decide to do a "philanthropic" job by fixing the fallen statue. But trying to fix the statue they manage to break it into pieces. Inside is a pack of diamonds. Lal thanks God for the reward and everybody gets their share of the diamonds.
