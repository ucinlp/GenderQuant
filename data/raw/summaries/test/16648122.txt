Joe and Betty, husband and wife, own and run a small Jersey City fish market. They have a son, Danny, who has left for Los Angeles to try to become an actor. The job is Joe's main focus in life, and he tends to neglect Betty at home. Into their life comes Nick, a young man drifting through town. Joe and Betty take a liking to Nick and offer him a job as well as lodging in Danny's old room. Nick becomes an apprentice to Joe at work, showing an interest in the business that Danny never did. Nick also shows an interest in Betty, and it's mutual. By the time Danny returns home, he finds that he has been all but replaced in the family by a surrogate brother, and he also rightly suspects that this interloper is having an affair with his mother.
