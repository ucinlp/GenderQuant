The movie is set at St. Francis Academy , a fictional all-girls Catholic boarding school in Pennsylvania, operated by an order of nuns. Russell plays the Mother Superior, who spends the movie at odds with Mary Clancy , a rebellious teenager, and her misery-loves-company friend Rachel Devery . The episodic storyline follows the young women through their sophomore, junior and senior high-school years. After spending much of the film resenting the authority of the Mother Superior, Mary receives the "call" senior year and, after graduation, remains at the school in the novitiate of the order.
