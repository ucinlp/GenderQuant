Chiranjeevi plays the dual roles of a Mumbai-based auto driver, Johnny, and an industrialist, Kalyan, who because he was interfering with the plans of the villains, led by Kota Srinivasa Rao, is first temporarily replaced by Johnny, and then framed for the murder of Kalyan's trusted employee, Shobana. Johnny realizes that he ruined the life of a good man and joins forces with Kalyan. They pretend to be each other, in order to save Kalyan. After the villains prove in court that Kalyan was the killer by replacing the rod of the murder weapon with one that has his finger prints on it, Johnny captures the villains and saves Kalyan. This is one of the biggest hits of chiranjeevi and commercially a huge success. Still the re-releases of the film is attracted by huge crowds although the film is telecasted many times on the national media. Chiranjeevi and Bappilahiri's combination was always created magic.The songs were huge hit and chiru's comedy timing is best as ever.Ever Beautiful Divya bharati is an asset for this flick. Chiranjeevi's dance in the song "Amalapuram Bulloda" was exceptional.
