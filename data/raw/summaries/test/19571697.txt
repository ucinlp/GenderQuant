Judge Jagdish Verma  has an accused by the name of Yogi Shankar  in his courtroom. Judge Verma was once Yogi's defence lawyer, but now must pass a sentence against him. Yogi pleads his innocence, but the Judge finds him guilty, and Yogi is sentenced to a long term  in jail. Yogi swears to avenge this injustice and humiliation. Judge Verma's family consists of Urmila , two sons, Karan and Kunal , and a daughter Tina . Yogi serves out his term and is released from jail, seeking revenge against Juge Verma and his family. He abducts young Tina and plans to use her to control the judge and his judgments. The family is instructed not to contact the police, for the safety of Tina, and to keep this abduction a secret. Tina  grows up in the company of Yogi and his men, without knowing her real parents and her brothers. Tina is then used to ensnare the family into more deceit and entrapment under the direction of Yogi, leaving the Verma family no choice but to go along with Yogi's plan.
