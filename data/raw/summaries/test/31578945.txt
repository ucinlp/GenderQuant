A nun, Sister Sarah, is neglected and abused by a corrupted clergy. On the verge of death after being heavily drugged and wounded the nun receives a commandment from God to take revenge against those who have sinned. After acquiring heavy weaponry, the nun seeks to kill those who had previously abused her. In response, the church hires the "Los Muertos" motorcycle gang to track her down and kill her.
