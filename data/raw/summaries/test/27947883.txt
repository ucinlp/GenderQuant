W.E. tells the story of two fragile but determined women – Wally Winthrop  and Wallis Simpson – separated by more than six decades. In 1998, lonely New Yorker Winthrop is obsessed with what she perceives as the ultimate love story: King Edward VIII's abdication of the British throne for the woman he loved, American divorcée Wallis Simpson. But Winthrop's research, including several visits to the Sotheby's auction of the Windsor Estate, reveals that the couple's life together was not as perfect as she thought. Weaving back and forth in time, the film intertwines Wally's journey of discovery in New York with the story of Wallis  and Edward , from the glamorous early days of their romance to the slow unraveling of their lives in the decades that followed.<ref namehttp://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-weinstein-company-acquires-madonnas-we-for-us-release-123754124.html|title2011-06-14|accessdatePRNewswire}}
