The picture tells of Roy "Mad Dog" Earle , an aging bank robber who intends to pull off one last heist before retiring. Sprung from prison by crime boss Big Mac , Earle agrees to plan the robbery of a resort hotel. His partners include the hotheaded Babe , Red , and Louis Mendoza , as the "inside man." Along for the ride is Marie , a dance-hall girl whom Babe recently met. Marie falls in love with Earle, but he is more interested in Velma , the club-footed daughter of a farmer  whom Earle had earlier befriended. Intending to use his share of the loot to pay for Velma's needed operation, Earle goes through with the robbery, only to be thwarted by the ineptitude of his gang, the treachery of the late Big Mac's successors, and the fickle Velma. With the still faithful Marie by his side, Earle makes a desperate escape into the High Sierras, but noir fate is against him.
