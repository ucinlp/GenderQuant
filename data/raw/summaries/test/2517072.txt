She calls into a radio station and requests a song, repeating the words left on the note. An anonymous man calls in soon after, stating that he is the one who had written the letter and he would like to meet her someday since they seem to be one in the same. The radio announcer, Bingo, sets up a date and time for their meeting at the radio station. The day comes and the man  arrives but finds only a letter waiting for him. The letter does not state her name or address, only a Post Box number to which she requests him to write to so that they may become friends. So, the correspondence begins. The man turns out to be photographer Rahul Sharma . They do not meet, exchange numbers or tell their names to each other but they continue to write to each other.
