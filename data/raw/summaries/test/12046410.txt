Drake performs a song called, "Makes Me Happy" for a music deal. While at Spin City Records, they agree to put Drake's song on a commercial that will air during the Super Bowl. In the meantime, Helen is getting married and her grandmother, Lula, comes to stay at Drake and Josh's house for a week, forcing Megan to share the boys' room. Helen then announces the new assistant manager, who turns out to be Mindy Crenshaw. Josh is very upset that he didn't get the job, and accuses Mindy of constantly trying to one-up him, which she denies. While at the recording studio at Spin City Records, the producer, Alan Kirm, gives Josh a contract. Josh doesn't read the contract at all, mesmerized by massive shrimp . Josh inadvertently signs away the creativity rights to Drake's song. The producer remixes -- and completely ruins -- Drake's song, turning it into, as Drake puts it, "horrible bubblegum pop garbage-y badness". Furious with Josh for his mistake, Drake fires him as manager, then hatches a plan for revenge: planting fruit flies in the Alan's car. While criticizing Josh for always playing by the rules , he tells Josh that, "when people play dirty, sometimes you have to play dirty back." Still trying to fix his mistake, Josh returns to Spin City Records. After being told there is no way the company will use Drake's original song, Josh decides to take Drake's advice and switches the ruined song with the original song as it is being picked up. The plan succeeds, and Drake's version of "Makes Me Happy" plays on the commercial, much to Drake's delight , but with a price. Right after the commercial airs, Josh receives a call from Alan Krim. By switching the songs, Josh has broken a legally binding contract, and not only is the record company planning to sue the boys for $5 million, the two could also go to prison. While at work, Josh realizes that Mindy did not take the job as assistant manager because she needed the extra money; she did it in order to spend time with Josh. Then, the boys go to Spin City Records, and just as they think they are going to jail, Drake is told his song has become a number one hit, as downloads of his song crashed Spin City's server. They are free of all charges and Alan Krim is fired for trying to ruin Drake's song . At Helen's wedding, amidst a few small disasters, Josh and Mindy get back together. Mindy has quit her job and Josh becomes the new assistant manager. Drake also rehires him as his manager. Then, Drake performs his number one hit song to the whole crowd. Afterwards, Drake and Josh return home to find shrimp sent over from Nick Matteo. Megan and her friends have eaten all but one, which causes Drake and Josh to fight over it, mimicking a similar scene from The Amanda Show, which is shown during the credits.
