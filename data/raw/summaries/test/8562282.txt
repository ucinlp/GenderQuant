Marshall uncovers CTX, a covert military drug so secret that an arm of the military headed by a man named Werner ([[Danny Webb  wants Marshall eliminated. And Tia was one of the two military scientists who developed CTX. As it turns out, Reina , the hooker who killed Marshall's team, was under the influence of CTX, which turns whoever is under its influence into a seemingly unstoppable killer. A Paris night club owner named Aroon  was the other military scientist who helped develop CTX, and now, Aroon has plans to release the CTX into the water supply in Paris, which would turn the city's residents into ultra-violent killers.
