The head says that it isn't right to marry off the maid to a wealthier man to Meera's father, Here Meera's father says that Meera is her daughter not the maid, and Priyadarshan didn't believe it at first thinking it was a drama to not give her to him until Meera admits it. Priyadarshan hearing this tears up then says "you were cheating me, weren't you?" and then apologizes to Meera's father. While Priyadarshan is about leave he says in tears that he has never lied to anyone and that he doesn't have many dreams but marrying Meera was the only dream in his life, which has been destroyed to the head.
