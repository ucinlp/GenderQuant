The charming dodger Rosco Frazer and the recently released convict Doug Oâ€™Riordan meet each other during a rough brawl in a roadhouse. After this they drive off in a truck, each one thinking of the other as the trucker. Not long afterwards a highway patrol stops them for speeding, and since they cannot produce proper papers, they are mistaken for truck-jackers the police has been looking for. Thanks to Rosco being a ventriloquist however, they are able to get away. Doug would rather run off alone but can't get rid of Rosco. Together they drive to the airport in order to go into hiding there. Since the flight to Miami is already booked up, they pose as Steinberg and Mason who had just been called for on the speaker. They get their tickets, not knowing their original purchasers are two CIA top agents; as such, they are given a suitcase containing one million dollars to transport. After various mishaps and entanglements they are taken to the CIA headquarters to meet "Tiger", their new boss. There they are asked on several occasions to omit various embarrassing incidents, which would cast a bad light on the CIA staff involved, from their final report. In order to track down a mysterious secret organization hiding in Miami Beach, Rosco and Doug are tasked to impersonate rich Texans. They succeed quite well at this and in the end manage to track down K1, a megalomanic criminal, who wants to erase mankind's understanding of all numbers with his "K-Bomb", plunging the world into chaos. They put a stop to his plan, but in the end they can't benefit from their perks and can't enjoy the million dollars because an overeager "Tiger" has already given the money back to the government; a visit to the president is all they get out of it.
