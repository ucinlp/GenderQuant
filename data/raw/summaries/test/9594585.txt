Actor-director Maurice "Maury" Novak  works with actor Sam Lawson  in an early grassroots theatrical group later targeted as "subversive" for its liberal views. Novak leaves the theater to become a well-known Hollywood director until he is brought down by the blacklist himself. Both men know Sharon Kensington , who is the alcoholic daughter of powerful Broadway producer Robert Kensington . Lawson continually tries to establish himself as an actor, suffering the slings and arrows of rejection despite his dedication and passion for the theater. It costs him his first wife, played by Joan Blackman. Lawson's long-suffering agent Shirley Drake  attempts to get him work and he slowly begins to rise, even managing to land work in a Kensington production. Just as he's about to land a major role in a TV series, his loyalty is researched and the ties to his allegedly "subversive" theater work with Novak are revealed. As Novak has been wrongly brought down, the now-blacklisted Lawson, reflecting the realities of real-life blacklisted actors, is forced to take work as a waiter. In one sense this was among Hollywood's first direct documentations of the blacklist in a dramatic film. Novak, himself on the skids, returns, vowing to start fresh with a new off-Broadway theater. He offers Lawson a chance to work together again. After agonizing, Lawson accepts the offer, and with the blacklist past, the new play becomes successful and heads to Broadway. With Lawson finally emerging as a major actor, Drake, who has fallen in love with Lawson, asks him in the final scene, thinking of his struggles and humiliation, if it was "worth it." "Yes," says Lawson. "It was worth it."
