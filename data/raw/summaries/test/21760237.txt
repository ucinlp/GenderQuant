After serving time in gaol, Lebanese Australian John Morkos returns home. He finds work as a cleaner at a boxing gym, owned by an Aboriginal man. John also meets and begins a relationship with Sydney, an Anglo Australian after saving her from being assaulted by two men. John soon finds that his younger brother, Charlie, has been involved in fights between his Lebanese friends and the white students at school. Fearing that Charlie is going down the path he has been on, John tries to talk some sense into Charlie. Charlie ignores John's warnings and with his friend Zeus start selling methamphetamines for Ibo, the local drug kingpin. Not long after that, another one of Charlie's friends, Tom, punches a stranger in the head, after playing and losing an arcade game to him. The stranger's friend gets involved in the fight and later on Tom's friends join in. The stranger's friend holds Zeus in a headlock during the fight and while doing so Tom stabs him with a knife and ends up in jail. Meanwhile, John and Sydney's relationship blossoms. At school, tensions between the Lebanese and Anglo boys increase. The Anglos, led by Scott, gang-bash one of the Lebanese boys, breaking his jaw and nose. The rest of the Lebanese boys decide to take revenge on Scott but are persuaded by John not to do anything. Meanwhile, the relationship between John and Sydney blossoms but ends when Sydney's racist mother threatens to kick her out of the house if she doesn't stop seeing John. The two had a fight with John unwilling to tell Sydney of his past life. The couple soon make up after realising they both made a mistake. John also finds Charlie's stash of drugs and flushes it down the toilet. At a nightclub, Zeus starts a fight with Scott, punches him in the head and ends up shooting and killing him despite Charlie's attempts to dissuade him. Zeus is arrested by the police. Unable to come up with the drug money for Ibo, a drive-by shooting is carried out on the Morkos home by Ibo. John turns to the owner of the boxing gym for the money which he delivers to Ibo, but Charlie is murdered by Ibo with a shotgun when walking home from school. John avenges Charlie's death by savagely beating Ibo, and in the process, nearly killing him. John decides to leave Ibo's fate to Ibo's neighbours, who also hate the drug dealer, and returns home to his family and a pregnant Sydney.
