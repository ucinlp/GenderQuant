Triad boss Lin Ho-Lung is celebrating his son's first birthday, the child having been conceived from his mistress. The party, however, is interrupted when Police Inspector Liu Chi-Chung arrives outside of the club with his colleagues, warning the gang of throwing any parties without the police's consent. Police officers raid a drug shipment involving Tung, Lung’s right-hand man and assassin, Lok Tin-Hung, and Wu, a drug dealer. A gunfight ensues between both the police and triads, resulting in Wu’s arrest. As Wu remains uncooperative with the police, his wife Tracy  talks with Soso, threatening to have Wu expose Lung's gang, if she does not receive $20 million. Tung and Tin-Hung torture Tracy, who reveals that the threat was bogus and that her secret lover coerced her into creating a lie so she could flee with him once she had gotten the money. The gang executes Tracy’s lover, and breaks into police headquarters to assassinate Wu. Various police officers and Triad gang members are killed as the Triads try to escape the precinct. Soso and Fat are revealed to be blackmailing Lung and his gang. They orchestrate a kidnapping of Lung's financial backer, Uncle Yu . After receiving $200 million from Lung, Soso and Fat kill the hired kidnappers and Uncle Yu to cover their tracks. Lung and Tung eventually start a war against a rival Triad gang whom they suspect was responsible for the murder. Lung later has a meeting with his rival, Flirt , a gang leader who reveals he had nothing to do with Yu’s death. Tung learns about Soso and Fat's role in Yu's killing. Lung goes after the couple, resulting in a shootout. After Fat is eliminated, Lung catches up to Soso whom he refuses to kill, after she expresses her bitterness about her inability to conceive and Lung's decision to have a child from a mistress. She is later arrested by the police. Lung and Tin-Hung are trapped in a warehouse and surrounded by the police outside. Knowing that they will be unable to escape, Tin-Hung mentions that he was never convinced by the stories that claim Lung was an "invincible fighter." Lung accepts Tin-Hung's challenge. The fight ends with Lung impaling Tin-Hung with a pipe. While dying, Tin-Hung expresses that he forgives Lung, and hopes that he will soon join him after he dies. Refusing to surrender to the police, Lung walks out of the warehouse, armed with machine guns. He intimidates the police by firing the weapons, and is shot to death. As Soso is serving prison time, assassins disguised as painters slit her throat. Tung attempts to flee with Lung's mistress and their baby son. They arrive at a beach, presumably to escape via boat. Tung asks her to wait while he looks for the boat. Several shadowy figures approach the mistress. The ending is left ambiguous as the last shot of the film is a silencer aiming at Tung. It is uncertain as to who orders the assassinations.
