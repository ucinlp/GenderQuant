Raja is a minor league crook who sells railway tickets on the black market at Amirpur Station. Tired of his job he looks for new ways to make a quick buck. One day, along with his friend Ghafoor  and a police inspector , he robs Rs 2.5 million from the railway treasury. Later, Raja and Ghafoor bump off the inspector and run away with the loot to Bombay. At Bombay airport, Raja sets eyes on psychiatrist Dr Neha  and promptly falls in love with her. Raja and Ghafoor quickly find out where she lives. Ghafoor pretends to be a psychiatric patient while Raja takes on the name Raj Kumar and befriends her, telling her he has just returned from the U.S. However, Ghafoor cautions Raja not to hurry and be patient in matters of love. The trouble begins when Bunnu , the son of a wealthy businessman , is sent to Neha for treatment. He is crazy, and terrified of fire, heights, running, and water. Soon, he too falls for Neha and discovers he has a rival who is Raja. Suddenly, Neha has to leave for Ooty with her father  to attend her uncle's  wedding. She does not leave behind a forwarding address. Both Raja and Bunnu impersonate policemen and intimidate her secretary into revealing where she is. Dr Neha is thrilled to see them in Ooty but is drawn closer to the ill Bunnu rather than Raja. Things take an ugly turn when Ghafoor tries to kill Bunnu, who escapes. Bunnu contacts contract killer Pappu Pager  to bump off Raja. However, that plan too comes a cropper. Armed with a gold ring and garland, Neha calls Bunnu and Raja to court, ostensibly with the purpose of marriage. Both are surprised to see the other there. Then they find out, Neha was getting married to someone else, Prem . Raveena Tandon makes a special appearance in the end.
