In West Virginia, Charles "Boomer" Baxter is controlling the position of mountain top-depletion blasts. He detonates the TNT, and an enormous earthquake devastates the area. After a few hours, Dr. Amy Lane, a government seismologist, reaches the quake's epicenter. Dr. Lane realizes that the primary quake has opened a deep fault which runs through the center of North America, and if the fault comes in contact with the San Andreas Fault, it will cause massive earthquakes and tsunamis that will devastate Los Angeles, San Francisco, and other cities in the West Coast and many countries in the Pacific Ocean, leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands. Dr. Lane and Boomer must run toward the mighty break in the ground, inventing a plan to stop the next quake. they decide to use a satelite dish that makes earthquakes. They decide to fire it when they reach the Grand Canyon, thinking that when it hits the canyon the satellite will force it go south to the Gulf of Mexico. When the fault reaches the canyon, they fire the satellite at the fault but the plan goes wrong. Instead of the fault heading south the fault goes north, towards the Yellowstone caldera  and realizing if it reaches the whole caldera would erupt, sending 2,000,000 tonnes of ash into the air which could kill millions of people. So they decide to put explosives. Later, when it reaches the park, the boomer detonates the explosives causing the fault to stop just inches from reaching the volcano. But it costed the boomer's life. At last when the camera zooms into space, a giant fault that is miles wide is shown.
