The Pink Panther becomes a lumberjack like cartoon number 53, and runs into trouble when the axe blade flies off and cuts down the incorrect tree, which destroys the manager's car as it falls down. The panther is then given a chainsaw but which immediately gets a mind of its own and starts chasing the panther until he manages to crush it with a wooden mallet. He instead applies a beaver to chew a tree down.
