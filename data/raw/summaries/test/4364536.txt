The story begins with a narration by Alejandro Lopez as he retells the events of his father's life,Juan Lopez , and how by selling oranges changed their lives. Juan was born on a strawberry field in Bakersfield, California, but due to hardship, his mother decided to relocate to Mexico. Now Juan is an undocumented citizen, due to no proof of US citizenship, of Los Angeles, struggling not only to get a green card, but to solely care for Alejandro, after his wife's death. Yet, he has no documentation to attest to his U.S. citizenship and lives as an undocumented worker in Los Angeles selling oranges near the freeway. He lives with two roommates and tries to make ends meet so he can take care of his little son. He is stressed as he battles landlords and immigration. A stranger  in a fancy limousine hands over $1,000,000 dollar check to Juan, but there is a catch! He must give the money back, all of it, in one month. Juan is suspicious and takes the check to his immigration worker  who encourages him to follow the directions given him. At first he uses the check to get credit extended at posh clothing stores, a car dealership, and more. He also meets a woman in a dead-end relationship with a bossy businessman. Then the fun begins for good-natured Juan Lopez, who has to avoid temptations and the greedy people that suddenly pop-up in his life. Juan comes to realize that the true meaning of life is love, family, and happiness, and that money isn't the answer.
