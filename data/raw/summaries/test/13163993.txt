Giovanni Vivaldi  is a petty bourgeois, modest white collar worker nearing retirement in a public office in the capital. His life is divided between work and family. With his wife  he shares high hopes for his son, Mario , a newly qualified accountant and a very bright boy who willingly assists in the efforts which his father employs to make it in the same office. The father, in an attempt to guide his son, emphasizes the point of practicing humility in the presence of his superiors at work, and has him enroll in a Masonic lodge to help him gain friendships and favoritisms that, at first, he would never hope to have. Just as the attempts of Giovanni Vivaldi seems to turn to success, his son Mario is killed, hit by a stray bullet during a shootout that erupts following a robbery in which the father and son are accidentally involved. Misfortune and sufferings consequently distort the lives, beliefs and morality of the Vivaldi spouses. The wife of Giovanni becomes ill, loses her voice and becomes seriously handicapped. Giovanni, now blinded by grief and hatred, throws himself headlong into an isolated and desperate quest, which takes him first to identify his child's murderer and then to evade police capture. He abducts his son's murderer, takes him to a secluded cabin and submits him to torture and violence, eventually bringing the killer of his child to a slow death. Then, for Giovanni arrives - at his set date - his retirement and, only a day later, the death of his wife who had by now been overcome by her disability. Giovanni is now prepared with serenity and resignation to live into old age, but a spontaneous verbal confrontation with a young idler revives in him the role of an executioner who will, presumably, kill again.
