 Two former backup soul singers, Louis Hinds  and Floyd Henderson , who have not spoken to each other in 30 years, reluctantly agree to travel across the country together to a reunion concert to honor their recently deceased lead singer, Marcus Hooks . Cleo , a beautiful young woman in an abusive relationship, who is believed to be Floyd's daughter but is really Louis' daughter, accompanies them as a new singer. A few problems come their way, involving Cleo's wanna-be gangsta rapper boyfriend, Lester , Floyd's fling with Rosalee  and a lot more leading up to their big performance at the Apollo Theater, and the duo reform a bond that they lost 30 years ago.  The film opens with a biography of a legendary R&B/Soul male group: Marcus Hooks & The Real Deal, in which later in 1977, after years of success since 1972, they disbanded; Marcus became a successful solo artist, while Louis Hinds and Floyd Henderson, Marcus's former bandmates, broke up later in 1979, with Louis in drugs and struggling and Floyd becoming successful again as a spirited entrepreneur. In 2008, it is found out that Marcus has passed away by a fatal heart attack in Sweden, meaning Floyd and Louis are called to come back together again as "The Real Deal" for a tribute performance in honor of their lead singer. The two have not spoken to one another since their break-up, having been holding a grudge on each other, due to their own differences about having a successful life. However, as they remember some of their most successful songs, their long-lost bond and friendship slowly begin to restore as they continue to make their way to the Apollo Theater. However, as they continue their journey, they run into more trouble: their car runs out of gas, and a gangster rapper named Lester, who doesn't hesitate to sample their baseline for his new song, leading to a fight, in which a young woman, Cleo, intervenes. Lester disses them and threatens to repeat even more if the two men spend more time with her than with him. Cleo is heard singing later that night, and is discovered that she has a great voice; however, Lester later founds out this and hits her. The next morning, she tells Louis what happened to her last night. This proves to be the last straw for Louis: he knocks Lester with his gun, gropes him, and forces him to apologize for what he has done earlier, as well as giving him the money for the gas, in which he reluctantly agrees.
