The story goes that the Pink Panther visits a laundromat, and initially has trouble getting his laundry to stay inside the washing machine without coming out from a nearby machine. While struggling with this problem, the panther gets stuck in a bucket. With only his hands and feet sticking out, he attracts the attention of a little dog, who barks angrily at the bucket that runs, slaps his face and gets him wet with a fire hydrant. When the little pointy-nosed man walks into the laundromat, more mishaps occur with a soap vending machine, a vat full of starched water, and the laundromat getting flooded with soap.
