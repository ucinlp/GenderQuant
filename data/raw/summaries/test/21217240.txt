The film explores the life of 18-year-old Ben, shortly after earning his degree from an unnamed high school in Maryland. Ben is heading to Senior Week to hang out with friends, party, and chase the hottest girl in high school, Annie . The movie begins outside a liquor store in Columbia, located between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. in Howard County. Ben is talking to himself when Ben's older brother's friend Brian  overhears him, which embarrasses Ben. Ben's older brother Josh  gets in the car and hands Ben a bag of liquor. They then drive to pick up Ben's three friends, Andy, Mattie and Nickie. After picking up Ben's three friends, the group heads off to Ocean City. During the trip to Ocean City the group has discussions about sex, which highlights the group's limited understanding of sex and their naivete. Upon arriving in Ocean City the group gets drunk and goes to a party. After entering the party, Josh tells the boys "the secret" about female body language. Later at the party Ben talks to Megs , his best friend. As they talk, Annie enters the party. Her entrance completely distracts Ben. Ben then sits down next to Annie and flirts with her. As Ben and Annie begin to kiss, Nickie gets into a fight, which causes Annie to leave and ends the party. The next day, the group goes out on the town, has fun at the beach, and cruises the boardwalk. They end up back at Ben's condo and play Asshole. Andy becomes president and declares that Nickie must toast him. After a brief verbal spat, Ben becomes Vice President and calls for a confession. After a descriptive story from Josh about losing his virginity, the boys stumble into an awkward conversation about divorce. Throughout the rest of the week the viewer meets many more characters that come in and out of the story line.
