After being taken from his home in Africa, Joe is an instant hit in the Hollywood nightclub "The Golden Safari" , but the novelty wears off and he is tired and homesick after seventeen weeks of performing. An ill-conceived skit with Jill as an organ-grinder leaves Joe  storming off-stage, and, to make matters worse, three drunks sneak backstage and ply Joe with liquor. Intoxicated, he breaks out of his cage and into the club, his rampage turning lions loose and inflicting massive damage. A court orders him shot. Jill, Gregg, and O'Hara cook up a plan to get Joe out of the country, but on the way to a ship, they stop to rescue children from a burning orphanage, and Joe redeems himself. The film ends with O'Hara receiving home movies from his friends in Africa, letting the audience know that Joe is going to be all right.
