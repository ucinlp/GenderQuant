Rush is a solitary survivor in a post-nuclear holocaust world. Water is scarce, as is plant life, and often fought to the death for. Rush discovers that water is being hoarded by the evil Yor and becomes a one man army to save the world. In the Australian version of the film not only is the dubbing hilarious but also there are two characters called Steel, reused footage, and even the soundtrack is just a compilation of tracks from other De Masi films.
