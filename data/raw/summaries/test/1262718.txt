High school student Candy  seemingly descends to Earth from space. In the relatively simple plot, she naively endures an escalating series of situations in which her oblivious allure triggers satirical porn-film-like encounters. Roger Ebert wrote, "Candy caroms from one man to another like a nympho in a pinball machine, and the characters she encounters are improbable enough to establish Terry Southern's boredom with the conventions of pornography."<ref name/19681226/REVIEWS/812260301/1023 Review: Candy ] Chicago Sun Times Last accessed 2010-03-23. In school, her father  is also her teacher. At a poetry recital, eccentric poet MacPhisto  offers Candy a ride home in his limousine. At her home, MacPhisto drunkenly waxes boisterously poetic, arousing Candy and her gardener Emanuel  into sex. Scandalized, her family sends her to private school, where she embarks on a psychedelic journey during which she meets a number of strange people, including a sex starved military general , a doctor who performs public operations , a hunchback  and a fake Indian guru . As the film ends, she continues to cavort with other people plus some of the characters she met in the film, followed by her return to outer space.
