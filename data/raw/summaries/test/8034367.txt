Mr Bradbury , an apparently posh and well-educated, ex-military Englishman is hired as tutor to the son of a Japanese ambassador, Koichi Kagoyama . Bradbury becomes a trusted friend, who boasts about himself during his British Army service being a hero telling him "war stories", but some painful truths are revealed after he and the boy are kidnapped by political terrorists. It comes to the point when Mr Bradbury has to live up to the "action man" he makes himself out to be.
