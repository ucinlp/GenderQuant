The Stooges are sailors employed in a ships' tailor shop. The three steal some officers' uniforms in order to go ashore. While pretending to be an Admiral, Curly and his "aides"  are tricked into stealing a submarine by a pair of spies. The Stooges eventually capture the spies, but whilst reenacting the capture for the real Admiral, Curly accidentally detonates a bomb.{{cite web}}
