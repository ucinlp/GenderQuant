A plumber's niece  and a refugee  meet in England prior to World War II, and Una O'Connor, Peter Lawford, Helen Walker, Reginald Gardiner, C. Aubrey Smith, Reginald Owen, and Richard Haydn are around to take up what slack there is. Cluny Brown  is a free spirit, who lives in the moment. She has been told, she has to learn her place, and in 1938 England there is much protocol and rules to follow. She has a difficult time not being able to be herself, until she meets Adam Belinski  who finds her spontaneity intoxicatingly refreshing. A plumber's niece, she has a fascination with plumbing and pipes which get her into trouble, as it is not lady like, and Uncle decides to send her into domestic service. From there things get even more fun.
