Vishal  is a respectable and honest officer. One day Vishal is abducted and killed in the presence of his younger brother, Jugnu , who is missing and considered to be dead. In reality he is taken in by a jungle tribe, where the chief  trains him. Honest and diligent Gandhian Raghunath gets very angry by seeing this situation, and demands from the Chief Minister, Omiji, to step into the picture. When Omiji attempts to inquire into this, his son is incriminated for selling tainted glucose in hospitals, which caused to several deaths. Powerless to act, Omiji hesitates, and as a result Raghunath is killed. Thereafter, Jugnu returns, now a one man army, willing to avenge his brother's death.
