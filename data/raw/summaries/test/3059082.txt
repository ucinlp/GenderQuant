On Christmas Eve in Wichita, Kansas, mob lawyer Charlie Arglist  and crooked businessman and pornographer Vic Cavanaugh  gather together the $2 million they have stolen from their mob boss Bill Guerrard . While it initially appears that there will be an easy getaway for the pair, they learn that the roads in and out of the city are too icy to drive on. Vic takes the cash for safe-keeping and they split up and try their best to evade being captured by Guerrard and his men, who have discovered their scheme. Charlie visits Sweet Cage, a local strip-club, owned by Renata Crest , a woman whom Charlie has long lusted for, and she quickly deciphers that he's hiding something. He hints at the existence of the money, and she suggests they go off together. Before they can do that, however, she tasks Charlie to find an incriminating picture of a local politician, at a hotel. Charlie goes there and runs into his friend Pete , who is married to Charlie's beautiful ex-wife. Pete is very drunk, and tags along with Charlie for as long as it takes for Pete to pass out. Charlie goes back to Renata and gives her the photo, and she tells him that Vic had called her earlier and said that Charlie had been right about mob enforcer Roy Gelles ([[Mike Starr  tailing the two of them. Charlie goes to Vic's house and finds Vic's wife dead. Vic arrives and reveals that he's locked Roy in an industrial trunk. The two stuff Roy, in the trunk, in Charlie's ex-wife's Mercedes  and head for a local lake. On the way, Roy continues yelling at the two of them, and Vic gets annoyed and shoots at the trunk. Charlie and Vic get the trunk down to the dock, but it's shot open from the inside and Roy gets out, shooting Vic in the process. A shootout ensues, ending with Roy dead and Vic fallen into the frozen lake. Charlie realizes that Vic was going to kill Charlie and take the money for himself, and leaves Vic to die. Returning to Sweet Cage, Charlie finds that Bill Guerrard himself has come and tied Renata up. Charlie finds a shotgun in the bar and turns it on Guerrard. Another shootout ensues, with Charlie being injured and Guerrard killed. Charlie and Renata go back to her house, and Charlie finds the money hidden there. It's revealed via flashback that Vic and Renata were planning to go off together after Vic had killed Charlie. Charlie kills Renata just before she can kill him. Charlie and Pete then drive off together, deciding to make new names for themselves.
