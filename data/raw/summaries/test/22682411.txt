Shantanu Arya  is a glamour photographer and a thorough womaniser. Namrata Shorey  is a journalist and is quite amazingly in love with Shantanu even though she knows about his womanising ways. All her requests for marriage fall on deaf ears, as Shantanu consistently avoids commitment of any sort. Slowly she starts getting tired of his wayward ways and starts questioning her own thinking. Suddenly a young, rich man, Aakash  enters her life and provides her the much-needed respite from her mundane lifestyle. Aakash is apparently in love with her. But Namrata reminds him of their age difference and the fact that she has given herself tan aur man se to Shantanu. Meanwhile, sensing the growing proximity of Aakash and Namrata and getting rebukes from other girls, Shantanu finally agrees for the marriage. Namrata does a long wait for Shantanu at wedding place but he doesn't reach there till late night and finally as she exits from there, she finds Aakash there and at last, she accepts him which is the climax of this movie. {{cite web}}
