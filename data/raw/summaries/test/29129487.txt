She apologizes, and starts to enjoy spending time with both of the Thomases...and her friendship with Lucas makes her have doubts about her relationship with her almost fiance, Andrew. As the interview process goes on, it is revealed that Mrs. Thomas finds only silence about her husband for sixty-six years from the Department of the Navy.

Thomas was last seen. With the additional help of a United States Senator  who puts pressure on the Navy, they locate the family of Billings, the gunner on Thomas' airplane. The now deceased Billings' son tells of the crash and of Morang, a Filipino guerilla who rescued the wounded naval aviators.
