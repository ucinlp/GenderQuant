Tara Jane O'Neil is growing weary of her life at the Rocket House, a party pad filled with crashing slackers, artists, and rock bands. She works as a ticket taker at a movie theatre and hangs out with a group of friends who are equally aimless, skateboarding through the streets of Louisville, KY, and just generally waiting for their lives to start. Her brother, Otis , is the arrogant lead singer of a local rock group called the Guilloteens .http://www.allmusic.com/artist/boondoggle-mn0001324686, Artist "Boondoggle" at allmusic. are in awe of their noisy, chaotic sound. Even after their secret is revealed, their hosts give them encouragement and tutoring to allow Truckstop to continue on the road. What starts as a romantic adventure, though, degenerates into bickering, bad luck, and boredom. Eventually, the band members reconcile with one another and play a show with The Grifters, now as a refined and functional band. Their sound, though full of dissonance, now has a sense of melody and structure. Unfortunately, Otis is informed of Tara's whereabouts and sends the police after her. The police catch Tara and she is arrested, in an anti-climactic fashion.
