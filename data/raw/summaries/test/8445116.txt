The Stooges are small time actors traveling by rail to an engagementâ€”and fleeing the landlady for their unpaid rent. They are told to put their pet monkey, Joe, in the baggage car, but are afraid he will get hurt. They sneak Joe onto the Southern Pacific train with them, but Joe gets loose, managing to awaken and annoy all of the train's passengers, including Mr. Paul Pain  and Mr. Johnson . Ultimately, a terrified Joe pulls the train's emergency cord, abruptly stopping the train in the process. The passengers then forcibly remove the Stooges from the train.
