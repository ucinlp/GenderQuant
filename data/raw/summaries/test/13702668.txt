The Stooges are troubadours in medieval times. The villainous Black Prince has designs on marriage to Elaine, the princess. She however is in love with Cedric, the blacksmith. The Stooges try to intervene for Cedric by serenading Elaine; the music is the sextet from Donizetti's opera "Lucia di Lammermoor". They are captured by the king’s guards and condemned to be beheaded. Elaine sends them tools baked in a loaf of bread and they escape the dungeon. While running from the guards, Moe overhears the Black Prince plotting with a co-conspirator to murder the king. The Stooges save the day by causing a diversion by dancing in armor to Stephen Foster’s "Old Folks at Home", thus allowing Elaine to free Cedric. Finally, the king realizes the plot and jails the Black Prince and his fellow plotter. Elaine is allowed to marry Cedric, and they all live happily ever after.
