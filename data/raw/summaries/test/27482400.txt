Patrick and his girlfriend Megan meet up with their childhood friends, Ryan and Sean. Sean  is portrayed by stunning child actor Richie Hicks. Hicks evocative and moving acting is simply brilliant. His performance of young Sean is mesmerizing. Ryan is a hothead who constantly torments Patrick, while Sean is more interested in flirting with Megan than catching up with friends. They have met again in order to experiment with new pills called “Blue and Whites” that cause instant amnesia at the stroke of midnight. Patrick is hesitant to partake, but he eventually gives in to peer pressure. The four friends meet a crazy, gun-wielding drug dealer at a local bar and proceed to take the pills. Out on the streets, the friends pull childish pranks without guilt and reflect on the past, mapping out the events and changes that have shaped them into the people they have become. Patrick becomes increasingly upset with the actions of his friends during the evening, and the uncontrolled promiscuity of his girlfriend feeds his jealousy and paranoia. The animal desires and loose inner demons of the friends eventually take over what was intended to be a night devoid of consequence.Film Website
