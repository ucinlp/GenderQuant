By all appearances, Samantha  and Mason  are the picture perfect couple: young, attractive, successful, and madly in love. At her sister Allison’s  idyllic spring wedding, Samantha, a twenty-something fashion designer, finds herself irresistibly drawn back into the arms of her ex-boyfriend, James , a surprise wedding guest. Meanwhile, Mason, a published novelist just shy of thirty, spends a flirtatious evening culminating in a steamy hot tub encounter with his best friend Luke’s  18-year-old sister, Olivia . Carefully sneaking out of James’s room, Sam is startled by Mason and confesses her affair. But Mason’s reaction is not quite what is expected. So begins Fling. This twist on the classic love story addresses concerns that every couple must deal with: honesty, jealousy, commitment, maturity, understanding and ultimately the capacity for love.
