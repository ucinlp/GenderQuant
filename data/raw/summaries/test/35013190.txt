A blind violinist called Sibi has been singing and playing in cabarets in the most popular neighborhoods of Koudougou, Burkina Faso, for more than 30 years. He knows the origins of the ethnic groups and the most important family lines in the region. The film goes to the encounter of this extraordinary man who holds, despite himself and surrounded by general indifference, the living history of the region, and its oral traditions, now threatened with extinction. A message in a bottle before it is too late and these memories disappear forever.
