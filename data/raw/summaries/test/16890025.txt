Cantor Rabinowitz  is upset that his son Joey  has left home to pursue a career as a singer/comedian after showing no interest in carrying on the family's tradition of being Cantors in the synagogue. After five generations of doing so, it appears that Joey is more interested in making jokes and singing jazz music. After a few years on his own, Joey, who know calling himself Joey Robbins, gets an opportunity to perform on the television show with Ginny Gibbons . Unfortunately his father falls ill during his rehearsal performance and he runs to his side, putting show business aside for his family obligations.
