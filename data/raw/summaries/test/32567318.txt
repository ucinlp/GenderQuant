After twenty-five years in prison, Foley  is finished with the grifter's life. Prison and a lifetime in the game have stripped him of friends, family and a reason to get up in the morning. But when he meets an elusive young woman named Iris , the possibility of a new start looks real. Yet his past is proving to be a stubborn companion: Ethan ([[Luke Kirby , the son of his former partner, wants to learn the game–and who better to learn from than the closest thing he has to a father? And he has the perfect mark–his boss Xavier , a brutal man admired in the straight world for his business savvy, and feared in the underworld for his ruthlessness. Xavier is coming to town, and there is an easy $8 million to be had if they know how to play smart. The play is an old classic con–"The Samaritan"–the inside man, the outside man, the catch and the mark. It is a dangerous and high-risk setup requiring nerves of steel, precision timing and a bit of finesse to make it convincing. Foley could do it in his sleep–if he wanted to. But he does not and he will not. That is until Ethan raises the stakes and plays some cards that Foley never knew were in the deck. He is trapped and the con is on.
