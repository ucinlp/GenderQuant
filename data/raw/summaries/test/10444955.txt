It is 1978 and 15 year old Tomboy Gracie Bowen , who lives in South Orange, New Jersey, is crazy about Soccer, as are her three brothers, neighbor, and former soccer star father . Although Gracie wants to join her brothers and father in the nightly practices, she is discouraged by everyone except her elder brother, Johnny . The game at their school Columbia High School comes by with Johnny as the star soccer player on the Varsity team, the last shot is about to happen and he misses it. He then is sad, but gets over it. He then gets in his friend's car and drives off. Tragedy unexpectedly strikes when Johnny is killed in a car accident. Struggling with grief, Gracie decides that she wants to replace her brother on the team. Her father does not believe that girls should play soccer and tells her that she is neither tough nor talented enough to play with the boys team. Her mother, Lindsey Bowen , is a nurse who lacks the competitive drive of the rest of her family and fears for Gracie's safety. Lindsey later confesses to Gracie that she would have liked to become a Surgeon, but that option was not available to her as a woman. Feeling rejected and depressed, Gracie begins to rebel; she stops doing her schoolwork, is caught cheating on an exam, and experiments with wild and self-destructive behavior. She is finally caught by her father almost having sex with a guy she met near the docks when telling her friend "I want to do something that I've never done before." This serves as a "wake-up call" for her parents, particularly her father. He quits his job to coach her in soccer. When the school board rejects her request to play boy's soccer, it is revealed that he wanted her to play women's Field hockey. Gracie files an appeal with the school board. Citing the newly passed Title IX, Gracie argues that since a girl's soccer team does not exist, she should be allowed to play on the boy's varsity soccer team. The school board allows her to try out for the team. After very rough tryouts, she makes the Junior varsity team and has to decide if she is willing to play at that level. She decides to make the most of playing on junior varsity. One of the coaches asks her to come to the championship soccer game. After saying no at first she finally goes. Her team is up 1-0. The other team ends up scoring to make it 1-1. They go to a sudden death round, the first one to score wins, to see who wins. Their new captain, Kyle, gets hurt and Gracie goes in for him. She misses the free kick, but ends up scoring with the move that her dad taught her.
