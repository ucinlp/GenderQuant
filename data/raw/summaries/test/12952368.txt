In 1920s England, a group of upper-class people take part in an automobile race to Land's End. One couple, Billy and Angela,get lost in heavy fog and crash their car. Billy goes to look for help, but takes so long that Angela strikes out on her own. She eventually locates a rural estate owned by Dr. Lawrence, a former priest. He receives her kindly and sends his rodent-like gardener, Tom, to find her husband. Tom finds and murders Billy, and pushes the car into a ravine; it is implied that he acted on his employer's orders. Meanwhile Dr. Lawrence tells Angela about a trip his family took to India; his experiences with certain cults there so horrified him that he renounced religion in general. This decision was heavily influenced by the fate of his wife and son, who were converted to a new faith by a local nobleman. The former was afterwards so horrified by the things she had done that she committed suicide. Still waiting for Billy, Angela falls asleep in a guest room. Seeing this, the doctor's Indian housekeeper, Ayah, goes to the house's attic and lets out a bloated, bloodstained man in a priest's mantle. He kills Angela with a sacrificial knife, and Ayah ritually cooks the girl's flesh for him to eat. The first couple's relatives, Geoffery and Daphne Hunter, learn of Billy's death from the police and set out on a private mission to find Angela. They too wreck their car in the fog and are separated in the search for help. Angela locates the Lawrence estate first, and is abducted by Tom, who obviously hopes to rape her. When Dr. Lawrence discovers her presence, he reluctantly decides to offer her as another sacrifice to "the ghoul" in his attic. She is saved from molestation when Tom is sent out to get rid of Geoffery, who also found the house and was convinced by Dr. Lawrence that Angela and Daphne were both conveyed safely back to town. Tom botches the attempt to kill Geoffery, and is half sucked into a bog in his attempt to flee. Ordered to explain himself before he is rescued, he admits that Angela was fed to something living in Lawrence's house. Geoffery returns to the estate and confronts Lawrence, who admits that the ghoul is his own son; the man has been a cannibal ever since his conversion, and Ayah is another cult adherent who came from India to prepare his food. The agonized Lawrence has tended to and protected his son because he promised his wife he would do so. Geoffery barges into the attic and confronts the ghoul, who kills him. Meanwhile Tom sneaks into the room where Daphne is imprisoned and again tries to assault her. He is interrupted and killed by the ghoul, who has gotten out of control. The creature rounds on Angela, but Lawrence enters with a pistol and fatally wounds it. Daphne runs screaming from the house. Dr. Lawrence, his heart broken by what has happened, goes to his study and shoots himself through the head.
