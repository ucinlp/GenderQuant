Zach Shepard, an executive at a Los Angeles bank, gets a new job in Oregon, running one. What he doesn't realize is that his new place of business is a bank, all right -- a sperm bank. After a lot of initial confusion, Zach and his nurse, Grace Murdock, deal with a shortage of donations by holding a contest with a $100,000 prize. Citizens abstain from sex to save themselves for bank "deposits," while a local brothel protests the sperm bank for ruining its business. Zach is assisted in assorted ways by Newton, an escaped mental patient who lives with his mother, and before his work is done, Zach and Grace are ready to open up a joint account.
