One of the captured knights swears revenge on the village. The villagers  burn the knights eyes out with torches before burning them to death. The film flashes ahead to the present where the village prepares for a festival celebrating the 500 year anniversary of the defeat of the Templars. The village idiot, Murdo, watches the preparations until being attacked and stoned by a pack of children. The children are run off by Moncha and Juan, romantically involved locals. Back in the town square, firework technician and former military captain, Jack Marlowe, meets the mayor, Duncan, his assistant, Dacosta, and his fiancee/ secretary, Vivian. It is revealed that Jack and Vivian have personal history, establishing a tension between the four characters. Jack and Vivian take a walk, where she reveals that she purposely hired Jack to rekindle their romance. Their walk takes them to the abbey graveyard where the Templars are buried. Their romantic interlude is interrupted by peeping Murdo, who proceeds to warn them of the Templars’ impending return. After Jack and Vivian depart, Murdo murders a young townswoman that he has kidnapped as a blood sacrifice. As the festival is in full swing the Templars, awakened by Murdo’s sacrifice, rise. At the festival Jack convinces Vivian to leave with him. Their interactions raise the ire of Duncan and Dacosta, who are a keeping a close eye on the pair. Back at the graveyard, the Templars ride down Murdo  and head toward town. On their way, they come across Moncha’s house where she is in the midst of a sexual rendezvous with Juan. Juan is killed but Moncha escapes on an undead Templar horse. She stops for help at the rail station, where she persuades Mr. Prades, the rail master, of the danger by revealing her zombie horse. She runs off, as Mr. Prades tries to call the mayor. While the phone rings in his office, the mayor dispatches Dacosta and his henchmen to assault Jack. The beating is finally interrupted when the call from the station agent gets through. The mayor is skeptical believes the agent to be drunk. He sends Dacosta to the station to take over. The Templars arrive at the station and kill Mr. Prades. Meanwhile, Jack and Vivian leave in Jack’s car. They encounter the traumatized Moncha in the middle of the road and bring her back to town. Dacosta and another of Duncan’s goons, Beirao, encounter the knights as they approach the train station. They hurry back to the village and warn the mayor of the oncoming horde. They mayor calls the governor to request help, but his pleas fall on deaf ears as the governor assumes Duncan to be drunk and reprimands him. The governor is the third person  to ignore warnings of the coming Templars, assuming the messenger to be drunk. The knights descend on the village and the festival turns into a massacre. Jack organizes Decastro and some of the villagers into a defense force, as Duncan scrambles to gather his valuables and then looks on from the balcony. Eventually Jack and Decastro clear an escape for most of the villagers. Jack, Vivian, Decastro, Monica and Duncan are all left behind. They try to get away in Jack’s car but are overwhelmed by zombies and escape into the church, where two of Duncan’s underlings, Beirao and Amalia, are holed up with their daughter. Once inside the church, the group finds Murdo hiding out. The survivors begin fortifying the church against the undead siege, but before long, unity begins to erode. After failing once again to convince the governor of their plight, Duncan persuades Beirao to make a break for the car. He is killed in the attempt. Meanwhile, Murdo persuades Moncha to come with him into the tunnels beneath the church to escape. After Beirao’s failed attempt, Duncan tries to escape using Beirao and Amalia’s young daughter as bait. He is killed and the child is left in grave peril among the Templars. Jack and Amalia manage to save her, with Amalia sacrificing her own life in the process. Down in the tunnels, Murdo is decapitated by the knights as he climbs out to the surface and Moncha is subsequently pulled by her head through the opening and killed. Back in the church, Dacosta catches Vivian alone. Resigned to a grim fate, he attempts to rape her before the Templars kill him. Jack rescues Vivian, and Dacosta is impaled on a spear in the ensuing scuffle. As the night wears on, Jack and Vivian decide to chance escaping. They convince Amalia’s daughter that the zombies and her mother’s death were both part of a nightmare and then blindfold her as they attempt to silently creep through the square full of blind d knights. As they slip past the monsters, the little girl peeks out of her blindfold and screams as she sees the zombies surrounding them. However, the Templars make no move, and then crumple to the ground in the breaking morning light. Jack, Vivian and the child walk away from the village as the credits roll.
