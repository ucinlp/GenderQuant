A former cop, played by James Brolin, aligns with a street smart young clerk from the New York City dog pound  on a harrowing search for his daughter who is kidnapped by a psychopath  after being mistaken for a wealthy man's daughter. His search is met with obstacles as he runs afoul of the police in his pursuit, including a former corrupt colleague bent on revenge against him. Meanwhile, the kidnapper is just as prepared to kill anybody, including his young hostage, unless his colossal ransom demands are met.
