Vertov starts by showing us, with intertitles in giant Cyrillic characters, what he sees  about the capitalist West with its foxtrot and nigger minstrels, and then switches his attention to the audience  and then the individual viewer . In one self-reflexive moment, Vertov even shows cinema-goers watching an earlier piece of the film . He takes us on a tour of the vital importance of agricultural production, which generates export revenue  so that Russia can buy machines to build more machines . This gives him the pretext to take us on a Cook’s tour of the extremities of the Soviet Union: we see the icebreaker Lenin  delivering new dogs to the Samoyeds on Novaya Zemlya, and their being invited on board to listen to a gramophone recording of the great man himself. We go to Bukhara where one of the mosques is looking very dingy and crumbled, and to Leningrad where the trams run down the middle of broad empty boulevard as a horse-drawn carriage turns out. We see a Kirghiz with a giant eagle perched on his arm, a bear encircled by yapping dogs, a fox caught in a trap and another one that is a child’s pet, guillemots, gulls, a man shooting a sable in the top of a pine tree, a pine marten, sheep being dragged into the sea for a wash and other sheep being obliged to jump in to a stream for the same purpose - the intertitles are surreal: (“You – whether you are washing your sheep in the sea  or whether you are washing your sheep in the river …”, We see trappers bringing their furs to the Госторг  trading post in exchange for manufactured goods, everyone contributing to the national economy. Ironically, the furs are destined for the Leipzig fair . In an amazing stop-frame sequence, rows of oranges align themselves in a packing box, wadges of packing material shuffle along and jump on top of them, and then the lids close . We see coke being quenched also, as well as electricity pylons and insulators, and the village electricity co-op. We see sturgeon being hoiked out of tanks to make caviar. We see barrels of butter – 'it is yours!' We see wheat being threshed, linen being spun and cotton being ginned. We see the country being modernised, although there are still some people who trust in Mohammed  or Christ  or Buddha  and we are shown a Siberian shaman looking remarkably like a North American Indian, and even a reindeer being slaughtered  as a sacrifice. We see crowds of women in full-face veils, but also a modernising country as a woman lifts her veil. And we see some tundra-dwellers eating raw reindeer meat. It’s a fantastic travelogue and anthropological document. Lenin’s mausoleum is his alone at this time . The moral: everyone produces and is building socialism. It starts with slavery and ends with developing countries joining the socialist revolution.
