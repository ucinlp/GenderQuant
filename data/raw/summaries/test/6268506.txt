Diyari, a Kurdish/American returns to his hometown of Halabja, to build an orphanage five years after the chemical bombing. There, he meets Jiyan and Sherko, orphan survivors of the attack. During his stay in the town, Diyari brings a short lived spark of hope and happiness to the children's lives, and as he leaves, the orphans go back to their lonely lives. Diyari leaves tearful Jiyan at the place where they met first: on a swing under a lonely tree on a small hill.
