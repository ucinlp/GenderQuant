When she turns 18, unhappy Lidda Daniels leaves Southern California to look for Charlie, her father, a professional gambler who abandoned her years before. On her way to Vegas, she picks up Colonel, a video store clerk whom she finds attractive even though they've never spoken. This film is most notable for its first poker scene in which James Caan and Vincent Kartheiser face off against each other. The drama is lessened because one of the players is playing Texas hold 'em, while the other appears to be playing five card draw, in the same game.
