Harry Palmer heads a private investigation business based in Moscow. His associates are Nikolai "Nick" Petrov , ex-CIA agent Craig , and ex-KGB Colonel Gradsky . They take on the job of finding 1000 grams of weapons-grade plutonium stolen from the Russian government, though they do not know the identity of their client. This leads Harry back to Saint Petersburg, where  he managed to make enemies of both of the leading rival gangsters, Alex  and Yuri . Nonetheless, suspecting that Alex is involved, Harry talks Yuri into helping him. As a complication, Nick's ballerina girlfriend Tatiana  is kidnapped by a gang working for Alex into order to pressure her father, the head curator of the Hermitage Museum, into helping steal valuable artwork for crooked art dealer Dr. Vestry . Also in the mix is reporter Brandy , who turns out also to be working for Alex. Nick is captured when he goes looking for Tatiana, but manages to escape in time to assist Harry, with Yuri's help, foil both schemes.
