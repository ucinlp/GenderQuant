Mermaids sing up to us about mermaids and fishes at play; they and some other sea creatures dance to it. Buddy as a mermaid tag with Cookie as a mermaid, but he gets too rough and turns her off. Buddy looks inside a shipwreck and drags Cookie to it; she busies herself playing with the jewelry in a treasure chest. Meanwhile, Buddy finds some props in another truck and does an imitation of Charles Chaplin. Cookie finds a piano and plays the title song. The noise draws an octopus, who grabs her and swims off, with Buddy in pursuit. The octopus drops Cookie to fight Buddy, and does do so with some success until Buddy lures it into a pipe and ties the tentacles to a flange, then starts bashing the octopus with a battering ram. Cookie kisses Buddy; he blushes, then gets hit by the battering ram into her arms.
