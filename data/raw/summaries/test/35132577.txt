The film begins as Luke enjoys a spring day at the Seattle Center and tries via his cell phone to convince multiple friends join him on his first trip to Tacoma. None of them are interested, including some who refuse due to the perceived dangerous nature of the city. Luke decides to take a trip on his own and as he takes an on-ramp on to Interstate 5, the namesake of the movie, a sign for “South 5” appears. The first stop for Luke is the Point Defiance Zoo. As he starts to enjoy his experience, he is suddenly hit in the face by a banana, and then immediately attacked by a gorilla. A zookeeper apologizes, offering to show the man the polar bears. Luke quickly refuses and heads for downtown Tacoma. Upon strolling through downtown, Luke is tripped and attacked by a mysterious figure wearing a Shriner’s Cap and then bitten on his leg by a small masked boy wearing a cape. He escapes the two aggressors by jumping on to Tacoma’s light rail train, and again begins to relax, taking in the sights. Luke again starts to enjoy Tacoma, taking a leisurely walk across the internationally recognized Chihuly Bridge of Glass, when he is suddenly chased by a man wearing an eye patch, who bears a resemblance to legendary Studio Glass pioneer Dale Chihuly . As Luke is chased through Tacoma, the gorilla, zookeeper, Shriner and boy, all join in. Luke, who only wanted to experience Tacoma for the first time, exclaims he is going back to Seattle and speeds away in his car. As the film ends, the Shriner calls The Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce and informs a shadowy figure that the team’s mission has been accomplished. The team congratulates itself on frightening the man away from enjoying Tacoma and begins to prepare for a family from Queen Anne  that is coming to Tacoma to look for a home.
