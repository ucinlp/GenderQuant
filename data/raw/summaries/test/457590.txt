After the end of World War I, due to the Treaty of Versailles, an old German mine is split in two because of the new border, and the mine is closed off at the border, including an underground mine. The economic downturn and employment situation adds to tension between the two countries as German workers seek employment with the French but are turned away. In the French part of the mine a fire breaks out and they try to contain the fire by building brick walls. The Germans continue to work on their side. Nonetheless the fire gets out of control, causing an explosion that traps many French miners. In response, Wittkopp ([[Ernst Busch  appeals to his bosses to send a rescue team. As they ride out of town to help, the leader of the German rescue effort explains to his wife that the French are men with women and children and he would hope that they would come to his aid in similar circumstances. Meanwhile, a trio of German miners breaks through a set of steel bars that mark the 1919 border. On the French side, an old retired miner  sneaks into the shaft hoping to rescue his young grandson . The miners forget their nationalities and past troubles and try to build a new camaraderie on the foundation of human solidarity. The Germans successfully rescue the French miners, not without some interesting difficulties. After all the survivors are rescued, there's a big party with speeches about friendship between the French and Germans. The film shows a new idealistic unity between the miners, despite the political and nationalistic obstacles that still remain. At the end, ironically, French officials rebuild the mining gate, and return to the status quo ante.
