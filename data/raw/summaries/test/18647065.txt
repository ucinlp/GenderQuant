The Pink Panther appears on a stage, advertising his "Pink Punch" drink via a series of placards with, of course, pink lettering. On the placard with the product name, the dot above the "i" in "Pink" is a six-pointed asterisk. However, the moment he displays it, the asterisk turns green and the audience begins laughing. The Panther tries various stratagems  to change the asterisk back to pink, but it stubbornly changes back to green, turns the placard green, then jumps off the placard and begins taunting him, squirting green ink all over him. When he tries to destroy it, he is confronted with an extremely large, threatening green five-pointed asterisk, evidently the small one's parent or guardian. This surreal situation continues in the Panther's laboratory where he is mixing up more Pink Punch. The green asterisk appears with a beach umbrella and towel, and dives into the basin, turning the punch green. The Panther pulls the plug to send the asterisk down the drain, but the large asterisk appears again and forces him to fish the small asterisk out with a plunger. When the Panther flies his small prop plane trailing an advertising banner, the asterisk shows up in midair and falls in love with the airplane's  propellor, proposing  that they have a family , and the propellor pops off the airplane and joins the asterisk, leaving the hapless Panther plummeting to the ground. Covered in bandages, the Panther limps back to the stage area and grimly puts up more placards advertising "Drink Green Punch", this time in all-green lettering with the asterisk proudly dotting the "i" of "Drink". Drinking the punch turns the Panther green. As he turns away, the asterisk turns itself pink.
