Deerfield's investigation is aided by a police detective , who becomes personally involved in the case. They find Mike's body, mutilated and burned. Military officials initially attempt to block the police investigation; they suggest Mike's death was due to drug-related violence. His platoon mates who last saw him lie to Deerfield and the police. Deerfield, a former military police officer , tells the police that although he suspects the soldiers are lying about something, he believes they could not have killed their comrade. It turns out that Deerfield is wrong. The soldiers had killed and dismembered Mike after a seemingly insignificant quarrel. The soldier who confesses to Deerfield and the police seems emotionally detached from his words and actions, apparently to suggest he suffers post-traumatic stress disorder from events of the war.
