A down on his luck, former Green Beret captain , freshly discharged from the Vietnam War, drifts into Drury, Kansas. There he finds a derelict merry-go-round that he decides to restore. "The symbolism of a man wanting to build something joyful after being part of the carnage and destruction of war," surmised film critic, Charles Champlin. Both men supply employment to the veteran as well as parts and tools for his endeavor. Another helpful character is a young local girl, who watches the reconstruction efforts from afar, and scampers off when she is seen. The girl, played by Carradine's real life domestic partner, Barbara Hershey, provides a tool box and some food. Detractors of the veteran's efforts include a band of local teenagers, one of whom is played by John Blyth Barrymore, a personal friend of Carradine's and a frequent guest star on Kung Fu.{{cite news}} When the town's ruffians vandalize the half-restored carousel, the captain redoubles his efforts. By this time he has found, to his displeasure, that Mike's favorite pastime is to officiate the weekly cock fights, and the two have a falling out. Mike refuses to make good on a promise of a much needed part for the carousel, unless the soldier agrees to fight a dog. The veteran reluctantly agrees to the fight during which he kills the dog. After installing the last piece that completes the carousel's restoration, he lays the dog's body inside it, starts it up and walks away, while the townspeople look on.
