The film is set in Igloolik  in the Eastern Arctic wilderness at the dawn of the first millennium.http://atanarjuat.com/legend/legend_film.php  The wind is blowing over a bleak snowy landscape while a man tries to herd away some marauding dogs. We hear the voice  of an old man singing a childish song. Inside a stone house a strange shaman by the name of Tungajuaq, who comes from up north, is singing playfully to the gathered community and camp leader Kumaglak. But among the spectators there are some mistrustful faces. Flash forward to another day. Qulitalik is bidding goodbye to his sister Panikpak, wife of Kumaglak, promising to come if she calls for help in her heart. She gives him her husband's rabbit's foot for spiritual power. Qulitalik tells his sister, "Tulimaq is the one they'll go after now." It seems that Qulitalik is leaving to escape a threat, and the hope is that one day he will return to help. As Panikpak watches him leave, we hear a voice-over from a woman : "We never knew what he was or why it happened. Evil came to us like Death. It just happened and we had to live with it." Flash back to the original scene in the stone house. The visitor and the camp leader Kumaglak are in a "friendly" spiritual duel involving binding in leather thongs. But Panikpak is startled when the stone lamp in front of her breaks in half, and, to the horror of those present, Kumaglak falls over dead. The visitor removes the leader's walrus-tooth necklace from Kumaglak's body, and, passing by Tulimaq, he puts the necklace around the neck of Sauri, the son of the murdered leader Kumaglak, saying, "Be careful what you wish for" . Tulimaq leaves, shouting at Sauri "You helped him murder your own father!" Time passes; the shaman's curse has poisoned the camp. Tulimaq, now the local laughing stock, is having trouble feeding his family because of "bad luck" hunting. But Panikpak secretly brings meat for Tulimaq's children, Amaqjuaq and Atanarjuat, hoping that one day they will grow strong and be able to make things right.  Flash forward a couple of decades. Tulimaq's sons - Amaqjuaq and Atanarjuat are now young men, excellent hunters, and they are a thorn in the side of the camp leader Sauri and his son Oki. One day, out on the ice, Oki arrives with his pals to "borrow" the brothers' dogs and sled. But Atanarjuat, the fast runner, chases them down, and Amaqjuaq, the strong one, throws the gang off the sled. Later, during a game of "wolf tag" at camp, Atanarjuat chases the beautiful Atuat, for whom he has an obvious liking, provoking jealous anger from Oki, who was betrothed to Atuat when they were children. To complicate matters further, Oki's sister Puja also openly shows her tender feelings for Atanarjuat. The scene is set for a duel. Even Oki's grandmother Panikpak does not want Atuat to marry Oki, because, she says, Oki is a cruel man, just like his father Sauri has been since the evil shaman's visit.  In a large igloo they are singing and playing games of strength as a prelude to a feast. Atanarjuat and Oki warm up for a head-punching duel by singing mocking songs at each other. As the duel begins, Oki is startled with a vision of the evil shaman, and Atanarjuat is protected by a prayer by Panikpak to her dead husband. Atanarjuat ends up knocking Oki into helpless spasms, thus winning the right to marry Atuat.  Some time later, Atanarjuat is a happy husband to the pregnant Atuat. Tulimaq tells Atanarjuat that he should leave to hunt caribou, and an elder suggests that Atanarjuat stop at Sauri's camp, joking about the women that he will find there. On his trip Atanarjuat does stop at Sauri's camp, where Oki and Sauri suggest that he should take Puja to help with the hunt. Atanarjuat naively allows himself to be persuaded. At a waterfront camp, Atanarjuat and Puja pass the evening singing and flirting and eventually end up in the tent making love. Time passes; it is summer. Atanarjuat is now in an unhappy marriage with two wives, Atuat and Puja, and has a young son by Atuat. Atuat and Amaqjuaq's wife Uluriaq complain that Puja is not helping with the daily work. Later, in the tent, under the communal fur shared by the family, Puja and her brother in law Amaqjuaq softly slide together and begin to make love. Uluriaq wakes up and screams, and Atanarjuat cuffs Puja on the head. Puja flees to Sauri's camp and arrives there black-eyed, crying that Atanarjuat tried to kill her for no reason. Oki vows revenge.  Atuat and Uluriaq look up to see Puja returning to their camp, crying remorsefully. They are suspicious, but accept her apology. At Puja's suggestion, Atuat and Uluriaq leave to pick eggs, while Atanarjuat and Amaqjuaq retire to the tent to sleep. Alone outside the tent, Puja places a boot against the tent to indicate who is sleeping on that side. She leaves to join the other women as Oki and his gang appear over the hilltop. From inside the tent we hear Amaqjuaq admit to his brother that he has done him wrong — the last words he will ever speak. Oki and his two henchmen sneak up and plunge their spears through the tent wall. Oki's spear comes out stained with the blood of Amaqjuaq. But Oki is startled and distracted at a vision of his grandfather Kumaglak shouting angrily "Atanarjuat's brother is coming after you!". At that instant, Atanarjuat, naked, barefoot, and unharmed, bursts out of the tent and runs off across the ice.  Oki and his two sidekicks give chase on foot, but Atanarjuat, the fast runner, keeps well ahead of them, running steadily for miles barefoot on the ice. Oki knows there is an open crack in the ice which will stop Atanarjuat. But as Atanarjuat runs he sees a vision of an old man calling to him. Atanarjuat follows the vision and gains the power to make a soaring leap over the open crack. Oki is forced to turn back to get his dog sled. An old man is picking eggs and looking around uneasily. It is the man whose spirit appeared to Atanarjuat on the ice. He returns to his wife and adopted daughter with more eggs than they could possibly eat themselves. Atanarjuat, freezing cold and with feet raw and bloody, finally collapses on the ice. He wakes up wrapped in furs with the old man and his family staring down at him. Atanarjuat tells them he is being chased, and the daughter spots a sled team approaching. The family hide Atanarjuat under some dry seaweed. Oki and his brothers arrive, and in spite of Oki's threats and questions, the family profess to have seen no one. Oki urinates on the seaweed under which Atanarjuat is hiding. The family feeds their visitors eggs until they are stuffed. After the meal Oki tells the old man that he knows he is Qulitalik, Oki's great uncle, who left Igloolik many years ago  and that they had all thought he had died. Oki eventually leaves in the hope of finding Atanarjuat's body on the ice.  Back at Igloolik, Oki is angry because Sauri refuses to let him have Atuat. One day, while Atuat is spending time alone, Oki's henchmen grab her and pin her down while Oki rapes her. Later, Panikpak comes to Atuat to offer her comfort. Winter has arrived again, and the ice is freezing over. Atanarjuat, having healed with help from his rescuers, is impatient to return to Igloolik. He is not scared of Oki, but the evil spirit behind Oki. "Only you know when you are ready", Qulitalik tells him — spiritual healing is as important as the physical. The men of Igloolik are out on the ice hunting seals. Oki approaches Sauri and stabs him in the stomach with the words "Get out of my way, Atuat's mine now." Oki tells the others that Sauri tripped and stabbed himself, and they bring the body of Sauri back to Igloolik on a sled. Amidst the mourning and crying, the leader's walrus-tooth necklace is removed from Sauri's body and placed around Oki's neck: Oki is now the camp leader. He later tells Atuat that he wants nothing to do with her, and as time passes he provides her with no food or care. She becomes almost desperate enough to beg him for help. In her heart, Panikpak calls out to her brother Qulitalik  to summon him supernaturally, as they agreed so long ago.  Sensing his sister's call, Qulitalik tells his family that they will all go to Igloolik with Atanarjuat. Outside, Qulitalik performs a magic ritual using rabbit's feet, and back at Igloolik Oki sees a rabbit in the snow that he is able to catch with his bare hands. When he eats the rabbit meat he falls under a happy spell that makes him forget all his grievances. Having made the long sled journey across the ice, Atanarjuat, Qulitalik, and the family approach Igloolik. Atuat runs out and is joyfully reunited with her husband. Puja runs out too, but Atanarjuat humiliates her by cutting open her jacket and turns her away. Oki, still under the spell, does not defend Puja, but instead suggests that they prepare food for the visitors. Atanarjuat builds an igloo with smooth ice floor and invites Oki and his pals to an early start to the feast. They begin eating and talking as old friends. Then Atanarjuat steps out for a moment and returns with a caribou antler club in his hand and caribou antler spikes attached to his feet. He attacks while his enemies slide helplessly on the ice. Pinning Oki down, Atanarjuat smashes the club into the ice beside Oki's head and declares that the killing will stop now. Emerging from the igloo victorious, Atanarjuat finds the community gathered outside. Qulitalik takes the walrus tooth necklace off Oki's neck and gives it to Panikpak to take care of until the evening, when they will meet to finally confront the evil that has been with them for so long.  With the community gathered that evening, Qulitalik chews on a walrus-skin bag to call forth the spirits. The evil shaman Tungajuaq appears, blowing and grunting with the eerie echo of a polar bear. The others recoil in fear, but Qulitalik places a carved pair of tusks in his mouth and confronts Tungajuaq with the powerful spirit of the walrus. Panikpak joins him, shaking the walrus tooth necklace. Feeling the force of their spiritual onslaught, the shaman backs up. Qulitalik throws some magic soil into the shaman's face, and the evil shaman screams and disappears into thin air. Panikpak speaks to the gathered group in the stone house. It is time for forgiveness, she says, and to rid the community of the evil that has plagued them for so many years. Oki and Puja and their friends are forgiven for their evil deeds, she says, but they must leave Igloolik immediately and never return. As Puja cries in grief the troublemakers all leave, with one final furious and agonised look from Oki. Joy sweeps the gathered community. Then the voice of the old leader of the camp, Kumaglak, is heard coming from his namesake Kumaglak, the little son of Atanarjuat and Atuat. Old Kumaglak asks his wife Panikpak to sing his old song, which she does, as everyone joins in.
