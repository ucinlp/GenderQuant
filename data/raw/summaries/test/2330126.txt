 The film begins with Turaga Vakama  describing a land that existed before Mata Nui called Metru Nui. The residents of the great city believed that the warriors known as the Toa would protect them, but eventually they were all defeated, save for one named "Lhikan". Lhikan travels throughout the entire city, giving Toa stones to six Matoran: Whenua, Nuju, Matau, Onewa, Nokama, and Vakama. After giving the last stone to Vakama, Lhikan is captured by two Dark Hunters called Nidhiki  and Krekka. Vakama later meets the other Matoran at the Great Temple in Ga-Metru; there, they are transformed into six new Toa. After Vakama has a vision, they all set out to recover the six Great Disks hidden throughout Metru Nui, believing that it would prove to Turaga Dume  that they are worthy Toa. Upon retrieving the disks , the Toa bring the disks to the Coliseum. However, Dume issues that "small gifts" won't confirm them as Toa. He then tests them by starting a sea of rising metal in the Coliseum. When the six fail to cross it, and Dume denounces them as "imposters", he unleashes the Vahki  upon them. In the process, Onewa, Nuju, and Whenua are sucked into a massive vortex and imprisoned while Vakama and the others escape the Coliseum by leaping into a chute system. However, the Dark Hunters follow them and manage to get the flow of the chute reversed. The Toa escape, but are left dangling from a dangerous height. While swinging to a tower, Matau falls, but is saved when he discovers that his blades can grant him flight. When the Toa reach the ground, Vakama discovers that the Great Disks can be fused together. He then spots Lhikanâ€™s "spirit star" soaring overhead; as long as it burns in the night sky, it means that Lhikan is still alive. They hitched a ride on a Vahki transport to follow the star. When they arrived in Po-Metru, they encountered the Dark Hunters once more. Just when a battle is about to ensue, a herd of beasts called Kikanalo stampeded through canyons. As the Toa were fleeing, Nokama discovered that her mask allowed her to speak and understand the language of the Kikanalo. After stopping the stampede, she spoke to the leader of the herd and learned that Lhikan was taken to the Canyon of Unending Whispers. They were then taken to a large canyon guarded by Vahki. They managed to bypass the Vahki and the Dark Hunters with the help of the Kikanalo and Matau's newly discovered mask power of illusion. While the previous events occurred, Onewa and Whenua were unsuccessfully trying to break out of prison. They then met a Turaga. He explained that mask powers are needed to escape, and how they could be found. He then had the Toa perform seemingly pointless tasks. Eventually, Onewa and Whenua got into a fight in which Onewa discovered that his mask power was mind-control. Nuju then discovered his mask power, Telekinesis, and created a way out. Whenua found his mask power, night-vision, and provided illumination in the tunnel with his mask. They were then reunited with the other three Toa. When they debated where Lhikan was, the Turaga removed his helmet and revealed that he was Lhikan. Vakama finds a small canister holding Dume and learned that the Dume from before was an impostor. A squadron of Vahki suddenly attacked and the group fled on a spare transport. Meanwhile, "Dume" had summoned the Matoran to the Coliseum to be placed in the spheres. By the time the Toa arrived, it was too late; all the Matoran were now asleep. The false Dume then removed his mask and revealed himself to be Makuta Teridax. He plunged the Great Spirit Mata Nui into slumber and began absorbing energy from the city. He then absorbed Nivawk, Krekka, and Nidhiki, thus killing them. Whenua located the Matoran , who were underneath the Coliseum and stored in canisters. After surveying them, they realized that only a few of the Matoran can been carried on the transport and the rest would have to wait. They gathered as many of the spheres as possible, and began their journey out. Along the way, Vakama begins carving the Mask of Time from the disk when all visions he had previously seen reappeared and he came to a revelation: Teridax wanted control of time. To save the Matoran, the Toa must "follow the light". But as they neared, Teridax, now an immense winged being, attacked. Vakama attempted to use the Mask of Time when he confronted the Makuta, but Teridax then launched an attack. Because the Mask of Time only slowed time, Vakama could not avoid it. Just then, Lhikan leaped in and took the blow. The Mask of Time was knocked off of Vakama, and Teridax flew after it. As Lhikan lay dying, he explained to Vakama the Toa's duty to the Matoran. He then gave Vakama his mask and died. Anguished, Vakama discovered his mask power: invisibility. Just as Teridax was about to use the Mask of Time, Vakama knocked it away, and the mask fell into the sea. Teridax, enraged, attempts to kill Vakama. After a deadly battle, Vakama managed to trick Teridax into grabbing a towering boulder which slammed him into a wall. The Toa gathered and, combining their powers, sealed Teridax in a protodermis prison. The Toa continued towards the light and arrived on the island of Mata Nui. When all the Matoran Spheres were placed on the beach of Mata Nui, the Toa discharged energy into the spheres, becoming Turaga in the process, and awakened the Matoran. One of the Matoran, Takua, led Vakama to a Matoran whose mask was shattered. Vakama gave this Matoran, Jaller, Lhikan's mask and its shape changed to become his. The film then ends with the other Matoran cheering while the symbol of the Three Virtues  appeared in the sky.
