Lucky Delon is a prizefighter who is approached by a gangster, BMF, to throw his next fight. Refusing to be intimidated, Lucky knocks his opponent out and skips town. There is no escape for Lucky, however, when the gangster's henchman catches up with him. Unless he makes amends by doing a hit, he is dead. Faced with no choice, Lucky goes to a bar, where he meets Harvey "The Hitman" Roach, a professional killer who instructs Lucky in the art of being a hitman. But just as Lucky is getting used to having a hitman for a mentor, the BMF springs a new trap that results in a violent and bloody showdown.
