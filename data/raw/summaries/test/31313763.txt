The film is set in Hawaii and features fire-twirling women who participate in rituals to appease the awoken monster. The hunters become the prey when illegal dynamite fishing prematurely ends the hibernation of a mythological carnivorous lizard-man known as Akua which lives in the lake. The owner of the local resort, whose patrons have become the appetizers on this predator's menu, and a woman herpetologist join forces with the sheriff to save the tourists from succumbing to the feasting of the beast.
