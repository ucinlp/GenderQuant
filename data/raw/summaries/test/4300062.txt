In this movie, Lina and Gourry travel to the town of Acassi, known for its tasty octopus. However, the octopus meat is cursed, causing the person who eats it to only be able to speak takogo . Sorcerers and sorceresses cursed by this also cannot cast spells, since the spells have to be spoken in a common language in order for them to work. Gourry just happens to eat one of the cursed octopuses , which causes him to speak in takogo. This often creates awkward situations during the film . But soon, everyone in town starts to speak takogo , despite the fact that they haven't eaten any octopus. Xellos is also there, seeming to know some details about what is going on but isn't divulging anything. It soon becomes evident that the octopuses plan to use the accumulated anger from the villagers of Acassi to release a demon that was sealed many years before. Lina and her friends have to stop these plans before they come to fruition. However, it becomes complicated when Lina is infected with the takogo affliction, which negates much of her magic, including the Dragon Slave, her signature move.
