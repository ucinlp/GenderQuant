A dam in a small town in midwest America  is filling up with water due to heavy rains. The disgraced architect of the dam building project comes back to town to reunite with his estranged family, however he is rejected, with his wife claiming that he came back purely to see the dam. The architect then visits the dam and reveals that the project manager cut corners in order to take money himself and framed the architect to hide his own corruption. The dam's resident engineer, Frank, the architect's son, Garth and the man himself set out to relieve the growing pressure on the dam wall, however the pressure release does not work, as corner cutting had led to this portion not being completed. Through flooding the warehouse district, Frank allows the townspeople enough time to escape, sacrificing himself in the process. Garth and his father than become trapped within the dam as the structure begins to buckle, but Garth's mother rescues them at the last minute and they make a dramatic escape from the wall of water as the dam collapses, taking refuge on top of 2 story car park. The final scene is one of reflection, on man's inherit lust for power. The film fades to black as Garth directs a question at the audience, asking them what they would have done had they'd been project manager.
