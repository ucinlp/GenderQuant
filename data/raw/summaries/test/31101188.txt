Newborn baby Annie is HIV positive and has been left in the clinic by her drug addicted mother. To prevent being deported to a home where she will wait to die, nurse Susan decides to take care of Annie at her own home. Two years later she plans to adopt the child but suddenly Annie's mother reappears and demands her back. Under the law, Susan, as just the foster-mother, has no claim to the child.
