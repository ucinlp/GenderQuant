The nameless detective, interested in Bluebeard's case, drives to question him, at the same time making a phone call to his wife. His overly jealous wife tries to persuade him to return immediately, as she suspects him in infidelity. But the detective is fascinated with the story of Bluebeard, who suddenly appears in front of him. Bluebeard says he was sincerely looking for a happy married life. He "was living alone, all alone in the world" and "wandered around the castle, waiting for [his] brides". Bluebeard wished to be "a husband and a father" and to have, like other people, "family, love and duty". However, his first wife, Marianna, was a terrible fashion-monger, who tormented Bluebeard with recent fashion trends. She cut his beard, completely renovated the interior of the castle and didn't pay Bluebeard any attention, calling him old-fashioned. In the end, exasperated Bluebeard treaded on the tail of her personal dragon and Marianna was burned alive. His blue beard grows again. The second wife, Lilianna, was a health worker. She noted that Bluebeard suffered from "total thinness" and that he treated himself with criminal negligence: "You're on the brink of the grave, but I'll take your case." Lilianna made her husband do gymnastics, yoga, prohibited drinking wine, eating meat and etc. Extremely exhausted Bluebeard endured it due to his love for her, but finally poisoned her with an Amanita . The third wife, Vivianna, was very beautiful, sociable and cheery. Unlike previous wives, she had butterfly wings. At first Bluebeard and his wife happily feasted, surrounded by friends and neighbors of the duke. Vivianna, singing "love has no boundaries", flew around the castle: "If it is possible to embrace all living creatures, I am ready to embrace them all". One day Bluebeard went hunting and returned only to find Vivianna in bed with one of his own friends. After short mêlée combat Bluebeard was killed by a stab in the back. Detective writes down the story. On the way home he calls his wife to tell her about a successfully completed investigation. His paranoiac wife doesn't believe him and starts a quarell, accusing her husband of infidelity and promising him divorce. The detective spitefully answers "I'll be home in a moment, my dear", and a blue beard grows on his face.
