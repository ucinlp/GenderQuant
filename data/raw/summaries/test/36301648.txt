While travelling through Texas  five friends become lost, with their van running low on gas. When one of the group, Christine, goes out to urinate, two of the others pass the time waiting for her to come back by having sex in the back of the vehicle. Shortly after Christine returns, the quintet pick up a hitchhiker in the hope that he can give them directions, but once inside the van the man attacks them with a knife, stabbing two members of the group to death while the others flee and become separated. Vanessa reaches a farmhouse, but while searching for aid she is captured by Leatherface, who ties her to a chair, and gags her. Vanessa's boyfriend and Christine reach the same farmhouse moments later, and are allowed in by the inhabitants, a pair of deranged sisters, one of whom lures Vanessa's boyfriend into another room. While those two have sex, Christine has a threesome with the remaining sister, Daisy, and the woman's mute brother, Robbie, believing it to be the only way the siblings will offer them any aid. When Vanessa's boyfriend climaxes, the sister hacks one of his arms off with a hatchet, gnaws on the severed limb, and taunts him as he dies. As that occurs, Christine passes out on the family's couch, being awakened hours later by Leatherface, who drags her outside. Christine is pummeled and "raped to death" with a gasoline-powered vibrator by Leatherface, who afterward licks the blood off the weapon with Daisy. The next day, a sister forces Vanessa to watch as she has sex with Robbie. When the two finish, they and their siblings  and grandfather eat a butchered body in front of Vanessa, occasionally pelting her with viscera. As his family eats, Leatherface takes Vanessa away, intending to kill her with the vibrator weapon, but he is caught off guard when Vanessa begins flirting with him. Vanessa has sex with Leatherface, distracting him and allowing her to grab a knife, stab him in the leg, and escape. An unknown amount of time later, the battered Vanessa awakens in a hospital room, where she is interviewed by Detective Mike Roe. As the interview progresses, the detective's questions become disturbing, and he takes nude pictures of Vanessa for "evidentiary purposes" before she falls unconscious. Vanessa wakes up later, being duct taped to the bed by Daisy, who is dressed like a nurse. Detective Roe appears and reveals he is the patriarch of the cannibal family, and that Vanessa never escaped them; the hospital room is one of their properties. Roe pulls a sheet over Vanessa's head, and he and Daisy beat her to death with a wrench.
