Samantha Sherwood, a beautiful aspiring actress has herself committed to a mental institution to do some background research for the role of a woman with unstable sanity in a film called 'Audra' in which her well known director, Jonathon Stryker, leaves her at the mental institution. Once finding out Stryker is letting a new group of girls audition for the role of Audra, she escapes the asylum for revenge. One of the girls who was going to audition, Amanda Teuther, is stabbed to death before she even gets the chance to go to Stryker's mansion for the audition. The next day we are introduced to the five other women auditioning for the part of Audra. The girls consist of Patti, Brooke, Laurian, Tara, and Christie. The remaining five girls left to audition meet Stryker at his mansion along with Samantha who appears at the house without welcome. After a night of the girls getting to know each other Christie is brutally murdered while figure skating by someone in a grotesque hag mask outside of Stryker's house the next morning. Later that day, while the girls are all auditioning, Brooke discovers Christie's decapitated head in a toilet bowl. She tells Stryker what she saw but when they go back to the bathroom where she found Christie's head they find nothing in the toilet. Abusing Brooke's vulnerability, Stryker gets her to reluctantly sleep with him. Meanwhile, Tara and Patti start to wonder what may have caused Brooke to say that Christie was dead which causes Tara to suspect foul play while Laurian is killed while dancing. After having sex Brooke and Stryker are both shot to death, to which Tara discovers the bodies. After trying to escape the isolated location Tara is chased by the hag in a backstage prop shed. After escaping the killer nearly three times, she is killed after being dragged into a ventilation system by the hag. A little later Samantha and Patti have a bottle of champagne and discuss Audra being insane in the kitchen. Samantha tells Patti about how Stryker left her in the aslyum and eventually admits to shooting Stryker and Brooke. After telling Patti this information Patti admits to killing the other girls and stabs Samantha to death. The epilogue consists of Patti performing Audra to other patients in a mental institution.
