Brandon  is a successful and handsome thirty-something advertising executive living and working in New York. Distanced from his sister and seemingly without any close friends, he struggles with a secret sexual addiction. On a subway train he flirts with a woman and she flirts back. She has on both a wedding ring and an engagement ring, and when they exit the train, she disappears into the crowd. His company's computer system has been compromised by a virus; in the cleanup, Brandon's computer hard drive indicates an obsessive amount of surfing extreme porn sites, one of which is probably the source of the virus. Although Brandon, who is driven to masturbate in the bathroom stall at work, is responsible, it is assumed his intern is to blame. Brandon and his married boss David  meet three women at a club. Brandon has sex with one of them, the woman David was pursuing. When Brandon arrives home, he assumes a burglar is in his house, but finds a naked woman taking a shower. It is his sister Sissy . She works as a part-time singer who has a few gigs in the city, she asks to stay with Brandon; he later hears her pleading with her lover on the telephone not to reject her. The next morning, at the subway station, Sissy is balancing herself on the edge of the platform. Brandon rebukes her, and in the brief exchange that follows Sissy persuades her brother to visit her as she performs at a clubâ€”something that he avoided in the past. Later, Brandon is joined by an enthusiastic David as they watch Sissy singing a very sad jazz version of "New York, New York", which makes Brandon emotional. Sissy joins Brandon and David at their table, where David courts her despite Brandon's evident dismay. Sissy accepts David's advances and has sex with him in her brother's bedroom while Brandon, disgusted, leaves his apartment and goes out running. Later that night, Sissy attempts to sleep in his bed with him; enraged, he orders her out of the room. Brandon's co-worker, Marianne , flirts with him at work. On the way to dinner with her, he stops to observe a high-rise hotel, where he sees a couple having sex up against the window. The date becomes awkward as conversation steers on their affective differences: Marianne, who was recently separated, keeps a positive attitude toward commitment, while Brandon dislikes marriage and admits that his relationships have never lasted longer than four months. Brandon and Marianne part ways at the end of the night without kissing, each going home alone. Sissy arrives at Brandon's apartment and accidentally walks in on him masturbating in the bathroom. He physically attacks Sissy, accusing her of spying on him. She then finds his laptop open on a pornography webcam site; the woman on the webcam is familiar with him and assumes Sissy is his girlfriend. Brandon slams the laptop shut. Disturbed and upset, Sissy leaves. Brandon angrily throws out all of his pornographic magazines and his laptop. The next day, at work, he kisses Marianne and then takes her to the same high-rise hotel where he saw the couple having sex. In the bathroom, he snorts a line of cocaine. They attempt to have sex, but Brandon cannot maintain an erection and appears heavily distressed. Marianne leaves, after which Brandon is seen having sex with another woman against the window. He stays in the hotel room and watches the sun set. Brandon is home watching cartoons when Sissy arrives. Knowing that she is emotionally dependent and has probably called David, he tells her that he is disgusted with her and that David won't be seeing her again. He tells her she needs to leave, that he feels trapped by her. She says that they are family and are supposed to help each other, but Brandon accuses her of being nothing but a burden. Brandon then heads out to a bar, where he gropes a woman and blatantly tries to pick her up, making a variety of suggestive and provocative remarks to her. He ends up being beaten up by her boyfriend whom he has deliberately antagonised by making aggressive reference to his fantasies about her. During this sequence of the film, the chronology is not linear: we see Brandon's injury - a wound on his left cheek - before we understand how it has been caused. After he is denied entrance to a nightclub with the words "Not tonight", he notices a gay bar across the street and enters. He walks to the back, where several men are having sex; a man kisses Brandon and then performs fellatio on him. On leaving the bar, he listens to a voicemail message from Sissy telling him how much she needs him, and that they aren't bad people, they've just come from a bad place. He leaves once again to visit an apartment occupied by two prostitutes, where the three have sex. While Brandon is riding the subway on his way home, the passengers are asked to leave the carriage due to an implied suicide further up the tracks. He frantically calls Sissy, but she does not answer, so he rushes home. When he gets there, Sissy, who has a history of cutting herself, is lying on the bathroom floor, having slashed her wrists. She survives and he comforts her in the hospital. After leaving, he collapses and cries in the rain. Some time later, Brandon is seen sitting on a subway train and the same woman from the beginning of the film sits across from him, wearing just an engagement ring this time. He tries to look away, but she keeps staring at him and smiling. She stands up to leave the train and Brandon keeps staring at her as the screen cuts to black.
