Returning home from school one day in 1986, a young Darius Foxx witnesses his mailman father shoot his mother and her lover after walking in on them together. After killing the couple, Darius's father looks directly into his son's eyes, and shoots himself in the mouth. Sixteen years later, Darius moves to the town of Smithfield as the new mailman, cryptically telling anyone who asks that his predecessor is "out of town" for an indeterminate amount of time. Behind his initially cheerful facade, Darius is a psychopath who spends his free time reading and tampering with the mail of people on his route, rewriting letters and smashing packages, among other acts of vandalism. Aiding Darius is a local teenage delinquent named Daniel Everson, who had become disillusioned after discovering his older sister, Beth, and best friend, Jay, are dating, and after being told by Darius that he is adopted. Unbeknownst to Daniel however, Darius is serial killer who murders people who become suspicious of him, such as a gas meter man, and Daniel's girlfriend, Veronica. After the two enact a plan to blackmail the mayor using information on his family's illegal activities they had gleaned from the mail, Darius reveals to Daniel that he is his biological brother, and that he had moved to Smithfield to find and reconnect with him. Shortly after returning to Darius's house, Darius sends Daniel out to get beer, and while he is gone, Darius kills a hitman sent by the mayor to deal with him. Just as Darius disposes of the hitman's body, Beth and Jay break in, having become concerned about the new mailman's activities, and his relationship with Daniel. After the two discover the body of the original mailman  stuffed in a closet, Darius appears, knocks them out, and ties them up, intent on raping Beth and forcing Jay to watch. As Darius strips Beth, Daniel returns, and is ordered to kill Beth by Darius, who says she is not his real sister, and that her family will never truly accept him like he does. Instead of obeying his brother, Daniel stabs him with a letter opener, and releases Beth and Jay. While a hysterical Daniel breaks down sobbing, Beth and Jay embrace, not noticing Darius's eyes open.
