The film focuses on a new resident, Joe Blackburn, who is 21 and begins the documentary weighing over 30 stone  and with fears for his health. The plot follows his struggle to integrate with existing members of the home. Since PWS often causes immaturity, the early stages of the documentary show Joe having a variety of tantrums, which have been exploited for humorous value on such sites as YouTube. The second resident that the documentary focuses on is Tamara Allwood, who was at one point close to death from overeating but by the time of filming has gained enough autonomy to gain the rights to visit her mother in London. 35-year-old Tamara has become estranged from her mother, who has never properly understood Tamara's illness, which was diagnosed relatively late in her life. The meeting is unsuccessful. However, Tamara is hopeful by the end of the documentary, as she gets back together with an old boyfriend, who vows to protect her from her desire to eat. They get engaged and she has high hopes for the future.
