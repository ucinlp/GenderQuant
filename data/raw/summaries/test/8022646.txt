A being from another planet  arrives on Earth and takes human form. In voiceover, Jack Bell  explains how his ideas came to bring the "triple M" into power and reduce human beings to mere consumers, pawns of the corporation. The innovative idea Jack contributes to Triple M is that, since sexually active people are the most active consumers, people will record each of their sexual encounters as an economic transaction. This will increase their desirability rating, their value as sexual commodities, and therefore also their credit rating. Because of its direct relation to one's credit rating and buying power, insurance policies covering a person's sexual desirability are available. Jack tries to hook up with Cecile  but fails, leading the insurance company to investigate why this happened. The insurance agent decides it's not Cecile's fault and her premium remains the same, while Jack's is raised. By chance Cecile meets up with a teenager in the counter-revolution, who takes her to a place where people have sex because it feels good. Cecile is arrested and sentenced to "two years hard labor... teaching high school." At the high school, Cecile reads Thoreau's book Walden and is inspired to join the counter-revolution. Meanwhile, Jack finds the girl from the planet Monday  and teaches her how to fit into human society. But the girl, who refers to herself as 'nobody', just wants to go home. Jack, it turns out, is also from that planet, and has tried and failed to go home. They go to the ocean, where the girl walks into the ocean. Jack says he doesn't know if she made it or not.
