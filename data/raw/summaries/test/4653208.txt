The film follows Detective Harry Griswold , a clumsy NYPD cop investigating a string of murders involving Kabuki actors. While attending a Kabuki play, Harry witnesses mobsters gun down the entire cast. In the ensuing gunfight, Harry is forcefully kissed by one of the dying actors, unknowingly becoming blessed with the powers of Kabuki. Before he knows it, Griswold finds out that he has the ability to transform into Kabukiman, a colorfully-dressed slapstick superhero who has the ability to fly and access to such unique weapons as heat seeking chopsticks and fatal sushi. With the assistance of the beautiful Lotus , the two help clean up the crime-ridden streets of New York and try to stop a maniacal businessman  and his lackeys who plan to fulfill an ancient evil prophecy that will summon demonic powers and enslave the world.
