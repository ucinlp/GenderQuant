Judgment at Nuremberg centers on a military tribunal held in Nuremberg, Germany, in which four judges are accused of crimes against humanity for their actions during the Nazi regime. Judge Dan Haywood , the chief justice in the case, attempts to understand how defendant Ernst Janning  could have passed sentences resulting in genocide, and by extension how the German people could have turned blind eyes and deaf ears to the Holocaust. Doing so, he befriends the widow  of a German general executed by the Allies. He talks with a number of Germans with different perspectives on the war. Other characters the Judge meets are U.S. Army Captain Byers , who is assigned to the American party hearing the cases, and Irene Wallner , who is afraid to bring testimony that may turn the case against the judges in favor of the prosecution. The film examines the questions of individual complicity in crimes committed by the state. For example, defense attorney Hans Rolfe  raises such issues as the support of U.S. Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. for eugenics practices, the Hitler-Vatican Reichskonkordat in 1933, the Nazi-Soviet Pact in 1939 that allowed Hitler to start World War II and Winston Churchill's praise for Adolf Hitler.{{fact}} At the end of the film Janning thanks Judge Haywood for his rulings, saying that it was the right and just decision.
