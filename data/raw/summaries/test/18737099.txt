The story was written by Waheed Murad. It boasts a sensitive script as psychiatrist Waheed falls in love with and woos young widow  Zeba, a romance that was decidedly different for its time. Complications obviously arise but the movie remains surprisingly mature and for the most part doesnâ€™t turn into a typical Lollywood melodrama.http://www.dawn.com/weekly/review/archive/040902/review12.htm
