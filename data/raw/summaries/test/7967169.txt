The film depicts a small family, struggling to get by on a tiny island in the Seto Inland Sea. They are the island's only occupants, and survive by farming. They carry water for their plants and themselves in a row boat from a neighboring island. While the parents are away from the island, the older son falls ill. The desperate father runs to find a doctor to come to treat his son, but when they arrive, the boy is already dead. After the boy's funeral, the family resumes their hard life, with very limited opportunity for grief.
