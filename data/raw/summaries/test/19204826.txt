Herbert Harris is a traveling salesman who makes his way into a remote Italian village to sell his wares. There, he finds many single and attractive women who all pursue him madly. He quickly learns that the village has all but one single man left, as the majority have left to find work. The only single man left is Antonio, a wealthy foreigner who is looking for a bride. Due to the large selection of women, a rule was created prior to the arrival of Harris, that the first outsider to enter the village would be the one to make the ultimate choice of the man's bride.
