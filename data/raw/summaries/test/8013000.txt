As the movie's title implies, Daffy Duck stars in an Ebenezer Scrooge-like role in the Looney Tunes retelling of this classic tale. In the beginning of the movie, Bugs Bunny  pops up out of his hole to clear away the snow, and explains to the viewers he's a rabbit of all seasons, despite the fact rabbits are associated with Easter. He's then almost run over by Daffy Duck's gas guzzling Hummer. Daffy is the scrooge like owner of the Lucky Duck Superstore , and he treats his employees  like they're garbage. Despite Bugs' scolding him for berating Playboy Penguin, Daffy still acts snobbish and tries to abscond with the money Priscilla Pig, Egghead Jr., Henery Hawk and Barnyard Dawg Jr. are collecting for charity. Daffy especially has trouble with his hover scooter, and gets beat up by his own employees  and the customers . After Daffy states he hates the holidays, Bugs warns him about the Ghosts of Christmas, which Daffy simply scoffs at. After working his employees to the bone on Christmas Eve, Daffy expects them all back at 5:00am on Christmas Day, so he can make more money off of last minute shoppers. Assistant Assistant Manager Porky Pig in a Bob Cratchit-like role pleads to let him go home for Christmas and spend time with his daughter, Priscilla, who is in a Tiny Tim-like role, but Daffy refuses and Bugs warns him that bad things happens to people like him  and tells him "Bah, Humduck!",  which Daffy then takes as his own. Later that day, the spirit of his deceased business idol Sylvester The Investor  who is clad in chains as punishment for his greed, and he warns Daffy that if he doesn't change his ways, he will be doomed to the same fate. He tells Daffy that he still has a chance of escaping his fate and foretells that three spirits will visit him but Daffy thinks that this is a trick by Bugs and does not believe him. Daffy, trapped in the store by a snowdrift with Bugs, locks himself in his vault to be safe. But the ghosts are not that easily stopped. The Ghost of Christmas Past who took on the form of two things an old lady and a bird ([[Granny  took him back to his childhood, where they see that Daffy lived at the Lucky Duck Orphanage , and every Christmas, he was ignored by potential parents, which explains his cold demeanor in the Present Day. The Ghost of Christmas Present  then appears, and shows him how sad his employees are and tells him if he doesn't change his ways, his future is very bleak. By this time, Daffy is starting to feel tender emotion , which earns him another one of the Ghosts' numerous beatings. By this time, he actually dreads the visit of the last ghost and begs Bugs to hide him from it. After a reenactment of Bugs and Daffy's hiding routine, he is left alone and the last ghost appears. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come (the [[Tasmanian Devil  comes and shows him that because of his greed and selfishness he is dead and his store is permanently closed , leaving everyone out of a job, but allowing them to spend Christmas with their families just like they wanted. When Porky's daughter promises to visit Daffy's grave every Christmas because no one should be alone on that holiday, his cold demeanor melts and his heart breaks. Realising his greed and selfish nature was to cover up his real wish to be part of a family, Daffy proclaims to be a changed man. Returning to the present, he gives Porky a promotion, hires Playboy Penguin as one of his employees, everyone the gifts that they want and a promise of a raise. There is a brief moment when he slides back to his greedy self, contemplating just how he is going to recover all the costs. However, it immediately fades when Priscilla presents cookies in the shape of a duck and calls him uncle. Daffy thinks she's pushing it until she kisses him and he lets her call him "Uncle Daffy". After Bugs munches on a candy cane, the camera pulls out of the mall to end the movie. Porky and Priscilla finish the movie saying the famous line: "T-T-T-That's all folks!"
