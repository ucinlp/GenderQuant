Goopy Gyne and Bagha Byne have ruled the kingdom of Shundi and are bored of royal luxuries. They want to get back to the days of adventure they had enjoyed all their lives, but age comes in the way. They leave the kingdom in search of new experiences. Finally, they reach Anandagarh and win the king's heart with their musical abilities and powers. In the court room they meet Brahmananda Acharya, who invites Goopy and Bagha to come to Anandagarh fort. When they go to his place he offers them a job to steal three valuable stones, making use of their miraculous powers gifted by Bhuter Raja . In return he promises to make them 20 years younger. They steal two rare stones with a hope to become young again. But However, in their dream the King of Ghost appears and advises them to keep off injustice. They apologise to him and return the stones to the respective owners. Brahmananda Acharya had gained immense powers, as shown when he was not rendered motionless when they sung in front of the court. But, due to his greed of gaining rare and valuable stones, he was not offered immortality. It was foretold that a 12 year boy, named Bikram, with divine powers, would defeat him. To prevent his death, Brahmananda Acharya had all the boys in Anandagarh, who were 12 years old and were named Bikram, kidnapped by his soldiers. He hypnotized them, making them his servants. In the end, Goopy and Bagha find out that one boy named Kanu was previously named Bikram. He was to receive divine powers at the age of 12. He, along with Goopy and Bagha, goes towards Anandagarh fort. There, as Bikram entered the fort and came close to Brahmananda Acharya, the Acharya sank beneath the ground, signifying that he had been destroyed. His valuable stones also vanished.Goopy Bagha Phire Elo in Gomolo.in
