Sudo  is a disfigured World War II soldier who had been wounded, robbed and left for dead by his fellow soldiers years before. Under the alias "Goro Nakamoto," he is armed with the bayonet that had been used to wound him, and uses the Clariotron, a device that can give its user the ability to teleport anywhere. The inventor of the machine, Professor Niki, was unaware that it was being used. As an act of vengeance, Sudo uses the Clariotron to hunt down the soldiers, killing them one by one and leaving an ID tag on each of the bodies. Kirioka  and detectives Onosaki  and Kobayashi  are assigned to investigate the murders.
