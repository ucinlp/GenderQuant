A clueless, aspiring criminal named John "Rugged" Rudgate  spends his days forging rebate coupons and selling speakers out the back of his van. One day, Rugged runs into an old acquaintance, the dim-witted Jeff Lagrand , who recently returned home to help his cynical sister run the storage facility that they inherited from their father. When Rugged tries to force his way into the Lagrand family business, things go terribly wrongâ€”and the situation gets even more complicated when an emotionally unstable cop begins investigating.
