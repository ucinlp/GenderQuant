The beautiful yacht is then dashed upon the new island and is destroyed just as the submarine dives beneath the surging waves. The submarine is pulled downward by the rise of the rocky headland and spirals out of control. Buffeted by the surging currents and thrown off course the stunned crew and passengers find themselves inside a deep underwater revin. The submarines' crew look through the port hole to see green water filled with strange monsters, their amazement is cut short with a sudden jolt as the sub runs aground on a volcanic shelf, the submarine then surfaces to find its self on a tropical lake surrounded by steep cliffs. They have traveled through deep underwater caverns and have surfaced in the cauldron of an extinct volcano. The crew soon discover that dinosaurs exist on the island and promptly escape from a stampede of Brontosaurs. Later on shore, the Chilean crew are attacked by a prehistoric rhinoceros-like mammal known as an Arsinotherium while trying to cross a log bridge.
