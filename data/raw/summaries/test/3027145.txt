The film is based on the true story of a missing Australian child, Stephen Walls . After his disappearance,a massive search is organized across the Guyra area as its citizens spring into action. The problem in finding Stephen is that he was taught to not speak to strangers, and is afraid of those who attempt to speak to him. He does not know that the crowds of people attempting to make contact are not enemies, but have volunteered to find him. Four days elapse and hope of his rescue diminishes. A group of searchers finally spot the boy and are able to convince him that they are there to help him get back home to his family.
