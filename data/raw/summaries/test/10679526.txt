The Sick-Little-Well-Girl  has been wrapped in cotton wool all her life. At the sign of the slightest sniffle or cough, she is packed off to bed and each time, the stuffy  Dr Ludwig von Saulsbourg  is called to attend to her. In another town lives Doctor Jackson , a friendly and altruistic doctor who is liked by everyone in town. He utilises common sense when curing the citizens of any ills. Soon, Doctor Jack discovers that von Saulsbourg has been playing on The Sick-Little-Well-Girl's non-illness, charging the girl's father exorbitant amounts of money to "treat" her. With Jack's intervention, von Saulsbourg is sent packing.
