The film opens with a Malla Yudha  scene. A great wrestler comes to the city and nobody could take his challenge and the whole country of Virata gets ashamed. At that time Bhima the cook comes and challenges him resulting in a royal wrestling match, one of the finest on stage, and Bhima defeats the Malla. Once Panchali was plucking flowers for making garlands. Keechaka, the queen's brother, sees her and addresses her with a request to be his love. She refuses. Then Keechaka approaches the queen and requests a favour. He says he wants the company of Panchali, the dasi. The queen is annoyed but considering the strength and status of Keechaka she tells him that she will send her to Keechaka's room. The queen asks Panchali to take food and wine to Keechaka's room. Panchali is aghast. She tells many reasons why she cannot go. But the queen strictly orders her to go. She takes the vessels containing food and wine and proceeds to Keechaka's room. When Keechaka sees Panchali he is delighted. He offers to press her tired legs. He asks her to sit on his well-made bed. Panchali starts running away but Keechaka chases her, often beating her, but swift footed Panchali escapes. Panchali reports to Bhima, the cook, about the incidents. Since they are living incognito Bhima devises a plan. He tells Panchali to tell Keechaka that she will meet him at the dance house in the night when nobody will be there. She does that. Bhima lies down in the dance house and covers himself with a bedsheet. Keechaka comes searching for Panchali and addresses the sleeping Bhima thinking Panchali is inside. When he tries to lift the bed sheet Bhima takes hold of his throat and suffocates him to death. This is the story of Keechaka Vadham.
