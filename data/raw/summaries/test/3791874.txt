The movie centers on three flight crew members of a USAF Air Rescue Service HU-16 Albatross and various experiences in their collective pasts, told in flashback. Some have considered the flashbacks as tedious and boring, but the aircraft sequences are generally considered quite good, especially for fans of the Grumman Albatross. Richard Widmark plays Colonel Stevenson ; Yul Brynner portrays Master Sergeant Mike Takashima  and George Chakiris portrays the co-pilot, Lieutenant Gregg.
