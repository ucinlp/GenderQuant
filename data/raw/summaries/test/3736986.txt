The Agents are hot on the trail, chasing the villains across the world. Their pursuit takes them to Vienna, and to Algiers. Upon the way they encounter the STENCH agents, the Fat Man and Milchmann . Unfortunately the agents' lack of experience results in their contact agent, Carstairs , being floored in an encounter with the Fat Man, and they also encounter the mysterious Lila , whom they are uncertain if they can trust.
