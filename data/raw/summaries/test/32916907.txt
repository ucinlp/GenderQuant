Englishman Martin South  is leading an expedition into the Dutch New Guinea hinterland to search for gold, being joined by George Mardyke , who he thinks is his friend. The expedition is attacked by headhunters and Mardyke leaves Martin for dead so he can pursue the latter's fiancee, Eleanor , the daughter of a plantation manager. Meanwhile, Martin is nursed back to health by native girl, Hurana , who falls in love with him and helps him escape from some angry natives. Hurana is bitten by a snake and dies, and Martin arrives back to civilisation in time to rescue Eleanor from Mardyke.{{cite news}}
