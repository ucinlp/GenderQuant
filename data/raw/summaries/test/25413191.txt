Prof. Andrew Boran  is a research scientist who discovers strange radio signals in space that appear to originate from the Earth. The signals seem to predict natural disasters occurring around the globe. When he and his wife  decide to investigate the source of the signals, they end up being held captive in a convent that's been infiltrated by aliens. These invaders plan to destroy the world with the natural disasters. As the human, Father Pergad and alien leader Zindar  explain - the Earth is a hotbed of disease that cannot be permitted to continue polluting the galaxy.
