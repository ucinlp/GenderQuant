Two itinerant adventurers, Jim Rainbolt and Shaun Garrett, stumble across a gold strike. With the ruthless bandit McCracken in hot pursuit, they hide the gold behind a giant boulder. Shaun is wounded, but Doc Gates patches him up and is made a full partner. They take refuge at the ranch of Amos Gondora, an old friend of Jim's. There they are introduced to Gondora's so-called "ward," an Indian maiden called Tita. One day while Jim and Gondora are away, McCracken rides up and takes Shaun and Doc captive. He kills Doc because he is unable to tell the hiding place of the gold. Shaun does know it and, under torture, agrees to take McCracken to the spot. There the boulder rolls onto McCracken, who is trapped and left there to die. Everything seems all right until Gondora puts friendship aside and demands the money for himself. Jim and Shaun run from him and must cross a treacherous river. The gold gets away and the current carries it out of reach. All the three men can do is laugh at their combined brush with fortune and misfortune.
