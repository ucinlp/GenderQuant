Inspired by low-budget sci-fi films, comic books, and fantasy pulp fiction of the 1950s, Diabolical Tales: Part I, Genesis of the Men From Within The Earth, is set in November 1952 just days after the first secret tests of the H-bomb. Rookie FBI Agent Cooper and his partner Agent Thompson are on a stakeout when they encounter a mysterious man dressed in a black cloak. Minutes later, Agent Thompson has been vaporized by the villain's "electro-incinerator" and Agent Cooper has been stunned unconscious. He is teamed up with a cryptic US government agent known only as Operative-132 who works for the newly formed National Security Agency. Together they set out to put the stops on the evil Zong, a saboteur who hails from an ancient, hidden underground empire called Agartha. Diabolical Tales: Part II is set in December 1954, two years after the events of Diabolical Tales: Part I. A group of evil hench-women, led by the partially deaf arch-villain Zerg , are sent up from their underground fiefdom to capture the Sapphire of Agartha, a mystical relic that was stolen and handed over to heroes Agent Cooper  and Operative-132 . Diabolical Tales: Part III is set in July 1955, and picks up with Agent Cooper as his wife Kate  is kidnapped. Meanwhile, the evil men from within the earth, this time led by the cunning and maniacal Zerrath , launch a two-pronged attack against the 'surface-dwellers' in an effort to retrieve the still-missing Sapphire of Agartha and conquer the world. The events that unfold will solidfy Agent Cooper's destiny.
