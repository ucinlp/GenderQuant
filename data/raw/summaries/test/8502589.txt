A group of criminals who have kidnapped an heiress take over a geologist's home in a secluded forest to hide in. Then a UFO crashes nearby and out emerges an alien resembling a beautiful woman- however, she's highly radioactive and can kill with her bare touch. She starts stalking and killing the other characters. In the end, the alien herself is killed, but not before the scientist realizes she was only trying to ask for help, apparently unaware of how dangerous she was to humans. He fears what the reaction of her race will be towards Earth after the incident.
