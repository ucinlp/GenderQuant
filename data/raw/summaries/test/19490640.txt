The film uses the 1950s-era tuberculosis epidemic in the Far North as its starting point. The spread of the disease forced many Inuit to go to various Canadian cities for treatment. Tiivii  is taken to a sanatorium in Quebec City, from Baffin Island July 1952. Uprooted, far from his loved ones and faced with a completely alien world, he finds himself unable to communicate with anyone. When his nurse, Carole  realizes that Tiiviiâ€™s illness is not the most serious threat to his well-being, she arranges to have a young orphan, Kaki , transferred to the institution. The boy is also sick, but has experience of both worlds and speaks both languages. By sharing his culture with Kaki and opening it up to others, Tiivii rediscovers his pride and energy. Ultimately, he also rediscovers hope through a plan to adopt Kaki, bring him home and make him part of his family. The film also stars Denis Bernard, Louise Marleau, Antoine Bertrand, Guy Thauvette, Luc Proulx and Vincent-Guillaume Otis.
