The film stars Valerie Buhagiar as Ramona, an intern at a Toronto record label who is sent to Sudbury by promoter Roy Seth  to track down the label's star band, Children of Paradise, after they disappear on tour. Because she doesn't know how to drive, however, she takes a taxi driven by Buddy  for the entire 400-km route. Once in Sudbury, she finds the band almost immediately, but then loses them again and subsequently tracks them all across Northern Ontario. On her way, she encounters a variety of odd characters â€” including an indie film director named Bruce Shack ([[Bruce McDonald , who documents roadkill on the highway, and an aspiring serial killer named Russell , who's studied the profession thoroughly but just doesn't know where to start. Ramona finally locates the band in Thunder Bay, setting the stage for the film's climax.
