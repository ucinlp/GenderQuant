Igor Gouzenko, an expert at deciphering codes, comes to the Soviet embassy in Ottawa, Canada in wartime 1943, along with a Soviet military colonel, Trigorin, and a major, Kulin, to set up a base of operations. Warned of the sensitive and top-secret nature of his work, Igor is put to a test by his superiors, who have the seductive Nina Karanova try her wiles on him. Igor proves loyal to not only the cause but to his wife, Anna, who arrives in Ottawa shortly thereafter with the news that she is pregnant. Trigorin and his security chief, Ranov, meet with John Grubb, the founder of Canada's branch of the Communist Party. One of their primary targets is uranium being used for atomic energy by Dr. Harold Norman, whom they try to recruit. In the years that pass, the atomic bomb ends the war. Anna, who has borne a son, now has serious doubts about the family's future, particularly when Igor begins hearing that he is going to be reassigned back to Moscow. He takes secret documents and tells Anna to hide them, in case anything happens to him. Trigorin and Ranov threaten his life, but Igor refuses to return the papers. Grubb and two others are called back to the Soviet Union to answer for their failures. Canada's government places the Gouzenkos in protective custody and grants them residence, with a warning that a watchful eye will be kept on their activities in the future.
