The film opens in 1099 at the end of the First Crusade, depicting Christian Crusaders sacking Jerusalem and slaughtering the local population. One of the Christian knights, Charles Le Vaillant , becomes demoralized by the horrors of war, and decides to create a new religious order. This new order brings together members from the three main religions of the region: Christians, Jews, and Muslims. As a self-imposed leader and messiah, Charles writes the sacred texts of the Order, and is subsequently accused of heresy by the Christian church and attacked. During the attack, the last chapter from their religious text becomes lost in the desert. In modern-day Israel, a devout contingent of Le Vaillant's followers continues to practice his peaceful teachings, however one of the disciples, Cyrus ([[Brian Thompson  holds a distorted view of the Order's ways. Meanwhile, Rudy Cafmeyer , a thief and smuggler of valuable historical artifacts, breaks into a high security building and steals a precious Fabergé egg. He triggers an alarm in the process and is forced to fight his way out of the building. It is revealed that Rudy works for his father, archaeologist and museum curator Oscar "Ozzie" Cafmeyer , and that the Fabergé egg was stolen from the personal collection of a powerful Russian mafia boss. Ozzie discovers the lost manuscripts of the Order, lost ever since the Crusades, and reads their accounts of interfaith harmony. The manuscripts also contain an ancient map of Jerusalem, which depicts the location of a mythical Jewish treasure. Ozzie travels to Israel, where Cyrus has him kidnapped. Rudy, having heard the abduction take place while talking to Ozzie on the phone, travels to Jerusalem to rescue him. Ozzie's associate, Professor Walt Finley , gives Rudy the key to a safe-deposit box in East Jerusalem before being gunned down by unknown assailants. Israeli Police Chief Ben Ner  views Rudy's arrival with hostility and takes steps to have Rudy deported, but police lieutenant Dalia Barr  risks her career to help Rudy, subsequently revealing that she was once a disciple of the Order, but she left when she was 18. Meanwhile, Cyrus assassinates the Order's leader, Pierre Gaudet, and steps up his inflammatory rhetoric, hoping to inflame his followers. Rudy opens the safe-deposit box and finds a map that shows a series of tunnels and a treasure room beneath Jerusalem. Ben Ner, who has partnered with Cyrus, just covets the gold that the underground tunnels lead to, but Cyrus hopes to plant a bomb during Ramadan that will turn the Israelis against the Palestinians. At the film's climax, Dalia and Rudy must infiltrate the Order's monastery, free Ozzie, and prevent an explosion that will push tensions in the Holy Land past the point of no return.
