In 1940, the testimony of Chief Petty Officer Mike Mallory  at a United States Navy board of inquiry regarding a fatal gun turret accident helps end the career of Lieutenant Tom Sands . The situation is complicated by the fact that Sands and Mallory's sister Myra  are in love. Afterward, Sands resigns his commission and breaks up with Myra, telling her there is no future for them. When the United States enters World War II, however, Sands joins as an enlisted man. By chance, he is assigned to Mallory, to their mutual displeasure. They and the rest of Mallory's men are disappointed to be assigned to man the guns of the freighter Sybil Gray. When Myra comes to see her brother off , she encounters Sands, whom she had not seen since the inquiry. On board, Coxswain G. Berringer ([[Max Baer  recognizes Sands, making him a pariah among the navy sailors. On the voyage to England, they are attacked by a German U-boat on the surface. They exchange fire, before the submarine is driven off by escorting warships. As Bayless is seriously injured, doctor Lieutenant Commander Murray and Myra are brought aboard. They remain on the ship to avoid delaying the convoy further. A near encounter with a German pocket battleship in the fog causes Sands to reveal that he still loves Myra. Later, two German airplanes strafe and bomb the Sybil Gray. When Myra is knocked out by falling debris, Sands abandons his machine gun to carry her to safety. While he is gone, Berringer, the other sailor manning the gun, is fatally wounded. The two aircraft are shot down, but the sailors now believe that Sands is a coward. When "Babe" Duttson's  radio intercepts a German message, "Dutch" Croner  is able to interpret it. He informs Mallory that a German U-boat supply ship is nearby. Mallory persuades the freighter's captain to change course and capture the vessel. Unbeknownst to the Americans, the German captain has one of the torpedoes rigged to explode, but a suspicious Sands foils that scheme. Then, with a ready supply of detonators, he suggests to Mallory that they load unsuspecting U-boats with booby-trapped torpedoes. As the only qualified navigator, Sands refuses to sail to Belfast, so Mallory has no choice but to agree. The plan goes without a hitch the first three times, blowing up enemy submarines, but an officer on the fourth recognizes Dutch as a famous anti-Nazi violinist. The two ships fire at each other, and another U-boat joins the battle. The Americans sink both submarines, but the hold of the supply ship is set on fire. When Mallory goes to deal with it during the fighting, he is overcome by the fumes. Sands rescues him. For his actions, Sands is reinstated as an officer.
