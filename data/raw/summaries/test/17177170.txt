Nabin Dutta  was a 47-year-old dentist. He had a son Kushal who was studying in Darjeeling. His wife was not satisfied with him and wanted to be separated. Nabin thought he had some acute disease, but it was nothing serious. Every moment Nabin felt a lack of satisfaction. He compared his situation with his driver Dinu who had two wives, Sukhi  and Maloti . Dinu's wives were satisfied with him and they had no complaints about Dinu; even his daughter had no complaints about her father. Nabin tried to understand himself. Most of the time he thought about his childhood in Cherapunji and the red coloured gate which he thought obeyed him. His mother said that the gate had a huge tolerance and Nabin compared himself with the red coloured gate. Ultimately, after departing from his wife and son, he raised his tolerance to a maximum stage and started to live alone with himself.
