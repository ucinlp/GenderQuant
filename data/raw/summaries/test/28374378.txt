A sentry marches past a wall, upon which is painted DÃ©fense d'afficher . A bill poster waits for him to pass and pastes up an advertising bill. A second bill poster covers the first ad with a larger poster. The two bill posters squabble, and then flee at the approach of the sentry. The sentry is then reprimanded by his commander for the defacing of the wall.
