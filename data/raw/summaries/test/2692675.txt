Corset company owner and independent-thinking suffragette Rose Gillray has her wagon struck by a new-fangled horseless carriage in 1897 New York. This so-called automobile is the proud new possession of Charlie Masters, who tells her it's the transportation means of the future. At work, Rose is helping singer Molly Wade into a boldly designed new corset when she gets the idea of that being Molly's costume on stage. The show is raided by police. Rose owes money to Jim Carter, whose steel business manufactures the metal used for a corset's stays. Jim takes a shine to Rose and offers her a chance to sell his surplus of barbed wire, which is going out of fashion out west because it's gaining a reputation as life-threatening to livestock. Ending up in Kansas City, accompanied by Molly and followed by Charlie, a cattlemen's association convention seems a good place to try to sell her goods. But cattle rancher Joel Kingdon gives her the runaround, attracted to her personally but warning her against peddling wire. She tries his home state of Texas next, but once again, Joel interferes, putting the women out of business temporarily and knocking Charlie cold. Joel and Jim both end up in love with Rose and proposing marriage, but she rejects both. Charlie, though, comes along offering a ride to California, where he's got another new notion that he wants to explore: machines that fly.
