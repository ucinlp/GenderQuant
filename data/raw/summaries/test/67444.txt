Sascha Petrosevitch  is a car thief who's brought in by criminal Nick Frazier  to work for crime boss Sonny Eckvall , who apparently shot and killed Sascha's wife. FBI Special Agent Ellen "E. Z." Williams  and her team show up to nail Nick, but things go bad, and Sascha gets shot. After eight months of recovery following his brief bout of being clinically dead from the shooting, Sascha is incarcerated along with Nick in the newly reopened Alcatraz prison.  Run by the charismatic warden, Juan Ruiz "El Fuego" Escarzaga , the place is known for its new state of the art death chamber where the condemned can choose from five different ways to dieâ€”lethal injection, gas chamber, hanging, firing squad, or electric chair. Lester McKenna  is the first prisoner scheduled to be executed. An older man, he stole $200,000,000 worth of gold bricks in a heist that resulted in five deaths. Federal Bureau of Prisons head Frank Hubbard  and Supreme Court Justice June McPherson  have arrived to witness the execution, which is a result of June sentencing Lester. But she's not the only one interested in Lester. A small but well-equipped team of terrorists who call themselves the "49ers" have parachuted onto the island, and gained control of it. Led by 49er One, a.k.a. Hubbard's assistant Donny Johnson , and 49er Six , the team finds Lester, and they want him to give up the location of his hidden stash of gold. When Lester will not tell them, Donny shoots a nearby priest , and threatens to kill others if the information is not delivered. Donny's plan is disrupted, however, when Sascha decides to step in and fight back. It turns out that Sascha is actually an undercover FBI agent who has been trying to use Nick to get to Sonny Eckvall. When Sascha rescues Lester, the 49ers strap June to the electric chair and threaten to kill her, all while Ellen and her team prepare a rescue plan from the mainland. With the help of Nick and some of the other inmates such as Twitch  and Little Joe , Sascha sets out to rescue June and bring Donny down, before Alcatraz becomes everyone's final resting place.
