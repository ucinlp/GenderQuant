Krazy is having some time at a house with a human boy. The boy suddenly gets bored and cries for something. To entertain his friend, Krazy shows a ball, only to have the latter kicked it away in apathy. When the cat asks what the boy wanted, the bawling boy wishes for Santa Claus to pay them a visit. Krazy then sets off towards the North Pole to fulfill his friend's wish. On his journey to finding Santa, Krazy enters what looks like a subway station in the city. He goes through a secret passage inside and eventually reaches the exit at the Arctic. He then tries to ask the locals for directions, starting with what he thought was an Eskimo. It turns out the Eskimo is actually a vicious polar bear which chases him. To lose the bruin from behind, Krazy constructs a sled with a sail on top. While riding, things were going smoothly until he runs off an edge. At the bottom of the edge, Krazy finds a turn table and a record. He plays the record on the player and dances, attempting to carol someone out of an igloo. Unfortunately, no one comes out. While still standing and thinking what to do, a hostile sea lion hurls a snow ball at him. The impact sends him bouncing of an ice ball and onto an Eskimo woman. The Eskimo woman responds in hurling Krazy back to the sea lion. The cartoon concludes with the sea lion having fun in rebounding the airborne feline.
