The members of the local university's trust make a wager that anyone can make it through college if just given the chance. Because of this, they enlist the boys to attend the university to prove the theory. While the boys do not become academic scholars, Sach invents a "vitamin" drink that makes him invincible. They all join the football team and Sach becomes the star player, leading them to the big championship game. A local gambler sees an opportunity to make some money by kidnapping Sach and preventing him from playing. However, Slip and the rest of the gang rescue Sach and return him to the game. Unfortunately he does not have any more "vitamins", so Slip plans a ruse on the playing field that distracts the other team and allows him to score the winning touchdown. In the end, Sach cannot reproduce his "vitamin" formula, but he does produce a new concoction that allows him to fly!
