The film follows three street children, Sugeng, Heru, and Kancil , in their day-to-day lives in Yogyakarta. Although they live in poverty, are from broken homes, and must sell marijuana to survive, they aspire to rise above poverty and hope to receive an education. They are supported by Asih , a saleswoman who lets them stay in her workshop; the children fight over Asih's leaf pillow. The children's lives do not go smoothly. Sugeng dies after attempting to help another street child, while Kancil is decapitated while playing on top of a train. Heru falls victim to an insurance scam, where he is given false identification papers and then killed to collect the premium.
