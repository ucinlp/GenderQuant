Murphy plays the role of Emily. Her alcoholic mother, Resse, tells her that the disease runs in the family, and she is at risk of having it too. After Resse kills herself in the bathtub, she leaves a recorded tape saying "I'm sorry Emily, but I'm just so tired." Devastated, Emily turns to drink, and the prophecy comes true. However, after seeing what alcohol has done to her life, Emily drives to a lake and tries to drown herself. At the last minute, she gasps for air and says "My mother chose to die. There was nothing I could do to ease her pain. Except maybe, choosing to live."
