Bugs pops out in Golden Gate Park and encounters a man, who asks Bugs to hold his balloons while he ties his shoelaces. Bugs complies, but soon finds himself drifting off into the ocean. Eventually he clashes with a stork delivering a joey, in which Bugs is switched with the joey and is brought to Australia, dropped into a kangaroo's arms. Bugs refuses to be the kangaroo's baby, but feels guilty after the kangaroo starts crying and agrees to be its 'baby'. After a wild ride inside the kangaroo's pouch, Bugs gets out and is then struck by a boomerang thrown by an aborigine, whom Bugs later calls "Nature Boy". Bugs throws the boomerang away but it hits him again. 'Nature Boy' confronts Bugs teases him into a yelling fit. 'Nature Boy' throws his spear at Bugs, who runs and dives into a rabbit hole. Bugs tricks 'Nature Boy' into thinking he's stabbing the rabbit down the hole, then kicks the man down the hole. Later 'Nature Boy' spies Bugs walking and attempts to shoot a poisonous fruit at him, but Bugs blows through his bamboo blowgun causing the man to ingest the fruit instead. 'Nature Boy' then chases Bugs in a canoe and then up a cliff where the two of them fight in the kangaroo's pouch. Finally Bugs kicks 'Nature Boy' out and the kangaroo kicks him off the cliff. Then the joey floats down from the sky into his mother's pouch. The kangaroo gives Bugs a ride back to the US, using an outboard motor to power the kangaroo across the sea.
