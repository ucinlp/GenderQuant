When Colonel Rimfire announces at the Looney Club about his beliefs that cats are the most intelligent animals (after his many plans were foiled by [[Cool Cat , Granny, hoping to raise enough money to save a nearby children's park, makes a wager that her Tweety can fly around the world in 80 days, collecting the pawprints of 80 cats in the process. Sylvester, still hoping to make Tweety his personal snack, is incensed at the thought of some other cat getting the little bird first and vows to follow Tweety around the world and catch the canary himself; unbeknownst to either one, a thief is also present. Tweety continues his adventure while meeting some of his friends along the way and making a new one known as Awooga . When their adventure is almost completed, Sylvester has a chance to frame Tweety by passing his license to fly for a stolen passport. He almost succeeds, but the real passport is in his hand, thus getting himself arrested. With his helping hand, Tweety and Awooga are able to complete their mission and save the park, whilst Sylvester heads off for prison.
