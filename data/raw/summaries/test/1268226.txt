The story follows Xavier , a 24 year old Frenchman, who leaves his girlfriend Martine  and his country for the ERASMUS programme in Barcelona, a prerequisite for a job with the French government. On the flight over, he meets a young "uncool" French couple  who let him stay in their flat while he searches for a place to stay. Xavier manages to find an apartment with other people from all around Europe, including England, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Denmark with whom he becomes good friends. Martine pays Xavier a visit, returns sad. Xavier eventually has an affair with the French neurologist's wife , with whom he has been exploring the city. One of his roommates, Wendy from London, has a visiting brother named William who is quite abrasive and rude, resulting in some funny dialogues. Xavier's girlfriend has an affair and breaks up with him over the telephone. Xavier becomes somewhat depressed and asks his friend the neurologist for help. Anne-Sophie tells her husband about the affair and he tells Xavier not to see his wife again. Then Wendy has an affair with an American, but her boyfriend Alister makes a surprise visit and William pretends that the American is actually his lover. At the end of the film, Xavier returns to Paris and gets the job at the Ministry but runs away on his first day at work and becomes a writer. The meaning of the story is based on Erasmus' famous essay The Praise of Folly which discusses the superiority of folly over conventional wisdom.{{citation needed}}
