A common factory worker named Nora has always dreamed of becoming a princess. When she learns about an upcoming "Memburu Impian" competition, she submits her name as an applicant. She is overjoyed when she is picked as the winner, in which she will be given an all-expense-paid experience as Princess for one week, during which her exploits will be filmed for the "Puteri Impian" television show. Nora revels in the experience, where she is given a thorough makeover and lives luxuriantly in the Istana Hotel . The only shortcoming of the experience is her cameraman, Zulkifli, who immediately antagonizes her and mocks her for her wide-eyed naivety. However, Zulkifli's warning comes true when, during an event that Nora officiates as a princess, she is jeered at by onlookers who point out that she is nothing more than a dressed up nobody. Matters become complicated when Nora crosses paths with Tengku Faizal, who is a real prince. Tengku Faizal is enchanted by Nora's simple ways and sweet demeanor, and the two start dating. Zulkifli reacts to this jealously, to which Nora responds by using Tengku Faizal to keep Zulkifli at bay. When Tengku Faizal's parents learn that the prince is considering proposing to Nora, the Queen confronts Nora directly to let her know their disapproval. The film ends with Nora, wiser from the experience, rejecting Tengku Faizal's proposal and returning to her simple life as a factory worker after the show ends. Zulkifli approves of her decision, but does not approach her.
