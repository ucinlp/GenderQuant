Chef Th√©mis, the founder of the Cooks Without Borders organization, returns to his country of origin, Madagascar, to teach classes and show the underprivileged how to cook. With very few means, he manages to reunite a first class comprising eighteen people. From his enthusiasm as he starts out to his doubts when faced with the gigantic task that lies ahead of him, the film accompanies him over the three years the project lasts. Beyond their adventure, the film asks a question that any emigrant may face. Querying exile and the need to repay a moral debt to the country they left behind.
