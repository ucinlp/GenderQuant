Erickson  is an American-born Swedish oil man who is pressured by Allied intelligence agents, led by an acerbic British agent , to spy for the Allies. Erickson begins his job reluctantly, as it causes marital discord and forces him to pose as a Nazi. He agrees because otherwise his business would be destroyed by the Allies, but over time, realizes it is the right thing to do. He is influenced in making this moral decision by one of his contacts in Germany, a religious woman  who gives him guidance on the meaning of life and right and wrong. Erickson has a number of close calls, but eventually escapes to Sweden in a harrowing sea voyage.
