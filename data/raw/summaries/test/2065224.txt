Dil Ka Rishta is about a young man named Jai . He is very wealthy and supports many charities. One day, he accompanies his friend Anita  to a school for the deaf. There, he meets Tia , a teacher, and falls in love with her. He helps her wherever he can and tries to be near her—and he believes that Tia feels something for him, too. When he finally admits his feelings, Tia reveals the existence of her fiancé Raj , and leaves Jai. She begins to hate Jai as he tried to win her earlier. Tia marries Raj and they have a son named Anshu. The trio live a poor but happy life together. Jai is devastated, since several attempts to win over Tia's heart, fail. One night, being completely drunk, he drives home and causes an accident: Anita, who was with Jai in the car, dies immediately and so does Raj, who happened to be the driver of the other car. Tia herself survives but loses her memory. The doctors believe that Tia will not be able to handle the return of her memories and advise Tia's mother  to move her daughter to a place where nothing reminds her of her past. Jai wants to look after Tia  and offers to take Tia and her mother to South Africa where they can live with him. Tia's mother accepts for Tia's sake, though she loathes Jai for taking away her son-in-law and her daughter's memories. Tia is told that Anshu is Jai and Anita's son. Tia is told that Anshu loves his "aunt" very much and that she should look after the boy so he won't miss his mother too much. In Africa, Tia's mother realizes Tia's emerging feelings for Jai and warns him not to do anything inappropriate. Jai looks after Tia, but whenever she is trying to get close to him, he keeps his distance. Even as Jai's father  tries to set them up, Jai refuses her—even though he loves her more than anything else. Finally Tia's mother accepts the fact that her daughter is in love with Jai and agrees: they can get married. When Tia looks for Jai's approval, things get out of control. Tia flees and Jai follows her: after a car-chase sequence they have a fight. The truth is revealed: Anshu is Tia's son and she is a widow. Jai's father, who has finally arrived with Tia's mother, explains that Jai is very much in love with Tia, but he hopes  that she regains her memory and punishes him for what he did: killing her husband in the car accident. Instead of a punishment, Tia forgives Jai, telling him that the past is gone and she cannot remember it anyway. She decides to leave Jai and takes Anshu with her. Jai stops her: He wants to be a father for Anshu, tells her that he loves her and asks her to marry him. Tia accepts and they get their happy ending.
