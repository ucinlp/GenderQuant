The film begins with a young woman being attacked by Deathmask and Hideous Dancer, and her blood being drained. This appears to have no real bearing on the rest of the film. Cassie and Sean, as well as ex-boyfriend Matt and good friend Annabel, decide to go for one last bash before they start at university. The four go to a club situated in an old church, where instead of one's hand being stamped, it is branded. While at the club, Cassie sees two strange figures: a man with a clear, plastic mask  and an imposing man with a scarred face . Deathmask tries to grab her on the dance floor, and she pushes him away and steps outside the club with Sean. In the parking lot, Matt eavesdrops on their conversation. Sean confesses his love for Cassie, who claims she feels the same way, but seems unable to say the words 'I love you' in return. Sean returns to the club to find Annabel, and Matt convinces Cassie to give him a last 'goodbye' kiss. Sean sees this, and reacts badly to it, giving Cassie the silent treatment as they drive away. While he ignores her attempts to explain, Cassie, who is behind the wheel, continually looks away from the road. Eventually, the car crashes, and Cassie's next memory is of being rushed to the hospital. Matt and Annabel are unharmed, but Sean has been killed on impact. During the school term that follows, Cassie has several visions of Sean, as though he isn't really dead. Matt is constantly in her company, and sometimes she mistakes him for Sean. Cassie also has numerous visions of Deathmask and Hideous Dancer, even to the point of seeing Matt and Annabel in their company. On several occasions, she believes she is being chased by the two men, although Annabel and Matt assure her that the incidents are all in her mind. While Deathmask chases her through the campus, Cassie faints, and is rescued by Father Jude, a young priest . Father Jude is sympathetic to her fears, and offers to listen if she ever needs someone to talk to. In an effort to cheer her up, Matt signs Cassie up for a swimming competition. Annabel is constantly trying to get Cassie to leave her dorm room -- specifically, to go dancing at the club. In an aborted effort to drag her along, Annabel introduces Cassie to an androgynous creature named Raven, who seems to have some kind of precognitive powers. Raven claims that Cassie is in the 'wrong place', and that she belongs 'with Sean'. A few nights later, after being chased again, Cassie knocks at the church door, and Father Jude gives her sanctuary. He gives her an amulet depicting St Jude, and encourages her to stay strong, then allows her to sleep in his small room in the church. Upon awakening that morning, Cassie sees that the calendar in the room reads 1981. She enters the office of the attending priest and asks to speak to Father Jude. The attending priest says that Father Jude died in 1981. After the swim competition, which Cassie wins, she is chased through the women's locker room and university pool by Deathmask. Defending herself with the tube of a florescent lamp, she ends up stabbing him in the stomach with it. They fall into the pool, and Cassie flees. She runs into Matt, who claims that there is no one in the pool; indeed, when the two return to the pool, there is no body in the water. Even though she believes that Matt and Annabel are conspiring against her with Deathmask and Hideous Dancer, Cassie requests that Matt take her home to her mother. Matt instead drives Cassie to the club, saying that he wishes to pick up Annabel. Cassie follows him into the club, but gets lost, eventually finding Annabel and Raven in a bathroom. When Raven tells her to leave -- or die -- Cassie makes her way back to the parking lot. In the car with Matt, he drunkenly insists on another 'goodbye forever' kiss. Cassie hits him with a bottle and pushes him out of the car, then drives away. In a scene much like the original car accident, Cassie wrecks the car. She again comes to in the hospital. On a gurney next to her is Raven, who speaks a few words of comfort before dying. Cassie also appears to die, and a priest arrives to perform the Last Rites. Father Jude arrives and takes Cassie's hand, asking if she would be willing to die in order to save Sean's life. Cassie says she would. He then asks her if she would be willing to live for him. Cassie says that she doesn't want to die. After a nightmarish dream, in which Deathmask and Hideous Dancer strangle her with her St Jude medallion, Cassie awakens. The entire film has been a sort of coma-dream: in the original accident, Cassie and Sean survived, while Matt and Annabel were killed. The occupants of the other car -- Raven, Deathmask, and Hideous Dancer -- were also fatally injured. Cassie spent the course of the film in a half-dead, half-living state, wherein those who were killed in the accident attempted to keep her with them. Father Jude, and Cassie's visions of Sean, were what brought her back to life.
