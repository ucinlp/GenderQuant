Junior Jackson  is the nerdy son of a former All-American football hero, Jarring Jack Jackson . His mother  is another former star athlete, having been a champion Olympic swimmer. Junior is something of a disappointment to his father, who has a difficult time understanding how two athletes could produce such a weakling. Junior is more interested in animal husbandry than sports, but his father has other plans. In exchange for free tuition to college, Bill Baker  makes a deal with Jarring Jack to turn his son into a football star. Junior somehow makes the team, in addition to falling for beautiful co-ed Terry Howard . He is too shy to talk to her, however, so she winds up falling for Bill. Some misadventures follow, including Junior scoring a touchdownâ€”for the opposite team. To keep up the ruse , Bill and Terry continue to support Junior and build his new-found confidence. Junior confides to Bill that he intends to marry Terry, so a guilt-ridden Bill gets drunk and makes a scene at Terry's dorm. As a result, he is expelled. Junior, finding out the truth about Bill and Terry, is determined to make things right. He goes on to win the big game single-handedly and lives up to his father's expectations, who proudly exclaims, "That's my boy!"
