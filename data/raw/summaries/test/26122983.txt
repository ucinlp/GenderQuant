Oliver Wyatt  lives with his mother Hannah Wyatt  and her live-in boyfriend Frank Donally  and spends occasional afternoons with his father Martyn Wyatt . After Oliver suffers a series of mysterious physical injuries, on which he vaguely blames neighbordhood bullies, suspicions are raised by his General practitioner father against Hannah's boyfriend, Frank. While Martyn becomes firmly convinced Frank is abusing his son, Oliver maintains a silence about the true source of his injuries, and Hannah refuses to believe Frank could be abusing her son. Martyn begins court proceedings to gain sole custody of Oliver, though his homosexual relationship with Tom Dixon  is brought as evidence by Hannah's lawyer of the unsuitability of Martyn's home. Only after she catches Frank abusing Oliver does Hannah accept that her boyfriend is the source of Oliver's injuries, though she is swayed by Frank's pleas and agrees to remain quiet about the issue and promises Oliver that the abuse will end. In the climactic scene, Oliver attacks Frank and is saved from a terrible beating by his father, Martyn, who instead receives Frank's wrath. As Frank's savagery is witnessed not only by Hannah, Oliver, and Tom, but by Hannah's neighbors as well , the film ends with Hannah visiting Oliver, who now resides with his father, and asking him if he'd like to return to her home on occasion, now that Frank no longer lives with her.  Her request is met with stony silence from Oliver.
