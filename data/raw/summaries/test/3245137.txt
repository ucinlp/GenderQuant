This is the story of Karan  and Tanya . Karan is in love with Tanya but is too shy to tell her. One day Tanya witnesses the murder of a scientist  by his evil twin brother, the underworld don Mehboob, and as a result is forced to flee the country to save her own life. The scientist had stored a secret code in a stuffed toy, now being sought by Mehboob, and he was able to hide the toy in Tanya's car before being killed. Unawares, Tanya leaves the toy at home before fleeing the country, and the toy is later picked up by Karan, who himself is not aware of Tanya's predicament. Three years later, still in love with Tanya, but depressed from her sudden and complete disappearance, Karan stumbles across old schoolmates of hers at a cafe, and discovers from them that she had been living in Dubai all this time. Karan coaxes his friend Murugan  to help him track down Tanya in Dubai. They enlist the aid of a local hustler and bounty hunter, Rocky . Rocky travels to Dubai, where his friend Babloo  has already tracked down Tanya, who has morphed into a famous singer/performer named Natasha. Rocky and Babloo stake Natasha's villa to make sure they are on the right track, but as soon as Rocky spots Natasha, its love at first sight. While he has Natasha under surveillance, Karan and Murugan arrive at the Dubai airport from India. Faced with a potential competitor to woo Natasha, Rocky attempts to eliminate Karan from the picture. Tanya, he informs Karan, is not the same girl he knew from three years ago, apparently she has been married twice since coming here and both her husbands died one by one and now she has three pairs of twins  and is also dating an underworld don. Karan is heartbroken to hear all this, and decides to go back to Mumbai, and is about to board his flight, when at the last moment, he spots a picture of Tanya  on a club advertisement printed across an airport Taxi. He is overjoyed, and assumes that Rocky made a mistake, and ended up tracking down someone else named Tanya, not being aware that Rocky is in fact trying to deceive him. Things are about to get more complicated, not only has Rocky to contend with Karan, there are two other guys already in her life trying to catch Natasha in their web of deceit. Local plumber, Sanju Malvani  has been currying favor with Natasha by pretending to be a paraplegic on crutches. Every time Natasha meets someone she likes, Sanju eliminates the competitor using a unique trick. He edits and prints out a fake newspaper featuring an article showing that person as a crook, and comes over to Natasha and shares "the news" with her while acting all shocked himself. Then there is Tanya's physically disabled live-in friend Tommy , who also has a soft spot for her. Having heard of the death of Tanya's disabled brother a year ago, Tommy has since faked being run over in a car accident and now acts like he himself is disabled and mentally challenged, thus managing to stay close to Natasha by seamlessly filling in the void left behind by her deceased brother. The most hilarious sequence of the movie commences at this point, as Rocky begins his attempted seduction of Natasha. Having wired the villa, and thus overheard what Natasha craves in a man, Rocky shows up at the local shopping mall, pretending to be an architect. Natasha, who is shopping at the mall, is ambushed in the parking lot by a bunch of thugs . Rocky intervenes, and after seemingly beating the daylights out of the supposed thugs, introduces himself to Natasha, and proceeds to show-off himself as a charming professional with a heart of gold. Somewhat awed, Natasha offers Rocky an invitation for tea later in the evening, which he accepts. When Rocky arrives at her villa later in the evening, he is confronted by several obstacles, Natasha's sister Sweety , the jealous Tommy and the family's pet dog. Rocky is easily able to charm Sweety, but has to drug the dog, who dies due to an overdose while the sisters are making Rocky a drink in the kitchen. Crisis is avoided when Rocky is able to revive the dog by electrocution using wiring from a lamp in the living room. The parties then quickly depart to the grand opening of Natasha's latest album at a social event, where Rocky now comes face to face with Sanju, who puts Rocky on the spot right away, as he himself is pretending to be an architect! The next day, suspicious of Tommy, Rocky and Babloo track down Tommy at a local disco where, unawares that he is being followed, Tommy shows up every week, for a little fun and dance away from his daily existence as a fake disabled victim. Rocky confronts Tommy while he is on the disco floor and threatens to expose him in front of Natasha. At the end, Rocky lets Tommy go, on the condition that the later will no longer attempt to get in his way of seducing Natasha. Having eliminated Tommy, and with Natasha and company under surveillance, Rocky now intercepts Sanju trying to discredit him at Natasha's home. Later, when the shocked Natasha confronts Rocky about him being an alleged imposter, Rocky is able to fast-talk his way out of the situation and convince the gullible Natasha that he is indeed not an architect, but a Captain on a ship, something his dad does not approve of, thus the ruse. The scene now shifts to the harbor, where Rocky, resplendently dressed as an immaculate ship's captain, has invited Natasha over for a cruise. While coddling her on the harbor front, Natasha spots Karan and Murugan sitting at the grounds. Unaware that Karan is in Dubai searching for her, she is overjoyed to see an old friend from her past. She introduces Karan to Rocky, not aware that they know each other quite well already! Murugan has to be held back by Karan, as he wants to knock Rocky's teeth out, having just realized that all this time Rocky was simply giving them the run-around in order to get his own hands on Natasha/Tanya. Karan seeing Rocky and Natasha/Tanya all smiles and happy, simply wants to leave them alone out of his love for Tanya. He just wants her to be happy, even if it is with Rocky and not himself, much to Murugan's frustration. While he tries to leave the scence, pretending that he and Murugan have a flight to catch, Natasha/Tanya convinces Karan to stay one more night in Dubai, and come over for dinner later in the day. In the next sequence of the movie, both Karan and Rocky are shown staging elaborate dance sequences at a club in order to impress Natsha/Tanya. Sanju shows up later at the party, and pulls Natasha aside to reveal his latest newspaper creation, showing Rocky as an international crook and fraudster wanted by many crime agencies the world over. Rocky overhears the conversation and while Natasha is occupied elsewhere, chases Sanju outside in the club parking lot. Sanju, fearing for his life, drops the pretense of being crippled, throws his crutches on the ground, and runs for dear life. Later, Rocky, Sanju and Tommy are seen sitting in a bar nearby, exposing each other as fraudsters and having a drink together, cursing their luck at the emergence of Karan as the new love in Natasha'a life. The movie ends in a slap-stick sequence when Mehboob shows up looking for Natasha/Tanya with a whole gang of thugs and Karan, Rocky, Tommy and Sanju have to rescue a kidnapped Natasha in a bizarre shoot-out sequence in the middle of the desert featuring motorbikes and go-carts.
