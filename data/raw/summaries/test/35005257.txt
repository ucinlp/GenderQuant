Nadine Bari takes us down a road in Guinea as she searches for her husband. As she does, she tells us of the long battle she faced to get the Guinean authorities to tell her what had happened to her husband after he disappeared. Hopeful and desperate, her story is similar to that of thousands of women who are still trying to discover what became of their husbands, fathers, brothers or sons during Sékou Touré's dictatorship.
