It's the beginning of baseball season, and Charlie Brown is looking forward to the new season with a mixture of joy and apprehension. The apprehension is mainly due to Lucy, who is constantly bothering him with idiotic questions, sarcastic remarks and non-sequiturs, to the point where poor Charlie literally becomes physically ill on the pitcher's mound. After his team loses their first game to Peppermint Patty's team, Charlie Brown then thinks of a great idea of trading one of his team players to Peppermint Patty. He decides to trade Snoopy for five of Peppermint Patty's players . However, the team is angry with Charlie Brown for this, and Charlie Brown finally decides to rip up the contract made for the trade . The team continues to play throughout the season normally until Peppermint Patty suggests that they should trade Lucy for one of Peppermint Patty's team members, which Charlie Brown does. Unfortunately, Lucy's replacement, Marcie, who is traded from Peppermint Patty's team, always ends up on the pitcher's mound with Charlie Brown. Meanwhile, Lucy, over on Peppermint Patty's squad, gets into her usual fuss-budget business by failing Peppermint Patty at every game the team plays by doing something stupid. When Peppermint Patty re-trades Lucy to get Marcie back, Charlie Brown's team begins to return to its losing ways. At the end, everyone but Charlie Brown leaves due to rain. Charlie Brown stays on the pitcher's mound as the credits roll, only leaving the field when the credits end.
