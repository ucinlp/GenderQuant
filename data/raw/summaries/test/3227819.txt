Sam Bell  and wife Lucy  are a married couple struggling for a baby, having tried everything they can think of to improve their chances of conceiving. At the same time, Sam begins to find his job  increasingly unfulfilling. While he resolves to write his own screenplay, he begins to suffer writer's block. The idea dawns upon him to write about his own predicament, something to which Lucy objects strongly. He uses her diary entries to help him achieve authenticity, and the film is a success. Lucy finds out about the film and, shocked, leaves Sam. Eventually they reconcile and at the end of the story are still trying for a baby. This is the second time Hugh Laurie and Joely Richardson have starred in a movie together. The first time was in 101 Dalmatians .
