Gérard is an engineer who is married to Gabrielle and has a nine-month-old son, for whom he cares deeply. When his wife leaves him for feminist reasons, he is left with custody of their son. To satisfy his romantic longings, Gerard embarks on an affair with Valérie, his son's daycare worker. However, Gabrielle fights for custody of the child, and when Gérard's affair with Valérie threatens his custody chances, Gérard responds by mutilating himself. This film lets down all barriers when it comes to - especially - male nudity. Gerard plays his role masterfully even in the dfficult position of playing several scenes complete nude. He is absolutely uninhibited and acts the pants off everybody else. His slightly ungainly body is offset by his undeniable charm and his attractive face. Unfortunately the end does not work too well as cutting off his penis would be the last thing this character would do. His love of women and sex would preclude it. His character would have gone tooth and nail into fighting to keep his son.
