Hal Wayne , a bank clerk, has absconded with Â£10,000 of his bank's money. He hijacks a plane, the Golden Eagle, which crashes in the mountains. Wayne steals the remaining food and abandons the others to their death. He is driven half-mad in the wilderness and throws away his money before being found by a prospector and returned to civilisation. But he is haunted by guilt and three years later confesses to police.
