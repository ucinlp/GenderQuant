Two convicts, St. Louis  and Dannemora Dan  befriend another convict named Steve , who is in love with woman's-prison inmate Judy . Steve is paroled, promising Judy that he will wait for her release five months later. He returns to his hometown in New England and his mother's home. However, he is followed there by Judy's former "employer", the scam artist Frosby . Frosby threatens to expose Steve's prison record if the latter refuses to go along with a scheme to defraud his neighbors. Steve goes along with it until Frosby defrauds his mother. Fortunately, at this moment St. Louis and Dannemora Dan have broken out of prison and come to Steve's aid, taking away a gun he planned to use on the fraudster, instead stealing back bonds stolen by Frosby. They return to prison in time for its annual baseball game against a rival penitentiary. The film closes with St. Louis on the pitcher's mound with his catcher, Dannemora Dan, presumably ready to lead their team to victory.[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/title.jsp?stidhttp://movies.nytimes.com/movie/115297/Up-the-River/overview|workMovies: About Up the River|firstHall|accessdate=May 27, 2010}}
