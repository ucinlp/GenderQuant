The opening prologue explaining the role of the bounty hunter and an ambush by a rifle of a wanted man is very similar to the opening of Sergio Leone's For a Few Dollars More. Scott rides into the town of Twin Forks in order to capture unknown criminals that sets the townpeople into paranoia as each person has their own secrets to hide. Randolph Scott plays the title role dressed in black. A lawman without a badge, he explains his occupation as one of wishing to enforce the law but "not wanting to break up fights or throw drunks in jail". When asked by the town sheriff why he became a bounty hunter he counts his cash reward replying "I'm counting the reasons, and they're ten short".p.105 Hughes, Howard Stagecoach to Tombstone: The Filgoer's Guide to Great Westerns 2008 I.B Tauris Publishers
