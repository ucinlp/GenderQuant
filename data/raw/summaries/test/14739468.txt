Moe and Larry are at a sanatorium where Shemp is being treating for suffering from hallucinations. Shemp says he is indeed cured, and insists on saying farewell to his new fiancée, beautiful nurse Nora . When Nora calls out to Shemp, she appears, much to the scare of Moe and Larry: poor Nora is a homely, toothless thing who seems to have won Shemp's heart. It then becomes clear that Shemp is far from cured, and needs additional therapy. While Shemp is home, the boys receive a visit from Dr. Gesundheit . The blind-as-a-bat doctor tries his best to cure Shemp, but runs into difficulty when the stubborn stooge refuses to swallow a sleeping pill. Later, Shemp hallucinates an extra set of hands while enduring his piano lesson. On the verge of a nervous breakdown, Shemp insists on seeing Nora, with hopes of finally getting married.  On the way to Nora's apartment, the Stooges become wedged in a phone booth with a stranger , leading to a fist and pie fight. When the trio arrive at Nora's apartment, they find she is waiting for her father—who happens to be the individual the Stooges brawled with in the phone booth.
