Although the plot summary here is divided into two acts, and the film was originally intended to have two acts, it was finally decided that it would work better without an intermission, in order to increase the tension in the plot.  The film opens in the streets of Manhattan in the late summer of 1957. There is a mounting tension set to music  between a white American gang, the Jets, led by Riff Lorton , and a rival gang of Puerto Rican immigrants, the Sharks, led by Bernardo Nu√±ez . The Jets harass the Sharks and vice versa, culminating in a free-for-all throughout the streets. Eventually, the Sharks catch the youngest member of the Jets, Baby John  on the playground. As they begin to "bloody" him, all the other Jets and Sharks rush in and start brawling. Soon, Lieutenant Schrank  and Officer Krupke  arrive and break up the melee. Schrank orders the Sharks off the playground and the Jets "to make nice with them Puerto Ricans" or there'll be a price to pay. Once Schrank and Krupke are gone, the Jets discuss challenging the Sharks to an all out rumble that will decide who gets control of the streets. They decide to deliver the challenge to the Sharks at a dance later that night, because it is neutral territory. Riff also explains to the Jets that they have seen other gangs  come and go, but the Jet members state that the Sharks are different compared to the other gangs. However Riff eases the statement, that no matter the odds or the situation the Jets will always pull through. Riff decides that his best friend Tony Wycek , a co-founder of the Jets who has left the gang to work at a local candy/drug store, would be the best member to present the challenge to the Sharks because he has always come through for the Jets . Riff visits Tony at the store and asks him to come to the dance, but Tony is not interested. He tells Riff that he senses something very important is about to happen to him.
