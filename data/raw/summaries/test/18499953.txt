During a Second World War Royal Air Force attack against German V-1 rocket installations during the early summer of 1944 , the de Havilland Mosquito fighter-bomber aircraft of Squadron Leader David "Scotty" Scott  is shot down during a low-level bombing raid on a V-1 launching site, and Scott and his navigator/bomb-aimer are reportedly killed. His wingman and friend, then-Flight Lieutenant  Quint Munroe  comforts Scott's wife Beth  and a romance soon develops, rekindling one that they had had years earlier. After nearly losing his own life on a photographic reconnaissance mission over the Chateau de Charlon in northern France, Munroe, under orders from a somewhat exuberant Air Commodore Hufford ([[Charles Gray , leads a Barnes Wallis-type land-use "bouncing bomb"  attack against the chateau, where, following the reported capture by the Gestapo of a French resistance fighter who supposedly talked under torture, Allied prisoners, including a very-much-alive Scott and men from their group, are also being held as "human shields", as seen in a disturbing film dropped by a Luftwaffe Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter that had, in tandem with one other, raided the base several days earlier, strafing the airfield and killing many personnel. The target is an underground tunnel in the grounds of the chateau where new weapons based on the V-1 are being constructed. In a co-ordinated raid, the prisoners are held in the chapel during Sunday morning mass in order to concentrate them in one place, thus allowing French Maquis  fighters to get them out once a Mosquito has used one of the "highballs" to blow a hole in the outer wall close to the chapel, only not before Father Belaguere ([[Michael Anthony , a Catholic priest and Maquis agent, is killed by an enraged German army officer, Lieutenant Schack , for refusing to order the RAF men to go back to their cells. The senior RAF officer amongst the captives, Squadron Leader Neale , is killed by German machine-pistol fire during the breakout as fellow comrades make their way with the help of the resistance fighters out of the chateau grounds while the bombing raid continues with a second wave of Mosquitoes dropping conventional bombs with the intention of completely destroying the building. Munroe and Scott are briefly reunited after the former's aircraft is brought down by flak, though Scott, still suffering from amnesia and unable to remember even his own name , rebuffs Munroe's attempt to get him to remember who he is, ignoring mention of even his wife's name. Scott then sacrifices himself while stopping a German tank, saving Munroe and others, but too late to save Munroe's navigator, Flight Sergeant Wiley Bunce . The next day, after rescue by a submarine, Munroe, along with survivors from the raid, is repatriated and comes back to the base in one of two Avro Anson transport aircraft, where, after being congratulated by his commanding officer, Wing Commander Penrose , as well as Air Commodore Hufford, he is reunited, albeit separately, with Beth and her brother Flight Lieutenant Douglas Shelton , an ex-pilot who had lost his right hand on operations  but now serving with the same squadron and in charge of training. However, he deliberately still conceals the secret from her that her now-dead husband had survived the crash that he had witnessed, although, thanks to the German film, both he and Shelton had, in fact, known for some time that he had not been killed as first generally believed.
