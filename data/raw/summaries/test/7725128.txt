Teresa , a postulant at the convent of Miraflores in Salamanca, Spain, is an orphan taken in by the sisters there. She enjoys the convent life, despite being a handful for her superiors. She sings worldly love songs to the other postulants and reads secular stories and plays such as Romeo and Juliet. Still, she has a lively devotion to Christ and to His Blessed Mother. A statue of the Madonna, in fact, is held in high regard by Teresa as she goes about her duties. When the British march through the town on their way to battle Napoleon, Teresa is suddenly drawn to a handsome captain . After the battle the British return to the convent which the Mother Superior offers as a hospital for the wounded. Here Teresa learns more about the young captain who had attracted her interest. He is Michael Stuart. He finds Teresa fascinating, and before long he and Teresa find themselves falling in love. Recovered, the soldiers march out of the convent grounds to be billeted in the nearby town of Miraflores. Teresa is filled with desire for Michael and begins to question her calling. Returning to duty, Michael asks Teresa to marry him; she hesitates, but runs after him. They kiss and Michael proposes that they meet at the town's inn if she wants to leave the religious life and marry him. Teresa is in a quandary. In the chapel she begs for guidance. When no tangible sign is forthcoming she strips off her postulant's habit, wraps a cloak around herself and dashes off into the night to meet with Michael in the town. At this point the miracle occurs. The cherished statue of the Virgin Mary comes to life, dons the discarded habit and secretly takes Teresa's place at the convent. A thunderstorm roars up as the statue of the Holy Mother steps off its pedestal, but it is the last rain the people of the valley will see for several years. A period of drought begins in the surrounding countryside, seriously damaging the local crops.  The French return to the town and ravage the people. Teresa is nearly raped by a French sergeant, but is saved by a band of gypsies. One of them is a handsome young man for whom the French have offered a reward, calling him Guido the Gypsy . He is the gypsies' leader. He has Michael's watch, which he gives Teresa when she reacts to the tune that plays when the case is opened . Guido tells his brother that he took it from a dead Englishman. Hearing this Teresa is aghast. When the gypsy named Flaco  mentions that he knows the girl from the convent, he laughs. As the other gypsies also laugh, Teresa, now angry with God, denounces Christianity as a lie that deceives its believers. To make her point she rips off a necklace with a crucifix and throws it to the ground, screaming that she is no Christian. What Teresa doesn't know is that Michael has been captured and taken to a prison camp. After some time he escapes and returns to the convent to take Teresa with him to England to marry her. He's too late, the Mother Superior informs him, "Teresa is now the Bride of Christ," meaning that she has taken her final vows and is now a fully-fledged nun. Michael pushes past her only to find "Teresa" in full habit , singing in a procession. Disillusioned, he leaves to return to duty. Meanwhile, Teresa, believing Michael dead, falls in love with Guido. His brother, Carlitos ([[Carlos Rivas , is eaten up by envy and jealousy. On the eve of their wedding, Guido is betrayed to the French by Carlitos. A detachment of soldiers sweeps the gypsy camp pushing Carlitos before them to show them the way. The soldiers shoot a number of men, including Guido. After the French captain tosses a bag of gold to Carlitos, he is in turn shot to death by La Roca, the two men's mother  for betraying his brother. In agony La Roca turns on the despondent Teresa as the cause of this disaster and banishes her from the camp. Flaco decides to act as Teresa's protector as they begin to wander Spain together. Coming to Madrid, Teresa flirts with Cordoba, a bullfighter while being pursued by the wealthy Count Casimir ([[Dennis King  who finances her career as a singer. When the bullfighter is gored in the bullring while smiling at her Teresa believes herself to be the cause of his death as, she believes, she was for Michael and the two gypsy brothers. During the next four years Teresa travels the Continent becoming a celebrated singer. In Belgium on a concert tour, a special ball is being prepared for the British officers stationed there to again meet Napoleon, now escaped from Elba. In her carriage, Teresa catches sight of a British colonel - it is Michael. The two lovers attend the ball. On the terrace Teresa asks Michael why, after his escape he did not come back for her. But he did, Michael tells her. In fact he is surprised to see her, considering that he had seen her in nun's habit after taking final vows. She persuades him that he must have hallucinated this while he was lying ill at the prison camp. Michael agrees. At the same time he does recall that the statue of the Madonna had disappeared. This news distresses Teresa even more; she had loved the statue so much. Just then word comes to Colonel Stuart that Michael's uncle, the Duke of Wellington, has called all officers to join their ranks. The ball had been allowed to go on as a ruse to fool all the spies infesting Belgium. Michael asks her to pray for him. Teresa has now come to a crossroads. Because she believes she is cursed, she is terrified that Michael will die in battle for having loved her. She goes to a church to pray. There she makes her peace with God, asking Him to keep Michael safe so that he may return to his own people, and not to her. She decides to return to the convent and leaves with Flaco in a coach. The next day, Michael leads the infantry charge that finally breaks the ranks of Napoleon's soldiers. A cannon ball explodes near him. Wellington sees Michael fall from his horse. Bodies litter the field but Michael comes to his senses. Picking up his helmet, he sees where shrapnel has torn a slice across it. It appears that Michael has been saved through divine intervention. Michael returns to Teresa's flat. She has sent the parish priest to tell him of her decision and to deliver a letter to him in which Teresa begs Michael not to follow her. She must return to her true vocation. In anguish Michael asks the priest for spiritual guidance, knowing that he must respect Teresa's choice and do what is right by letting her go. Teresa returns to Salamanca to find the region suffering a drought "for four years now," as a woman tells her - ever since the statue of Mary disappeared. Bidding farewell to Flaco, Teresa enters the chapel she'd left so long ago and prays. As she lies on the floor weeping, the Blessed Virgin enters, pauses to bless her, and then returns to the pedestal that had been for so long vacant. When she looks up, Teresa sees the statue on its pedestal and gazes on it in awe. Immediately, a thunderstorm erupts, the drought is over. The joyous people of the town come to the chapel of the convent, including Flaco. As the nuns assemble for prayer, they are struck with the realization that the statue of the Virgin Mary is back in its place and Teresa is kneeling in front of it, properly habited, firmly in prayer. Everyone is struck by what is considered the miraculous reappearance of the statue and join in singing Mozart's beautiful motet, Ave verum corpus.
