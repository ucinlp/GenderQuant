The movie starts off in 1861 with the protagonist Harrison Bolding  bidding farewell to his wife before heading off to war. The movie then fast forwards to 1864, during the Battle of the Wilderness. As the fighting wears down and night begins to fall, Bolding and two other soldiers, James Hogg  and After Stand Kennerly  get separated from their company and become lost in the thick woods. They happen to run into three other soldiers, John Sunderlin , Augustus Elliot , and Pietro Brolo  without realizing they are on the opposite side in the darkness of the night. The six weary men socialize by the campfire, telling stories and sharing any food they have left. When the sun rises the next morning, the soldiers now realize they come from different sides of the battlefield. As tensions grow, they are also stuck in between the rest of the Confederate and Union soldiers, approaching each other. The two sides come closer and closer, before firing simultaneously. The barrage of fire kills all the men, ending the movie.
