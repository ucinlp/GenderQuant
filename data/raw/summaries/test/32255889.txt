Set in 1944 Rockport, Massachusetts during the final moments of World War II, I'll Be Home for Christmas focuses on the Bundy family. Head of the family Joseph  and his wife Martha  await the return of their grown children, who include Mike , who has completed all of his combat missions in England and is due to come home for good. His pregnant wife Nora  has been living with the Bundys since his departure, and is now awaiting her husband's return while preparing to give birth to their first child, hoping it won't be born until Mike arrives. She eventually gives birth to a baby boy. Mike's younger brother Terrel  is currently in between boot camp and an overseas assignment, and has been at odds with his father his entire life. Meanwhile, the family's only daughter Leah  is on a bus home to Rockport, shortly after the violent death of her fiance, when she meets soldier Aaron Copler , who has nowhere else to go for the holidays. They feel attracted to each other, which leads to an invite for Aaron to spend Christmas with the Bundy clan. Completing the family portrait is 13-year-old Davey , the youngest son who hopes for the war to last for years until he is old enough to experience the action. Another character dominant in the story is Isaiah Cawley , a man of the Western Union who delivers telegrams informing people of their loved ones lost overseas. In a sub-plot regarding Joseph and Martha, the couple stretch their savings and ration stamps to obtain the best trimmings for Christmas dinner, only to be informed by Isaiah of the death of Mike because of a plane crash on Christmas Eve.
