Young newlywed Marge Farrell notices her new husband Bill is acting strangely. He doesn't show any affection towards her or anything else, including his pet dogs, which he used to love. Marge is also concerned that she cannot seem to get pregnant. She then notices that other husbands in her social circle are all acting the same way. One night she follows Bill while he goes for a walk. She discovers that he is not the man she knew but an alien impostor: An extraterrestrial lifeform leaves his body and enters a hidden spaceship. She confronts Bill and he eventually explains that the females from his planet were extinct and that he and other males are taking over human men so they can mate with Earth's women and save their race. Marge is horrified and tries to warn others of the plot, but too many men have already been taken over, including the Chief of Police. Finally, her doctor believes her wild tale and he gathers a posse to attack the aliens in their hideout. Although bullets can't hurt the invaders, they are defenceless against a pair of German shepherd dogs that the posse has. The aliens are eventuially killed by the dogs. Entering the spaceship, the posse finds all of the human captives alive, including Bill. An army of spaceships is seen lifting off around the world, seeking a new refuge.
