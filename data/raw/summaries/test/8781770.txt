To forget the tragedy Lambert heads to South America . Heading there as well is singer Clare Shepperd, using the alias Clare Sinclair . She's running away as well—not from her memories—but from her boyfriend Vic Spilato, a vicious gangster who just had his bookkeeper Edward Dawson  murdered and is under investigation by the U.S. Senate. Lambert takes up fighting once again and, as he prepares to fight his south-of-the-border challenger named Rivera, Shepperd seeks out her boss, a bar owner named Felipe, and sells him a valuable pair of earrings. She then watches as Lambert wins the match. Newly arrived to South America is Cappy Gordon , Spilato's cold-blooded button-man looking for Clare. When he finds her he expresses his love and tells her that he'll spare her life if she runs off with him. Instead, Clare jets and heads for Felipe's bar. By threatening to expose Felipe to Cappy, Clare convinces him to persuade Lambert to meet her at the secluded Posado de Don Pascual. There, Clare encourages Lambert's romantic interest, but does not tell him about Cappy nor Spilato. They take a tramway to La Cumbre, an isolated mountaintop village, and the couple enjoy a stroll through the town, unaware that Cappy knows their whereabouts. They watch a sexually provocative dance, performed by a young man and woman, whose older husband Vasco  drags her off in a jealous rage and kills her. Upset by the event, Clare and Lambert head toward the hotel where they spend the night, and in the moonlight, he kisses her. Lambert reveals that he's aware of Spilato and Clare confesses that she's attracted to him but isn't free of her past. The climax of the movie takes place on an aerial cable car high above a deep abyss which malfunctions midway through its journey, threatening to send Lambert, Shepperd, and Gordon smashing into the rocks below.
