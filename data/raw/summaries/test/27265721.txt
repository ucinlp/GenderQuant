Grace Bennett is a Texas high-school student who works as a waitress with her best friend Emma Perkins to save money for a trip to Paris after graduation. Grace’s stepfather pays for her stepsister Meg Kelly to serve as chaperone on the trip, despite Emma's boyfriend Owen proposing marriage to persuade her to stay. After being left behind by their tour guide, the three girls seek refuge from the Paris rain in a posh hotel. There, the hotel staff and paparazzi mistake Grace for celebutante British heiress Cordelia Winthrop-Scott, Grace's double, who leaves rather than stay to attend an auction for a Romanian charity for which she is to donate an expensive Bulgari necklace. The Americans spend the night in Cordelia’s suite, and the next day fly to Monte Carlo with Cordelia's luggage. At Monte Carlo the girls meet Theo Marchand, the son of the philanthropist hosting Cordelia. Theo dislikes Cordelia's spoiled nature but escorts them to a ball, where Grace successfully fools Cordelia's aunt Alicia and Emma dances with a prince. Meg reunites with Riley, an Australian backpacker she briefly met in Paris. They find they have things in common, and spend time together before he leaves for Italy. After Grace is unable to play polo well, Alicia discovers the impersonation. Believing that her spoiled niece hired a lookalike to take her place while she parties, and not wishing to disrupt the charity auction, Alicia threatens Grace to successfully continue the impersonation or be arrested. Theo is attracted to "Cordelia"'s pleasant personality, while Emma's prince invites her to a party on a yacht. Emma briefly wears Cordelia's necklace before giving it to Meg for safekeeping, but at the yacht dislikes his arrogance toward the servants and leaves. Cordelia arrives in Monte Carlo, as does Owen, hoping to reconcile with Emma. After Owen mistakes Cordelia for Grace, Cordelia discovers the impersonation. She finds that the necklace is missing as Meg forgot to retrieve it from Riley's backpack before he left France, and calls the police. The girls fail to placate an angry Cordelia; although Riley discovers and returns the necklace, Cordelia threatens to withdraw the necklace from the auction. To prevent this, the girls tie Cordelia up so Grace can again impersonate her. Cordelia escapes, and reveals Grace's fraud at the auction. She demands that Grace be arrested, but after Grace's sincere public confession Alicia bids the unexpectedly large amount of €6 million for the necklace to save her. The film ends with Meg joining Riley on his travel around the world; Owen and Emma moving into their own home in Texas; and Theo Marchand and Grace reunited at the Romanian charity.
