The film opens with Jack Stanfield  leaving his house, loving wife Beth  and two children, to his job at Landrock Pacific Bank in downtown Seattle. The day goes smoothly until Jack is visited by a collection agency, claiming that he owes $95,000 in debts to their online gambling site. He trusts a colleague to take care of it  and goes out for dinner with colleague Harry Romano  and potential employer, Bill Cox . After the meal, Harry leaves in a taxi and Jack gets in his car. Unexpectedly, Bill follows him into the back seat. Cox then goes on to tell Jack that his family is being held hostage at their home to ensure Jack's cooperation. He then points a gun to Jack's head and forces him to drive home. Upon their arrival, Jack sees that, although his family is unharmed, they are under heavy watch by Bill's henchmen. Jack is not told what to do until the next morning, when he is told that he must give Bill $10,000 each from the bank's 10,000 largest depositors . He is outfitted with audio and video devices in the form of a pen and a body microphone, making any intentions to resist useless. Once at work, Bill makes a surprise visit, reintroducing himself as Bill Redmond. Next, Jack gives him a tour of the facilities and security system. On the way back home, Jack attempts to bribe Willy, a henchman, into betraying the criminal, yet this only results in Bill killing Willy. The Stanfields attempt an escape, but the plan fails just barely. In retaliation, Bill tricks the Stanfields' son Andy with a cookie containing nut products. Because he's allergic, Andy goes into anaphylactic shock. Bill withholds the treatment , until Jack acquiesces to their plan. The next day, Bill forces Jack to fire his secretary Janet Stone  fearing she is growing suspicious. Jack downloads the files for the $100 million onto his daughter Sarah's iPod mini hard drive and then initiates a wire transfer to send the money to Bill's offshore accounts. Before leaving, Jack uses an employee's camera phone to take a picture of the account information on the screen. Bill then sets about wiping his tracks clean, deleting security data and surveillance tapes and using a virus to put the network on the entire building into disarray, setting Jack up to take the fall for the embezzlement. Returning home, Jack finds the house empty except for Liam, one of Bill's men. Realizing Liam is still around for no reason other than to kill him, Jack turns to survival instinct; he pushes Liam over a chair, grabs a heavy glass blender, and viciously beats him in the head with three blows, killing him. He then tries to call Harry using Liam's unmonitored cell phone but cannot reach his friend. Instead, he sneaks into Harry's apartment to wait for his friend's return. Both Bill and Harry enter. The criminal suddenly shoots Harry from behind, using the gun he had earlier confiscated from Jack. Because of this, along with a message planted on Harry's answering machine by Beth as she is held at gunpoint, it appears that Jack killed Harry in a jealous rage over Beth. Jack runs to the only ally he has left: his "fired" secretary Janet. He asks her for help, and she provides him with transportation to a late-night branch of the bank at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. There, he uses the picture from the phone he took earlier to get access to Bill's account and calls him. Jack tells him that thereâ€™s been a change of plans: he has hacked into his Cayman Island accounts and is stripping five accounts, $20,000,000 apiece. Bill tries forcing Jack to put the money back, but it is a futile threat. Jack informs the criminal that he will get his money when he gets his family. Next, Jack tells Bill that he will call him when the banks open to make the exchange before hanging up on him. During the conversation, Jack hears the family dog, Rusty in the background, and realizes that the family can be located and followed by the GPS tracking unit in Rusty's collar. This leads him and Janet to an abandoned house. He leaves Janet on the road to call the police. Bill shoots one of his henchmen  who had compassion for the hostages and removed the Stanfields' tape gags after Andy began to suffocate. Another henchman, Pim , chases after Sarah, Jack runs into Pim with Janet's car, hurling him into an RV, which then explodes, burning the RV, killing him and destroying Janet's car. Bill, seeing that the tide is turning against him, panics and takes Beth and Andy to the upper level of the house. Jack scales the side of the house, destroys a window and comes to rescue his wife and son, tackling Cox to the floor and forcing him to a final showdown. After a long and grueling struggle with Cox, Jack finally gains the upper hand, impaling him through the back with a pickaxe, and winning his family's freedom.
