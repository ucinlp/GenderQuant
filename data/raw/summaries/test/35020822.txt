South Korea, 2009. A few days before their wedding, veterinarian Jang Mun-ho  and his fiancee Kang Sun-young  pull over for coffee at a motorway rest stop on the way to visiting his parents in Andong, southeast of Seoul. However, when Mun-ho returns to the car, Sun-young has disappeared and is not reachable on her mobile phone. All he can find is a hairpin in the rest stop's toilet. From the mess at her flat in Seoul, it looks as if there has been a break-in. Mystified, Mun-ho then learns from a banker friend, Dong-woo , that Sun-young had earlier applied for a bank account but had been turned down when it was discovered she had a history of personal bankruptcy dating back to 2007. Investigating her debt history, Mun-ho finds she had been using someone else's name and identity. He persuades his cousin, Kim Jong-geun , a former police detective sacked for taking bribes, to help find her. Examining her flat, Jong-geun finds she left no fingerprints, had no friends and claimed her mother died two years ago. It then turns out that the woman  whose identity she assumed two years ago had a debt history and has since vanished. Visiting Sun-young's hometown, Jong-geun hears rumors she killed her mother for her insurance money. Sun-young's real name is, in fact, Cha Kyung-sun, and Jong-geun and Mun-ho realize she is now looking to take on another woman's identity. They think they know her possible target.{{cite web}}
