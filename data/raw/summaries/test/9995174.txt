Three months after the end of Le Grand Blond avec une chaussure noire, the Tall Blond Man is once again press-ganged into service, because Colonel Toulouse needs to prove that the Tall Blond Man is a real super-secret agent and not somebody chosen at random. Toulouse has a new boss—the former Minister of Agriculture has become the Minister of Interior. Perrin's assassination  and funeral  are staged—and both are comically bungled. Christine appears again, in her usual dazzling clothes. At a symphony concert—in a white backless dress, this time—she tries to shoot Francois . Eventually, Boy Gets Girl Back.
