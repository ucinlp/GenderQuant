The Stooges are investigators for the Onion Oil company, whose service stations are being robbed by a gang of crooks. On the job, the Stooges provide nothing less than first-class service. However, most of the services are not typical of your standard gas station , and they still somehow manage to be robbed when their backs are turned. Tracing a trail of motor oil to the crooks' hideout, the Stooges demonstrate boxing skills far more effective than their earlier detective skills.
