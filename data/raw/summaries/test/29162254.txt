The film's setting begins in July 1969 as 90-year-old Julius Bedford  tells young Jim  the story of how two men made the first journey to the Moon back in 1909. He relates that when he was a young man, he met Professor Cavor  at Apuldram and learned that Cavor had invented 'Cavorite', a substance that blocked the force of gravity. He tells how he encouraged Cavor to think toward the profits his invention might bring, and how the two worked together to build a cast iron sphere that would fly them to the moon.{{cite news}} The crew mention spacesuits  being on board, but these spacesuits are never seen or described or used—unlike in the 1964 film. As the Moon has a breathable atmosphere no spacesuits are used. Upon being captured by the Moon's inhabitants  who throw nets over them and knock them out with sticks, both Cavor and Bedford find themselves in a perilous state after Bedford kills some Selenites with his greater strength when they try to force him over a narrow bridge. In an attempt to escape back to Earth, Cavor decides to remain behind to give Bedford time to reach the spacecraft. Bedford almost crashes the spacecraft into the Sun, but escapes and lands close to home at West Wittering. However, his hopes of returning to the Moon to rescue Cavor are dashed when the passer-by Chessocks  accidentally takes off in the craft—Bedford does not know how to produce Cavorite and so cannot produce another craft. Cavor remains in captivity and teaches the Selenites the English language as well as some of mankind's history and the recipe for Cavorite. The Selenites determine that mankind is a threat to the Moon and decide to use Cavorite to make a pre-emptive strike. Communicating his intentions beforehand to Bedford by wireless, in an act of desperation Cavor releases the Cavorite the Selenites are producing and thus evacuates all air from the Moon's surface. This renders it a truly barren world ready to be rediscovered by the Apollo program, though the final shot reveals a Selenite observing the Apollo 11 landing. The film ends with a tribute to Lionel Jeffries, who played Cavor in the 1964 film and who died in 2010.
