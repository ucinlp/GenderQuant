In the film, ten friends who are children with monkey faces and tails, plan on going to the park for a picnic. They all ride there on their bikes, but each one meets a different fate on their way to the park as a result of their failure to follow specific bike safety rules . One by one, each of the friends makes a mistake and suffers a horrible fate. In the end only one of the friends  makes it to the park and eats all the food by himself. At the start of the PSA 'Slim' gave the human his picnic as it was large and the human had a rear basket. Seeing this, the others persuaded him to take their food, meaning he has it at the end. Thus, as the title says, "One got fat!" Three of the Monkeys are seen in hospital beds.
