Ricky Bobby  is a NASCAR driver who was born to go fast, and is raised solely by his strict Christian mother, Lucy , while his drunk and alcoholic father, Reese , is absent. When Ricky was only ten years old, Reese shows up during Career Day at Ricky's school, but after giving his vulgar speech, Reese was thrown out of the school. Before leaving, Reese told Ricky: "If you ain't first, you're last!", a quote that Ricky commits to memory. Fifteen years later, while working as the pit crew of Dennit Racing driver Terry Cheveaux  at the beginning of the film, Ricky replaces him and ends up finishing in third place, despite starting mid-race in last place. Ricky quickly soars to the top of NASCAR by achieving fame and fortune at Dennit Racing and meeting his future wife, Carly . Ricky eventually manages to allow Dennit to field an additional car to the field and arranges to have his best friend, Cal Naughton, Jr.  on his team. While he and Cal are on top of the racing world, Ricky is challenged by his rival and homosexual French Formula One driver, Jean Girard , who outperforms Ricky on the track and becomes Dennit Racing's next top driver. Desperate to regain his dominance, Ricky pushes himself too hard during the race at Charlotte Motor Speedway and ends up going airborne and his car lands upside down. While paramedics attempt to take Ricky to the hospital, Ricky ends up running around on the track in his helmet and underwear to think that he is on fire. While recovering from his injury, Ricky persists in the belief that he is paralyzed, which he certainly is not, a fact that Ricky only realizes after accidentally sticking a knife in his leg while trying to prove that he is paralyzed. Ricky's tests at Rockingham Speedway shows that he has lost his touch and fails to regain a spot on his team. Carly, yearning to be married to another top NASCAR driver, plans to marry Cal before Ricky returns to his old home that evening. Cal invites Ricky to his wedding to Carly, but his invitation was immediately refused by Ricky, who accuses Cal of damaging his life. Ricky takes his two sons, Walker and Texas Ranger  to his old home and takes his old job as a pizza delivery boy, but is reduced to using a bicycle and riding the bus after accidentally losing his license for crashing his pick-up truck into a customer's shopping cart and into the Sheriff writing Ricky a ticket for the previous incident. With Ricky's life at its lowest point, Reese suddenly re-enters Ricky's life and attempt to teach Ricky to drive by using unusual methods to get Ricky back to normal speed. With his retraining and the guidance of Reese, Ricky finally regains his confidence, but is taken back when Reese walks out on him once again. Reese leaves Ricky with the knowledge that the mantra around which Ricky originally used during his childhood years was in fact meaningless. When Ricky runs into his assistant, Susan  at a bar, she convinces Ricky to return to NASCAR not because of his desire to live up to the expectations of those around him, but because of his nature to drive fast. With Ricky heeding Susan's advice to race at the Talladega 500, he and Susan fall in love with each other. Ricky manages to make amends with Cal, Girard, and Carly before the start of the race. Because his pit crew chief and close friend, Lucius Washington  has rebuilt his engine from spare parts donated by other independent drivers, Ricky is forced to start the race from the back of the starting grid. In no time, Ricky manages to pass all the other drivers except Girard. Heading towards the final laps, Cal receives orders from Dennit to get Ricky out of the race, but Cal refuses and instead pulls ahead of Ricky, which allows Ricky to slingshot around Cal and ends up in the lead along with Girard. On lap 182, the replacement driver of Ricky's Wonder Bread car runs into Cal on Dennit's orders, causing a massive wreck that wrecks every driver except Ricky and Girard. On the final lap of the race, Ricky and Girard end up making contact with each other and sommersault down the front straightaway heading towards the finish line. Determined not to give up, Ricky and Girard sprint their foot to the finish line. Although Ricky wins the foot race, he and Girard are disqualified for getting out of their cars, and Cal officially wins Talladega 500 by default, having been in third place at the time of the wrecks. Ricky and Cal finally reconcile their friendship and family. Ricky later meets up with Reese, Lucy, Susan, Walker, and Texas Ranger in the parking lot to reunite for a dinner party during which Ricky and his extended family plan to get thrown out of Applebee's, referring to an earlier scene where Reese and Ricky leave each other again. A final scene during the closing credits finds Cal and Lucius working as NASCAR mechanics fixing Ricky's car.
