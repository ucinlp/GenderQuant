The pre-credit sequence of the film starts out with Bureau of Indian Affairs Commissioner Kirby and the last survivor of his US Cavalry escort shot and scalped by Taslik and his squaw Wanima. The film proper begins with Lt. Billings leading his patrol that has escorted Cpl Hamilton, a cartographer who has been making maps of the area. On the way back to the fort they are met by a messenger who brings orders that they are to meet Commissioner Kirby and his party at a trading post in order to deliver a recently signed Indian treaty from Washington to the Chief of the local tribe. The messenger gives the treaty to the Lieutenant who commandeers the messenger to join his patrol. The patrol, who are unaware of the fate of Kirby and his party have nine days to get the treaty to the Chief lest a new uprising start. At the trading post is Taslik, who offers to lead the patrol to the Chief. Taslik is wearing war paint that he explains is from his killing members of a rival tribe who have trespassed on his tribe's land. Unknown to the patrol, Taslik and Wanima, who is shadowing the patrol, are strongly against the peace treaty. The two sabotage the patrol's supplies at every turn in various undetected ways. On their journey the patrol discovers the remains of Commissioner Kirby's escort. The patrol finally get wise to Taslik when they discover he has led them in a giant circle looking for water. With time rapidly vanishing Lt. Billings collects all the remaining water of the rapidly diminishing patrol to fill one water bottle. This is given to one of the troopers who intends to make his way overland to the Indian village whilst the rest of the men conserve their strength by only travelling at night. Wanima ambushes the trooper and kills him but is wounded herself and becomes unconscious. At night the patrol discovers what happens, but Billings refuses to kill Wanima. This causes discontent amongst the patrol who have lost other members through drinking poisoned water and suicide. Wanima agrees to lead the patrol to water but leads them to an abandoned gold mine that sets the patrol to killing each other off to satisfy their greed.
