 The story revolves around Michael "Little Man" McCarthy and the rise and fall of marijuana dealers from Bristol, Connecticut. "The film is about a group of working-class guys trying to get ahead by selling drugs," said David, "and the value system they try to live by."<ref name newbritainherald.com | work  http://www.newbritainherald.com/site/index.cfm?newsid1641&PAG594835&rfi 9 June 2007 }}  Director/writer Brandon David based the movie on the events leading up to and following a months-long investigation by the Statewide Narcotics Task Force which resulted in the arrest of 21 people from Bristol, Plymouth, Southington, and Thomaston.<ref name courant.com | work  http://www.courant.com/features/lifestyle/hc-bristolboys.artapr03,0,2890942.story?coll 9 June 2007 }} David's friends Kevin Toolen and Miguel Rivera were arrested in the bust. David says he hoped to write on the experiences of his friends and himself while transporting marijuana with Toolen cross country.{{cite web}} Several aspects of the movie are taken directly from the real life events, such as "Little Man" being ratted out by a trusted friend. "It is a shocking fact that a good friend of Kevin's was a DEA informant," David said, which was another motivation to make the movie. Also, the police informant's death in the movie is fiction. "There was no murder, but if I were the guy that ratted everybody out, I'd be concerned," said David. David denies the movie is an attack on Bristol. "The biggest message I want to get out is I didn't make a movie about Bristol. I made a movie about something that happened to people I know," he said.
