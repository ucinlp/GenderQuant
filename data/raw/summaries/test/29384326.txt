Marissa , is trying to fight a villain named Tick-Tock , when she goes into labor with a baby girl named Maria and manages to defeat him and send him to jail. She decides to retire because she doesn't want her stepchildren and her newborn in danger and doesn't want anyone to know that she was a spy. The film then revolves around the twins named Rebecca and Cecil Wilson  who always bet and compete against each other. Rebecca has no respect for her stepmother as she thinks that she won't be able to replace her deceased mother. Their father is actually a spy-hunting reporter Wilbur Wilson , who has little time to spend with them and has to go to work and has not even caught one spy. When Earth is threatened by an organization led by a hyperion mastermind mysteriously known as "the Timekeeper" , Marissa is contacted and called back into action by the OSS and has to take the baby with her, leaving a red-sapphire necklace  with Rebecca. When the Timekeeper's thugs try to break into their house, Rebecca and Cecil escape and go into the Panic Room. A video is shown of Marissa, telling the children why the Panic Room was installed and that she is a spy. They don't believe it until their dog Argonaut talks, as he is a robot dog, and they escape in rockets and go to the OSS but then are chased by the Timekeeper's minions until they avoid them by throwing bags of vomit at them. Carmen Cortez  helps them by letting them have gadgets as souvenirs and wait in a room but they escape and create havoc around the OSS. They later go to a clock shop as they uncover a code to where the Timekeeper is hiding and become frozen by Tick Tock but Marissa and Carmen help them by activating their gadgets and they all escape. Wilbur witnesses the fight and becomes upset, and is fired for destroying the evidence that Marissa is a spy and he is upset that she didn't tell him the truth about her past. The OSS brings back Carmen's brother, Juni Cortez  since he is their best agent ever and they have Rebecca and Cecil stay back at the OSS so they don't cause any trouble. But when the director of the OSS, Danger D'amo shows up and Rebecca notices his watch is like the Timekeeper and Cecil scrambles the letters of his name saying Armageddon, they are locked in. They escape by setting Argonaut to attack mode and smashing the door. The OSS agents are all frozen except Juni because he doesn't have his badge on as Carmen threw it away. Juni uses his watch to connect to Rebecca and Cecil to get the necklace back, and he unfreezes all the agents. However, with the end of the world pending and the necklace stolen by the Timekeeper, both Rebecca and Cecil find that they have no choice but take part in the battle. As they get some gadgets and help Marissa, Rebecca has to put her anger against Marissa aside to rescue the lives that are at stake and are able to get through Tick-Tock's minions. They stop the Timekeeper who reveals he is doing this to see his father back in time, as while working on something else, Danger got frozen as a boy and kept going back in time to see him and  accept time the way it is. Following that epiphany, he disables the Armageddon device and leaves the premises an older and wiser man. Rebecca tells Marissa that she and Cecil are her kids and "the best spies ever". Wilbur handcuffs Tick-Tock, knocks out his minions, and Argonaut comes with Maria who takes her first steps. When Tick-Tock tries to charge and escape Maria flips him over her head. And Marissa saying "Baby's first bad guy". Carmen and Juni announce that they've decided to be co-leaders of the "Spy Kids" program. In the end we see Rebecca, Shawn, Emily and Cecil choose new recruits and both say to the selected recruits "You are activated."
