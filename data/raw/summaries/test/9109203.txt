The film is based on Sunil Gangopadhyay’s novel Hirak Deepthi. Dr. S.R. Nathan  is a world-renowned professor of economics. A theorist to the core, he always harps on his pet topics of poverty and developmental issues that concern the developing world. He is a loner who hits the bottle. He is not a womanizer though; in his own terms, he loves their company. His close friend Bella  is more practical. She tries to identify herself with some of the stark realities of life. Deepthi  is a housewife who stays in the same apartment complex with her husband ([[Narain  and son. Her husband is on the lookout for a job. On his persuasion, Deepthi approaches Nathan. Their chance encounter ends up in a complex relationship. But Nathan is unperturbed and quite unmindful of his ways. While Deepthi gets a feeling of guilt, Nathan just shoos it away. In fact, he is working on a book on middle-class attitudes and notions. Yet, when confronted with real questions, Nathan loses ground — a reference to the pseudo-intellectual image. Here, the director closely examines the disturbing relationship between two individuals. Deepthi is not able to pull herself away from Nathan. The undercurrents in the minds of Deepti and Nathan, their tormented souls as turbulent as the sea, are captured on frame dexterously by Alagappan, the cameraman. Though the film does not give any direct message, it does hint at what makes or breaks a relationship.
