The Tampico Stogies are a last-place baseball team based in Tampico, Florida. They refer to themselves as sports moguls, despite the team being heavily mortgaged. Their star player and manager is an aging Cecil "Stud" Cantrell , a hard-drinking, hard-playing and hard-loving manâ€™s man. At a game against the Crestview Cats in Alabama, Cantrell meets a beautiful young woman just voted Miss Strawberry Blossom of 1957, Dixie Lee Boxx . Cantrell signs a slick-fielding but light-hitting second baseman named Jamie Weeks . Weeks soon falls for a virginal and church-going local girl, Esther Wrenn , who is looking to escape Tampico. He is offered a managerial position in the minor leagues with the Cardinals organization, on the condition he does not show up for the final game. If he plays, his future managerial career is over. Brown is also bribed not to play and the team's owners, the Buchmans, are involved in the match-fixing as well. While the pennant game is being played at Tampico, Cantrell and Brown accidentally meet at a local bar where they discuss their moral and ethical dilemmas. They elect to hurry to the park and play, much to the owners' anger and regret.
