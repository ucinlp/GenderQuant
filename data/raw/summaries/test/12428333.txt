Fraternal twin sisters Rosie  & Violet  lead a life of hard knocks with very poor, abusive parents. Glad to be rid of their parents who have been killed in a car crash, the twins vow to run away to Kentucky in search of a better life. While on the road, the girls sneak onto a military base seeking food and shelter and meet up with Pete, a drifter working as a grounds keeper, who takes them in. Throughout the movie there are overtones of Rosie's jealousy over the attention the pretty Violet receives from men. For example, when Violet and Pete start a relationship, Rosie becomes increasingly jealous before eventually coming to realize that the sisters' childhood bond has been destroyed forever. Her attitude leads to actions with tragic consequences.
