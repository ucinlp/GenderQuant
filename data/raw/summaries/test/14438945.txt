The boys are painters who run into their old friend Jerry, an insurance salesman . He promises them that if they take out a policy on Curly proving that he has gone insane, they can collect $500 a month. Moe and Larry bring Curly on a leash to the office of Dr. D. Lerious . Curly's pretending to be a hound is so over the top that the doctor declares he must operate. The Stooges flee, and hide out in the back of a dog catcher's truck and are soon infested with fleas. Dr. Lerious eventually catches up with the Stooges, and Curly is sent straight for the operating room. Eventually, the trio get away on a gurney, bump into their pal Jerry, and give him the works.
