{{plot}} The film opens with Middle Eastern terrorists breaking into a secure area, to obtain a certain solution. The terrorists have a man on the inside, who betrays his fellow officers and aids the terrorists. The base is destroyed as the terrorists leave the area. Lenny Slater  is in all sorts of trouble with his college football team, when he and the quarterback, Bruce McGuinness  have words during practice. Meanwhile, the terrorists have dispatched their vehicle on a highway and obtained a new means of transport. After practice is broken up, Slater chases after Jenny  who was doing sprint training next to the football field. Slater engages her in a flirty conversation, trying his best to convince her to let him take her to the homecoming dance. Jenny says yes to Slater's offer of a date if they survive the terrorists. The bus is en route to the same water and power plant, as a field excursion. When confronted by the Professor, the surprised guard, who is a terrorist is forced to give them entry into the plant so no suspicions arise. Whilst passing through the gate, Slater spots a shotgun in the guard's office, and what he believes was a dead body behind some trash cans. When he confronts the professor with his claims, the FBI office in Santa Monica confirms that terrorists have invaded a nuclear plant and UCLA classes finished for the day at 3:30 p.m. As the other students file off the bus, Slater is left by himself. He notes a couple of men who sport machine guns, and watches them, as they perform some type of liquid extraction in their van. Inside the plant, Jenny and Slater stick together; Jenny accepts his offer, the pair then notices they get the go ahead for the school trip. The rest of the students and the professor are ordered to the hostage area. One of the terrorists, the American traitor, calls a military officer with their demands, it turns out the traitor was once a soldier under the man he is training, who left him behind in battle in the Persian Gulf in 1991. The terrorists demand that a prisoner is released or they will contaminate the city's water supply with the 'VX solution'. Slater enters the plant and finds both Jenny and McGuinness, Slater attempts to explain that the plant is being held by terrorists, McGuinness however does believe that the local news bulletins got hold of the story at 5:00 p.m., just before work finished for the day in Southern California. Slater and Jenny get away but McGuinness is taken hostage. Slater and Jenny are forced to evade numerous attacks on them, as they run and hide in various locations around the plant, meanwhile the military start to gather around the perimeter. The pair shouts out to the military but instead get shot at by a terrorist, which starts a shooting frenzy between the military and the terrorists. After a short period of time, the prisoner arrives, so the demands will be met. However, in the exchange of the prisoner, the American terrorist and his old military commander exchange words which sees the military agent being shot, which results in panic and more gunfire where the valuable prisoner is killed by a female FBI agent named Nicole Stevens. In the plant, the hunt continues for the two missing teenagers, Slater and Jenny, who take it upon themselves to try to foil the attack on the water supply. Jenny creates a distraction, as Slater is able to grab the terrorists, as Jenny uses her athletic speed to get to the small bomb in time and throw it off the water supply entry. Slater then grabs the VX solution, which he saw being extracted earlier when he was left on the bus. Slater and Jenny rejoin the hostages as McGuinness also helps, as they overthrow the few remaining terrorists. The party survives, despite McGuinness getting injured from a shot in the shoulder. The military arrive, arrest the terrorists and save Santa Monica.
