Commercial artist James Vanning  and his friend, Dr. Edward Gurston , are on a hunting and fishing trip in Wyoming. They stop to help two men whose car has crashed. John  and Red  are bank robbers, fleeing with $350,000 in loot, who don't plan on leaving any witnesses. They murder Gurston using Vanning's hunting rifle, but through luck Vanning survives. He's knocked out cold but is still alive. He awakens to discover the stolen money, left behind by mistake, and runs with it from the returning hoods. He gets away but loses the bag in the blizzard. Much later, at a cafe in Los Angeles, Vanning makes the acquaintance of Marie Gardner , a model. He is ambushed by John and Red, but once again gets away. Marie falls for Vanning and travels by bus with him to Wyoming, tailed by an insurance investigator named Fraser ([[James Gregory  who has been following the case all along. John and Red have found the money and get the drop on the other three. The crooks double-cross one another, however, and one is shot dead. Vanning fights with the other, who is killed by a snow plow. The insurance man will clear Vanning, who is now free to marry Marie.
