After the funeral of Marc and Kyle , Kyle's mom Helen  takes in her nephew, geeky but cute Casey , and gives him the number for Tiffani , Kyle's slutty fag hag friend, who hires him at her salon "Nail Me". They venture to the local LGBT center so Casey can volunteer for an upcoming event, and Casey meets Zack , a gorgeous frequent visitor. So Tiffani and Casey set up a phony online profile using the image of Tiffani's buff ex, Ryan... which works fine until the real Ryan  shows up. Ryan pretends to be gay to piss Tiffani off, so he accepts Zack's date, but later bails. Zack finds Casey to talk to, but then finds out that Casey and Ryan had both lied to him. Ryan and Tiffani both wanted to help get Casey and Zack together, so they shut the door and lock them in a room together to talk through it. But the problem wasn't getting solved, so Ryan, although he is straight, decides to strip and get into a threesome to get Casey and Zack together. Only through some fancy footwork, advice from Aunt Helen and mentor Harry, and a daring sexual escapade can Casey figure out how to set things right and perhaps even find the love he's been seeking.
