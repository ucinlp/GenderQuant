The film is set on mid 1970, when the military regime's "economic miracle" and the victory of the Brazilian national football team on the FIFA World Cup serves as a distraction for the persecution of opposition leaders by the political police of the dictatorship. Under this context, Jofre Godoi da Fonseca, an alienated middle class man, is mistaken for Sarmento, a political activist he met at an airport prior to his assassination. He is then arrested and brutally tortured by a paramilitary group of vigilantes sponsored by influential businessmen to hunt down people deemed "subversive" by the regime. Jofre's wife Marta and his brother Miguel join forces to investigate his disappearance. After they fail to get enough support from law enforcement agents, Mariana, leader of a left-wing resistance group and Miguel's former girlfriend, helps them. Their efforts proved to be useless after Jofre is killed on a failed escape attempt.
