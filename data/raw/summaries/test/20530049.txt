Out of work, Woody is weary from looking for a place to rent, and he complains about his not having any living quarters. He is then approached by city slicker Buck Beaver, who convinces him to buy some magic beans. Woody plants them, and a beanstalk shoots up to the clouds. An elevator takes Woody to a giant's castle, where he finds the dopey giant asleep and initially fails to wake him up. Woody puts mustard, red pepper and horseradish on his tongue, which does the trick. Woody hides from the giant in a stuffed olive and is almost swallowed.
