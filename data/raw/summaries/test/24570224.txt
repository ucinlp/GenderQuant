Vikas Chandra  and Aarti  have recently married, and they move into their new apartment. One day they go out to watch a late night Hindi movie at a local cinema theatre. The movie gets over well after midnight, and as no cab is found this hour, they decide to walk home by foot. On the way, they are suddenly waylaid by four men, who assault Vikas, leaving him unconscious, and forcibly take Aarti with them. When Vikas regains his senses he finds himself in hospital with a head wound. He is informed that Aarti is in the same hospital, after being gang-raped and assaulted. This incident makes headlines in the media, and is also a subject of discussion by politicians during their election campaign. Vikas feels haunted by this incident, and does not know how to act further. Aarti, on the other hand, has been completely traumatised, and is unable to trust any male. Now the couple faces a serious crisis leading to a loveless relationship, and only a miracle can bring the old spark back into their married life.
