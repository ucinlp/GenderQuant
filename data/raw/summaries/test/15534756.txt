The film is set in London during World War II at the time of the Blitz. The leads are a couple of out of work variety entertainers who use great ingenuity in their efforts to get financial assistance to "put on a show". Hoping to put their proposal to the formidable Lady Randall, ex-music hall star Lily Morris, they infiltrate her house in the guise of a servant  and cook . After some farcical interludes, they achieve their aim after Lady Randall is persuaded to sing an old music hall standard "Waiting at the Church" at an impromptu show located underground at Aldwych tube station, - used during wartime as an underground bomb shelter. As the ex-music hall star, Lily Morris plays herself. The title of the film is Arthur Askey's famous catch-phrase. Also in the film is elderly comic actor Moore Marriott who plays Lady Randall's somewhat eccentric father and the somewhat ubiquitous 'Albert'  who appears under that name in the comedy films of both Will Hay and Arthur Askey.
