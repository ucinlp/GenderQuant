After a nuclear apocalypse, the whole landscape is a desert ruin, except for a small island paradise where El Topo is buried. Though visible and seemingly accessible, every attempt to enter this island has resulted in disaster. El Topo’s sons, Cain and Abel, were separated as boys because El Topo predicted that Cain would kill Abel. But when evil marauders steal their mothers’s body in an attempt to trick their way into the island, the brothers join forces to deliver their dead mother to be buried with their father. Not only must they overcome an enemy adept at technological witchery, they must overcome the curse that marks their destiny.{{cite web}}http://www.parallelmediafilms.com/#/films/abelcain
