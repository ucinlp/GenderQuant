Poo informs Rahul that Rohan is her friend's cousin who has shifted from India to London to pursue his studies and needs a place to stay. Rahul reluctantly agrees to let him live with them. When Rahul eventually finds out about Rohan's identity, Rohan begs of him to return home. Rahul refuses, as he believes that Yash does not love him.
