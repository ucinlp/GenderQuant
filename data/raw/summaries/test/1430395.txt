The comedic tone was established by the following disclaimer at the end of the opening credits: {{quote}} This was meant to underscore the fact that the actual event portrayed in the movie was, as stated in its Official Entry Regulations, "NOT A RACE."2012 London to Brighton Veteran Car Run  Official Entry Regulations &ndash; Regulation 4.3.4. The story revolves around two Veteran cars and their crews participating in the annual London to Brighton Veteran Car Run. Alan McKim , a young barrister and his wife Wendy , drive Genevieve, a 1904 Darracq. Their friend Ambrose Claverhouse , a brash advertising salesman, his latest girlfriend, fashion model Rosalind Peters  and her pet St. Bernard ride in a 1904 Spyker. The journey to Brighton goes well for Claverhouse, but the McKims' trip is complicated by several breakdowns, and they arrive very late. As Alan cancelled their accommodation in their usual plush hotel during a fit of pique, they are forced to spend the night in a dingy run-down hotel  leaving Wendy feeling less than pleased. They finally join Ambrose and Rosalind for after-dinner drinks, but Rosalind gets very drunk, and insists on playing the trumpet with the house band. She mimes her trumpet solo "Genevieve" to a rendition by jazz trumpeter Kenny Baker, before falling fast asleep moments later, to Wendy's great amusement. Coincidentally, Kay Kendall and Kenny Baker were both born in Withernsea, Yorkshire. Alan and Wendy have an argument over Ambrose's supposed romantic attentions to her, and Alan goes off to the garage to sulk. Whilst working on his car in the middle of the night, Ambrose turns up. Angry words are exchanged and Alan impulsively bets Ambrose one hundred pounds that he can beat Ambrose back to London, despite racing not being allowed by the club. Ambrose accepts the betâ€”"First over Westminster Bridge". The following morning, despite Rosalind's massive hangover and Wendy's determined disapproval of the whole business, the two crews race back to London. Each driver is determined that his car is the better, come what may, and they both resort to various forms of cheating. Ambrose sabotages Alan's engine, and Alan causes Ambrose to be stopped by the police. Finally, on the outskirts of London , both cars are stopped by traffic police and the four contestants are publicly warned after Alan and Ambrose come to blows. At Wendy's insistence, they decide to call off the bet and have a party instead. But whilst waiting for the public house to open, words are exchanged and the bet is on again. The two cars race neck-and-neck through the southern suburbs of London. But with only a few yards to go, Genevieve breaks down. As Ambrose's car is about to overtake it, its tyres become stuck in tramlines  and it drives off in another direction. The brakes on Genevieve fail and the car rolls a few yards onto Westminster Bridge, thus winning the bet.
