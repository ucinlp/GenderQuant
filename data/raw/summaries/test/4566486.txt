The plot of Hell Drivers circles around Joe 'Tom' Yateley  who is an ex-convict. Trying to leave his past behind, he decides to start working for Hawlett's Trucking Company, which transports gravel. Trouble begins when he tries to expose his boss's rackets. Baker's character, Yateley, comes from Blaenllechau in the Rhondda, very close to Baker's own birthplace of Ferndale.
