A group of men commanded by an old one tries to stop an invasion to the city of Aquilea. The invaders are common men who defend the city, ignored by the people in general, but with the development of the film it is understood that the invasion is absolute and impossible to define. The defeat of the defenders is evident from the beginning, as in the "Trojan War".
