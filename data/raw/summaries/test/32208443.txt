On 5 June 1944, commandos are sent to the Channel Islands on sabotage and distraction raids, to draw Hitler's attention away from Normandy. At night, two New Zealand soldiers, Captain Ben Grogan ([[Craig Hall  and Sergeant Joe Tane  paddle in their Klepper canoe to Forau Island, landing on a beach covered in anti-personnel mines and tank traps. They leave the beach and head inland, walking through woods when they hear distant screaming and gunfire. They approach a German fortification and hear what they think is a man being tortured. They climb down into a large gun pit and place explosives on a large artillery gun, but are disturbed when a German soldier  runs out of a tunnel pleading for help. Grogan stabs the soldier in the back of the neck and kills him. They hear a woman screaming, and Grogan decides to investigate with Tane remaining outside. Tane, hearing a gunshot, enters the bunker to investigate. While looking for Grogan, he discovers a book of black magic, and distracted by its contents, is killed by an unseen assailant. Unharmed, Grogan discovers Tane's body and is knocked unconscious by the Nazi. Grogan wakes and is briefly tortured by a Nazi, Colonel Meyer , who wants to know his mission. During the interrogation, a woman is heard screaming from another room. Grogan eventually escapes and chases Meyer into the tunnels, shooting and injuring him. Grogan follows the sound of the woman up to a room covered in occult symbols. He finds a chained woman , who reveals herself to be his dead wife, Helena. Meyer enters the room and shoots Grogan in the leg, then shoots Helena in the head, apparently killing her. Grogan attacks Meyer, who explains the woman is a demon, summoned up from a book of black magic found on the island. Meyer proves this by offering her the leg of a dead German, and as she stops pretending to be dead, changes into her true demon form as she eats the leg. After Grogan removes a bullet from his abdomen, Meyer passes out. Grogan searches him and discovers a page torn from the book of black magic in a small pouch worn as a necklace by the Nazi. Grogan keeps the page after replacing it for another from the book. Soon after Meyer recovers and explains the demon is a shapeshifter and a weapon the Germans plan to use against the Allies. However, they realised the demon poses a world threat, so they keep it confined. Meyer offers to give the book to Grogan if he will help Meyer escape from Germany. Meyer then persuades Grogan to help him perform a ritual to dispel the demon back to Hell. Meyer, believing he is protected with the incantation sheet from the book, betrays Grogan at the end of the ritual. As Meyer reveals his true intent to use the demon for the Nazis, Grogan overpowers Meyer and throws him to the demon. She brutally kills Meyer while Grogan survives, protected by the incantation he has taken from Meyer. Unable to complete the ritual, Grogan takes the book and leaves the demon behind, to prey on any Germans that come to investigate. One does fall prey during the closing credits.
