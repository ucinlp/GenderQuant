So one day, the God decides that Brad's time has come. After an accident at his construction site he is given a new body and identity as Arnold Pischkin. A wisecracking angel from Heaven named Ralph tells him what is going on and explains everything to Brad that he must make up for his sins in order to go to Heaven. Brad now has to get used to his new life without money and good looks. Arnold has to start from the bottom rung of the social ladder and has to resort to being the housekeeper to his widow and son.
