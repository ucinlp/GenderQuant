Pussyfoot is napping on a plush pillow when Claude kicks her off to claim the pillow for himself. Marc Anthony attacks Claude in retaliation, forcing him to return Pussyfoot to her pillow. After this, the conniving Claude schemes to convince Filbert, the animals' stodgy master, that Marc Anthony is trying to eat Pussyfoot. Claude's scheme is successful, and Marc Anthony is thrown out of the house. Claude indulges in his new life without Marc Anthony, taunting the dog by openly abusing Pussyfoot in front of him. Though he remains exiled outside, Marc Anthony manages to find ways to beat up on Claude, eventually eliciting the cat's surrender. Marc Anthony forces Claude to confess to his crimes and, after being vindicated, is let back into the house and back to the side of his beloved Pussyfoot. Claude, meanwhile, is tossed out and is promptly run over by a trolley car. Claude bemoans his bad day before passing out.
