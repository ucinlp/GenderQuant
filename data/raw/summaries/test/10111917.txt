Set in 17th-century Assam, the film recounts the sacrifice of Joymati, a medieval Ahom princess who was tortured and killed by the evil Borphukan for refusing to betray her husband. The event is interpreted in contemporary patriotic terms and calls for a greater harmony between the people of the hills and the plains. The hills are represented by the leader Dalimi, a Naga tribeswoman who shelters the fugitive Prince Gadapani.
