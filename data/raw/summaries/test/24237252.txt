Mickey is operating a steam shovel at a construction site. Minnie appears on a cart pulled by Pluto; she is selling box lunches to the workers for 15Â¢. Mickey accidentally throws dirt from the steam shovel onto Peg-Leg Pete, the foreman, making him angry. Mickey hurriedly brings up a load of bricks in a wheelbarrow, meanwhile Pete sees Minnie and flirts with her. Mickey, distracted by Minnie, accidentally drops the bricks on Pete, who literally shouts out the words "Blankety blank!" Finally Mickey himself falls through Pete's blueprint. Pete has had enough and starts to strangle Mickey, but just then it is noon and an anthropomorphic steam whistle sounds "Lunch!! Lunch!! ..." Mickey settles down to eat a fish sandwich, but it is stolen by Pete. Minnie offers to give him a box lunch for free . As Mickey is eating the lunch, Pete abducts Minnie from above with a crane. Mickey chases after Pete, and finally wrestles with him high up on the building. Minnie grabs a pan of red-hot rivets and drops them down Pete's pants. This gives the mice enough time to run away as Pete pours water down his pants. In the process of chasing Mickey and Minnie, Pete has an anvil fall on his head and fires rivets at them with a handheld pneumatic hammer. This turns on him when the hammer falls into his pants and gets attached to his peg leg. The mice escape down a chute riding a wheelbarrow, while Pete falls into a cement mixer and accidentally dismantles a large portion of the building. At last Pete fires Mickey. But instead he goes into business with Minnie selling box lunches.
