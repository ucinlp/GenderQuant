Relatively void of plot, the short depicts Bosko hosting a movie show, playing a "Furtilizer" organ , leading the audience in the song "We're in the Money". He goes on to introduce a mock newsreel which features caricatures of the Marx Brothers chasing a dog in a dog race, as well as a sequence depicting Adolf Hitler pursuing Jimmy Durante with a meat cleaver in hand, possibly the first time Hitler was depicted in an animated cartoon. It is followed by a short subject parodying Laurel and Hardy who are called "Haurel and Lardy" starring in "Spite of Everything". The climax of the movie is a burlesque melodrama in which a stereotypical villain chases Bosko's girlfriend, Honey who was initially serenaded in the melodrama by the Marx Brothers.
