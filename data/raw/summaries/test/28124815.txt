After her mother's death, New York City fashion designer Lisa Rayborn  returns to her hometown and family farm. Due to a weak economy, her brother Jim  has converted the family business from a cattle farm into a sheep farm, despite their father's  objections. To help out, Lisa decides she will stay to help on the farm. She adopts a border collie from the local animal shelter and trains it as a sheepdog, naming the dog Lucky. Jim and Lisa decide to enter Lucky in a sheep herding contest, but when a severe thunderstorm sparks a forest fire, Lucky helps rescue trapped children and bring them to safety. While doing so, Lucky's leg is burned, and it looks as if she will not be able to compete.
