Ambassador-designate to Saudi Arabia Ogden Mears  sails back to America after touring the world. He meets Natasha, a Russian countess , in Hong Kong after she sneaks aboard to escape being forced into prostitution. She has no passport and is forced to stay in his cabin during the voyage. Ogden dislikes the situation, being a married man, although partially separated, and worries how it might affect his career if she is found. But he reluctantly agrees to let her stay. They then have to figure out a way to get her off the ship, and it is arranged that she marry his aged valet, Hudson . Although it is only a formality, Hudson wishes to consummate the relationship, which a wish she does not share. Natasha avoids him and, before docking at port, jumps off the ship and swims ashore. Ogden's wife  then joins the cruise, having just missed her. Ogden's lawyer friend Harvey , who helped arrange the marriage, meets Natasha and tells her that the immigration officers have accepted her as Hudson's wife. Ogden's wife then confronts him about Natasha, speaking rather roughly about her and the life she led. He then asks if his wife would have done as well under such circumstances. The film ends with Ogden and Natasha meeting in a hotel's cabaret, where they begin dancing, since he has left the cruise and his wife behind. Charlie Chaplin makes two brief appearances as the ship's steward.
