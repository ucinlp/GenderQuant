During a storm, Tom is trying to find a place to stay after being thrown out of a horse drawn wagon. In the meantime, Jerry is assisting a mad scientist in a castle. They take an orange cat (while not identified by name, he appears to be [[Lightning  and strap him to a table next to a dog (presumably [[Spike and Tyke  that is strapped to another table. The mad scientist and Jerry push a number of buttons and controls to switch the brains of the cat and dog, that is, Lightning now has a dog's brain and vice versa. The mad scientist gives the "cat" to Jerry as a companion. While they are sleeping, Tom approaches the castle, noticing Jerry. Lightning  growls and threatens Tom. Tom tries to convince Lightning that he's a cat, but fails. Over the next few minutes, Tom's efforts to catch Jerry are thwarted by Lightning. As Tom runs off in fright, he comes into contact with other animals that the mad scientist has experimented on, including a chirping elephant, a chicken that baas like a lamb, a mooing cuckoo-bird, Spike whose brain was switched with the cat, and Jerry, who roars rather like the MGM lion, Leo, complete with the trademark ribbon that reads "Ars Gratia Artis" , the official motto for the company. Tom blasts off like a rocket and is never seen again in the cartoon  while Jerry winks at the camera as the cartoon closes.Tom & Jerry: The Definitive Guide to their Animated Adventures, Patrick Brion; New York; Harmony Books, p.34
