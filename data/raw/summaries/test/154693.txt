It tells the story of a group of wounded Allied soldiers in a mobile surgery unit at the end of World War II who, after initial resentment and ostracism, rally around a loner, a heretofore surly, unappreciative Scot when they find out he is dying. The film stars Ronald Reagan as the American, Patricia Neal as the harried nurse, Sister Margaret Parker, Richard Todd as Lachie, the Scot, Anthony Nicholls as the hospital commander, Howard Marion-Crawford as the British soldier, John Sherman as the Australian, and Orlando Martins as the African .
