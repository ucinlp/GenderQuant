The confusion begins when Lucky  is released from prison and tries to lead a respectable life despite his troubled past. Lucky once or twice reflects on the wisdom of his grandfather who supposedly told him "sometimes without bad luck, it would seem you don't have any luck at all." This theme is supposed to be manifested throughout the film. Shortly after his release from prison, Lucky tries to get back on his feet but inexplicably ends up a victim of Hurricane Katrina's wrath, and loses his newly found life. After moving back to New York, Lucky is dealt another blow when the government withdraws funds for his yoga and samba dance classes which he uses to try to keep kids off of the streets. This unfortunate event leads to Lucky enduring the bad influences of two old friends from his past life as a criminal, who lure Lucky to a strip club under the false pretense of a friend's birthday. When a drug deal with some dangerous mobsters goes bad, Lucky is now on the run with a feisty Puerto Rican stripper from the strip club, Angie , and over $500,000 in American currency, which is wired with marking dye. Throughout the film, there are short cuts of an unconventional and troubled couple, unexplained and known to the police as the "Sawtooth Killers." James Hiroyuki Liao plays Chang, an egotistical and maniacal accomplice to Cass, played by Cybill Shepherd, a mother of a mentally challenged man named Eugene . Motivated by Cass's son's unpleasant experiences with society's rejection of mentally challenged individuals, the couple brutally kidnaps, tortures, and presumably kills their abductees, recording their exploits on video, possibly for future viewing. These two stories merge at the end as Angie and Lucky find themselves caught up in the path of violence, and Lucky ends up an unlikely hero by saving the life of a would-be victim of the Sawtooth Killers. The film culminates with Lucky saving the police officer played by Van Peebles, from Cass's son Eugene who is armed with a shovel. Lucky, choosing to have a positive outlook on the events by using perspective gained from his grandfather, characterizes the events as being "the luckiest day in an unlucky man's life." Lucky and Angie go on to receive a $200,000 reward which had been offered by the police for information leading the capture, arrest, and/or prosecution of the Sawtooth Killers.
