While making a movie on the French Riviera, the producer Max Poulton has been having an affair with his star, Gina Bertini. A married man, Max does not want to lose his wife Carol, but the hot-tempered Gina threatens to tell all. Max comes home with a blood stain on his shirt cuff. A visit follows from an Inspector Carliss of Scotland Yard, who says Gina's body has just been found, stabbed to death. Rushing to the house where he and Gina used to secretly meet, Max gathers up possessions he's left behind. A neighbor spots his car. Upon returning home, to a party Carol is hosting, Max is astounded to find Gina alive and well among the guests. Confused, he drives her home, leaves her in the car briefly, then returns to find her lifeless body, once again stabbed. Max thinks he must be losing his mind. This time a local police official, Inspector Simon, comes to call. The only conclusion Max can draw is that Carliss is somehow trying to frame him. His suspicions are correct. Carliss is not a Scotland Yard inspector at all but Gina's jealous ex-husband. He has arranged things to make Max appear guilty, and Simon, having the neighbor's eyewitness description of seeing Max's car, has little choice but to place Max under arrest. When it looks as though Carliss intends to harm Carol as well, Max escapes from jail. He manipulates Carliss into stealing his own car, and when the police give chase to the wrong man, Carliss, in a panic, drives over a cliff. Max's innocence becomes apparent to the police.
