Pooja, an orphan, is brought up in a brickyard with her grandfather. She is excellent in her studies and co curricular activities. The owner of the brickyard takes her to his city house for higher studies but his wife engages Pooja as a domestic hand and does not allow her to go to school. A strong bond develops between her spoilt daughter, Mickey and Pooja. Within a short time Pooja transforms Mickey into an all round champion. When the friendship reaches a peak level, Pooja is driven out from their house. Years later these two tender hearts meet: Mickey with eye injury and Pooja to Pooja her without revealing her identity. Mickey’s condition aggravates and Pooja prays almighty for Mickey at the cost of her life. Pooja dies and Mickey sees the light of the world through Pooja’s eyes. http://gadadharputy.blogspot.com/
