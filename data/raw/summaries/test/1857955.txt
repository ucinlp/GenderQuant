Mario Beretti is a young Italian-American philanderer, who has migrated to New York City. He is also a Barber. He runs a Barber Shop by a construction site that boasts few customers. His life reaches a turning point when he is notified of the death of his aunt living in England, who named him her sole heir. Mario rushes to England, and learns that his inheritance consists of thirteen antique chairs. He sells them in order to cover his transportation costs, but soon learns from his aunt's last message, that inside one of the chairs is a fortune in jewels. He tries to buy back the chairs but is unsuccessful in doing so. With the help of a lovely antiques dealer living in London named Pat, the two then set out on a bizarre quest to track down the chairs that takes them from London to Rome. Along the way, they meet a bunch of equally bizarre characters such as a driver of a furniture moving van named Albert; a prostitute named Judy; Maurice, the leader of a traveling theater company that stages a poor version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; the Italian entrepreneur Carlo Di Seta; and his vivacious daughter Stefanella. The bizarre chase ends in Rome, where the chair containing the money finds its way into a truck, and is collected by nuns who auction it off to charity. With nothing much left to do as a result of the failure in his quest, Mario travels back to New York City by ship, as Pat sees him off and waves goodbye to him. The film ends with Mario returning to New York City, and to his Barber Shop. His friends over at the other  shop join him, as do two construction workers, and his last customer Randomhouse. It is there that Mario makes a strange discovery: Shortly before his departure for Europe, he invented a way to make hair regrow miraculously. He then laughs evilly over his discovery.
