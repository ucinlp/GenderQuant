Woody is a piano player at the Old Crow Bar where a beautiful Brazilian woman wearing a red dress and a big green sombrero sits atop his piano. Word of Buzz Buzzard coming to town looking to kill the sheriff spreads and every sheriff at the Bar gives Woody their badges. The woman still sitting on the piano then takes Woody in her arms and says, "Es mi hombre magnifico. You are my little sheriff. You will get the bad hombre, no?" Then she gives him a big kiss, convincing him to stop Buzz.
