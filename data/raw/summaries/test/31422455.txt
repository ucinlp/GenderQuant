Kumar Patel  prepares for the holidays by visiting Santa Claus at a shopping mall. Later, the same Santa  sells him cannabis in the mall's parking garage. Since being dumped by Vanessa , Kumar has let himself go; he has not become a doctor since failing a drug test, and still lives in the messy apartment that he once shared with Harold Lee , who has become a successful businessman on Wall Street. Harold's assistant, Kenneth , persuades him to buy a 3D television as a gift for Harold's father-in-law. As Harold and Kenneth leave the building, they are attacked by protestors who throw eggs at them. Vanessa visits Kumar and tells him that she is pregnant with his child, shocking him. The two get into an argument and Vanessa leaves. After arriving home, Harold is seduced by his wife Maria , but their attempt to conceive is interrupted by the arrival of her father , who dislikes Harold. He explains to Harold that he has never had a perfect Christmas, and is counting on Harold to make this one the best for his daughter. He has brought a tree that he has grown for eight years and deemed the perfect Christmas tree. When a package addressed to Harold arrives at Kumar's apartment, Kumar decides to deliver it to Harold. The package turns out to be a large marijuana joint that Kumar cannot resist smoking. Since Harold has gotten married and does not get high anymore, he throws the lit joint out of the window and it 'magically' flies back into another window and lands on the tree, causing a fire that destroys it. To replace it, Harold reserves one of the last Christmas trees available at a nearby lot. Kumar, feeling bad that he may have ruined Christmas for Harold, decides to purchase a replacement tree, and bribes the tree lot into selling him the tree that Harold reserved. When Harold sees the car with the tree drive away, he pursues it, and the car with Kumar's tree crashes and explodes on the highway, destroying the tree. Harold argues with Kumar before they introduce each other to their new friends. Harold, Kumar, Todd, Adrian along with Todd's daughter drive to a party in New York to retrieve a Christmas tree at Adrian's partner's party. Things take a turn for the worse, and Harold and Kumar ultimately end up participating in a Christmas show featuring Neil Patrick Harris, hoping he can help them get a tree. After a wild night of performing on Broadway, getting kidnapped by Ukrainian gangsters, accidentally shooting Santa Claus  and performing emergency surgery on him, Harold invites Kumar to his Christmas party the following day. That evening, Kumar sneaks through Vanessa's window and states that he will stop smoking weed for the sake of her baby and will re-take the exams to become a doctor. Harold returns to Maria's house with her father waiting on the couch. The two argue until Harold explains he might not be the perfect son-in-law, but he is the perfect man for Maria. Maria's father reveals that while he always knew Harold was a nice guy, he wanted to make sure he had some "cojones" before accepting him into the Perez Family. Harold and Kumar celebrate Christmas together along with their families.
