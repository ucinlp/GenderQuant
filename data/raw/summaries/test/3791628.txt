 Cantinflas is the boyfriend of Paz, the maid of the household of Cayetano Lastre. It is dinnertime and Cantinflas waits outside the mansion for Paz's whistle: a sign for Cantinflas to enter the kitchen to eat. This is because there is a dog in the front yard named "Bobby", and Paz's boss does not know about Cantinflas' entrances into the house. Although like other times Cantinflas goes straight to eat, this time his girlfriend has one favor for him to do, that of killing the dog "Bobby" who has had a sudden attack of rabies and does not let Cayetano leave for an appointment. If he does not kill the dog, he does not get to eat. Cantinflas is nervous about the idea, but eventually kills him with a gun. However, inside the house, Cayetano plans a scheme to unfoil his wife Dolores del Paso's "supposed" adultery with her ex-boyfriend Bobby Lechuga. Dolores does not hold a relationship with Bobby Lechuga, but Cayetano's over-bearing jealousy makes him think otherwise.
