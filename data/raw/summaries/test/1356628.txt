Directed by Roger Vadim as a modern  adaptation of the once scandalous French novel, it pits one woman's desire to manipulate others against the power of real love. Jeanne Moreau plays Juliette de Merteuil, a conniving socialite who manipulates the Vicomte de Valmont  into meeting and seducing Marianne . Valmont and Marianne fall in love much to his dismay and to the delight of Merteuil. Shot in black and white in the style of the French New Wave  Vadim's whirlwind portrayal of Merteuil and Valmont's deceitful dealings brings together a clash of late 1950s society and 18th-century morality.
