{{Unreferenced section}} On the first day of high school, best friends Virgil Fox , Derek Beaugard  and Stephanie Jameson  decide to begin their paths by trying out for various activities. While Derek tries for the football team and Stephanie begins cheerleading, Virgil's high school career takes a bad turn. Charlie Tuttle , a genius who skipped many grades, rockets onto the field on a rocket-propelled car, losing control until Derek throws a football at him and knocks him off. Virgil defends Charlie while Derek just sits by. Virgil and Charlie are forced to dress as cheerleaders and are hung on the school mascot's, a bighorn sheep, horns. Three years later, senior year, Virgil and Charlie are still outcasts. Charlie informs Virgil that he has brilliantly invented a time machine. Unaware of how to build the time machine, the duo recruits Zeke . When the time machine is built, Virgil, still regretting the first day of high school, decides that he would like to use the machine to undo embarrassing mistakes made by their classmates. They test the time machine out by buying a winning lottery ticket. Jeanette  helps the trio save outcasts from social embarrassment by providing them with white snowsuits to wear and handles the machine while the boys are time-traveling. The school's vice-principal  attempts to stop the "Snowsuit Guys", the name everybody knows them by. After the "Snowsuit Guys" are named local heroes, they save Stephanie from falling off her cheerleader's pyramid. Realizing that the hero was Virgil, Stephanie confronts Virgil and he is finally allowed to hang out with the popular kids. The time machine eventually begins to cause terrible consequences, however. The outcasts have become popular and have let it go to their heads. Virgil abandons Charlie and Zeke. Meanwhile, Stephanie learns that Derek is cheating on her and Derek falsely befriends Virgil to get him to change everything with the time machine. The FBI arrives in the town after monitoring suspicious activity. Virgil and Zeke learn that Charlie had stolen the time machine blueprints from the NASA mainframe. After consulting with the government's top scientists, Charlie learns that the time machine has created a black hole. With only hours to live, the trio decide to go into the hole and close it. Once they have entered the black hole, they are transported back to their first day of high school. Virgil realizes that he can undo the events that caused him to lose his popularity. When he arrives at the field he sees that Derek didn't try to stop the bullies but actually suggested dressing Virgil and Charlie up as cheerleaders. Charlie informs Virgil that the incident gave him a best friend, and without it they Virgil, Zeke and Charlie wouldn't have become friends. They manage to close the black hole and return to the day when they first tried time-traveling. Everything goes back to normal and Virgil confesses his feelings towards Stephanie . Virgil confronts Derek and realizes that Derek will always be a jerk. As Virgil and Stephanie embrace, Charlie walks up to them and eagerly suggests a new idea: Teleportation, but Virgil and Zeke drag him off, and the credits roll.
