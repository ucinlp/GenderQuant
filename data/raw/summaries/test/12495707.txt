Lee Umstetter  is in San Quentin for armed robbery serving "life without possibility" -- that is, with no chance of parole. After two failed suicide attempts, Lee begins to read books from the prison library. He attends a performance of Waiting for Godot given for the prisoners and is deeply moved. He begins to write plays about imprisonment and then stages them, too. One is a social-protest musical extravaganza about life in the penitentiary, which attracts visitors and earns Lee the regard of a San Francisco theatre reviewer  who persuades the governor to release him. Lee organises an acting troupe made up of former cons -- a shoplifter ([[William Forsythe , a murderer , an embezzler , a smart pimp , a flasher , and others. Lee's work doesn't make the same impact outside the prison as it did inside. Touring in a camper, with no money, the men are torn by impulses to revert to their former criminal behaviour.
