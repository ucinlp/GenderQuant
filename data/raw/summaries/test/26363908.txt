Grace Hayes, as herself essentially, Grace Hayes, has been content to play the vaudeville circuit, and support her son, and the wealthy family who shunned her. Tired of the road, she goes to visit her son, played by her real-life son Peter Lind Hayes, as Peter Kendricks, with her personal assistant, played by her real-life daughter-in-law, Mary Healy, as Mary Healy, in cognitohttp://www.thefreedictionary.com/Incognito+. Once there, she finds her son and the college “going to Hell in a hand basket” despite the earnest efforts of the kind hearted Dean, Richard "Skeets" Gallagher, as Professor Warren. The college and the old families are running out of money and spirit. Grace buys the local diner, turns it into a version of her real-life club, encouraging the kids to give it the old college try, and put on a show to raise the funds and spirit the college needs to survive. It doesn’t take long, with a little elbow grease, for the kids’ heart to shine through. The question remains whether the college will survive, or if the Dean, Peter and the kids will be joining Grace and Mary on the road.
