In 1880, men from three Kansas towns feud over which one gets to be the state's county seat. A safe containing important documents will be placed in whichever town is the winner. To the frustration of the women back home, then men go away for long periods of time to fight, then return home exhausted. Matt Davis wants to marry Sheriff McClure's attractive daughter Liza, but neither McClure is sure if Matt's more interested in the town or romance. Liza is livid when, just as they marry, Matt leaves again because the safe's been stolen. He forms a posse and the other men take off with him. All of the women, including young Birdie and spinster Cassie, decide to join Liza in going "on strike" against the men, holing up in a fort and locking them out. The men must prove they are worthy before the women will agree to take them back.
