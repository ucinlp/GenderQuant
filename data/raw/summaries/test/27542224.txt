It is winter once again in the Evergreen Forest, home of the frozen Evergreen lake, where everyone in the forest goes to ice skate and play hockey. Schaeffer, the old sheepdog, goes down to the lake, where he and his friends The Raccoons  go to play a round of hockey. Cedrc Sneer is also at the rink, too, where he meets Sophia Tutu, a female aardvark figure skater who takes an interest in Cedric. Meanwhile, Cyril Sneer has plans for Evergreen Lake - he plans on building his 'Cyril Dome' over the entire lake. But as Cyril and his construction crew are ready to build, the Raccoons and their friends stop them in their tracks and try to defend their lake. Bert then steps in and proposes that the two warring sides should play a hockey game to determine who gets the lake. Before Bert's friends try to stop him, Bert and Cyril seal the deal. While Cyril trains his Bears for the game, the Raccoons ask Cedric to play on their side. Cedric agrees, as long as he can get away from his father, who disapproves of Cedric's friendship with the Raccoons. As they train, Cedric is shown to be a great hockey player and the team feel like they have a good chance against Cyril's team, but Cyril goes to spy on the Raccoons and he is immediately not happy with his son siding with the Raccoons. He grounds Cedric for a month and he also forbids Cedric from seeing Sophia  ever again. Despite the setback, the Raccoons and Schaeffer continue to practice. On the night before the game, the friends decide to sneak into Cyril Sneer's mansion to ask Cedric if he will play alongside them. However, Cedric is more concerned for their safety and warns them of what could happen if Cyril finds them. A moment later, they are almost caught by Cyril, who claims he can hear other voices and angrily threatens his son not to go anywhere near the Raccoons again. Because of this, Cedric becomes too scared and the friends leave without his backing. On the night of the game, Cyril's Bears are pummelling the Raccoons team by 3-0. After Bert injures his hand, Sophia finally goes up to Cedric, who has been dragged along to watch the game, and convinces him to help out. Masquerading as a "mystery player", Cedric manages to tie the game 3-3. Cyril finds out who the mystery player is, literally kicking his own son off the ice and threatening to lock him in the dungeon as a punishment. The team considers giving up, but despite his injury, Bert refuses to give up so easily. The rest of the team are spurred on by Bert's courage and they go back onto the ice to continue. Bert manages to win the game for the team in the last few seconds, thus saving Evergreen Lake from Cyril's greed. The next day, Julie, Tommy and their father arrive at the lake and find skate marks from the game. They're utterly puzzled as to who left them, as the humans were never aware of the threat posed to the lake, leaving Dan to curiously ask the kids if they've "been playing any wild hockey games" lately.
