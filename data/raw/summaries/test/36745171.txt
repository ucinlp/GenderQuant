An unnamed narrator , who as a teenager intended to be the "Michael Jordan of sex" or "Wayne Gretzky with a hard-on",{{sfn}} discusses how he met and fell in love with an older man named Frank, whom he met at a group sex session. The two began an older brother–younger brother fantasy and moved in together. Frank has a voracious sexual appetite and, at times, invites the narrator for whole-day sex sessions. He is a tender lover, teaching his partner how to fly a box kite and cooking omelettes for him. In turn, the narrator is pleased with Frank's attentions and their sexual experimentation, although he is initially confused by Frank's insistence on listening to Peter Gzowski's Morningside during sex. As their ten-year anniversary approaches, Frank&nbsp;– having lost large amounts of weight and developed Kaposi's sarcomas&nbsp;– has been diagnosed with AIDS, leaving the narrator stunned; he concludes the narration with "I'm going to miss him. He was the best friend I ever had."{{sfn}}
