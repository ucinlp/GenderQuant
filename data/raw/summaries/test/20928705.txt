The film begins in a meeting on August 2002 where a social activist, Simon Petrov, is reading the sentence dictated by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ordering the Venezuelan state to compensate to the relatives of the victims of the 27 February 1989 riots. The people at that meeting began to tell and remember the tragic moments of that event.
