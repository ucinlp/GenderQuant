The movie revolves around Jamal , a 10 year old Pakistani Muslim boy. While playing cricket near the Indo Pakistani border, the cricket ball is tossed over to the Indian side of the border separated by a fence. Jamal crosses the fence to fetch the ball. He is however spotted by the Indian security forces and shot at. He hides in an Indian village where he is provided shelter by Bhola , a devout Hindu Brahmin. Both Bhola and his niece, Rani , are sceptical about allowing a Muslim boy in their home. However, when the security forces come looking for Jamal in the village, he is protected by Bhola and Rani. Jamal does manage to return to Pakistan in the end.
