Young filmmaker and scientist Victor Frankenstein lives with his parents and dog Sparky in the quiet town of New Holland. Concerned with his son's isolation, Victor's father encourages him to take up baseball and make achievements outside of science. Victor hits a home run at his first game, but Sparky, pursuing the ball, is killed by a car. Inspired by his science teacher Mr. Rzykruski's demonstration of the effect of electricity on dead frogs, a depressed Victor digs up Sparky's corpse, brings him to his makeshift laboratory in the attic, and successfully reanimates him with lightning. Seeing a cat, the undead Sparky escapes from the attic and explores the neighborhood. He is recognized by Victor's hunchbacked classmate Edgar Gore, who blackmails Victor into teaching him how to raise the dead. The two reanimate a dead goldfish, which turns invisible due to an error with the experiment. Edgar brags about the undead fish to their other classmates—Nassor, Toshiaki, Bob, and a girl nicknamed "Weird Girl"—sparking their own interest in reanimation so they can show off their resurrected pets at the town science fair. Victor's parents discover Sparky in the attic and are frightened, causing the dog to flee. Victor and his parents search for Sparky while the classmates invade the lab, discovering Victor's reanimation formula. The classmates separately perform their experiments, which go awry and turn the dead animals into monsters—Weird Girl's living cat Mr. Whiskers holds a dead bat while it is electrocuted, turning him into a vampire cat; Edgar turns a dead rat he found in the garbage into a wererat; Nassor revives his mummified hamster Colossus; Toshiaki's turtle Shelley is covered in a growth formula and turns into a giant Gamera-like monster; and Bob's Sea-Monkeys grow into amphibious humanoid monsters. The monsters break loose into the town fair where they wreak havoc. After finding Sparky at the town cemetery, Victor sees the monsters attacking the fair and goes to help his classmates deal with them—-the Sea-Monkeys explode after eating salt-covered popcorn, and Colossus is stepped on by Shelley, while the rat and Shelley are returned to their original, deceased forms after being electrocuted. During the chaos, the town mayor's niece Elsa van Helsing, who is also Victor's crush, is grabbed by Mr. Whiskers and carried to the town windmill. The townsfolk blame Sparky for her disappearance and chase him to the windmill, which the mayor accidentally ignites with his torch. Victor and Sparky enter the burning windmill and rescue Elsa, but Victor is trapped inside. Sparky rescues Victor, only to be dragged back inside by Mr. Whiskers. Both pets are killed when the windmill collapses. To reward Sparky for his bravery, the townsfolk gather to revive Sparky with their car batteries, reanimating him once more.
