The Specials tells the story of a day in the life of a ragtag group of misfit superheroes. The Specials are decent as far as superhero teams go, but they never rise in either popularity or prestige because of their "indie" status. Unlike other super teams, the heroes are not corporation-friendly and have since struck out in creating a merchandising deal. Without the corporate or private financial resources of more well established teams, the Specials often get underrated villains, small disasters, and the occasional alien invasion to repel--all of which are deemed too low-priority for their peers. Even the members with decent powers have shortcomings that have thus prevented a transition for the team as a whole. The Strobe, Ms. Indestructible, The Weevil, Deadly Girl, Power Chick, Amok, Alien Orphan, and Eight all have decent, useful powers by all accounts, but since they all possess various social dysfunctions, they've never quite broken through the superhero glass ceiling. The day begins with the welcoming of Nightbird , the group's newest member – a teenage girl with "bird powers." Nightbird – who idolizes The Specials – soon realizes that her heroes do not function as a harmonious team. Like their reputation as a group of misfits, they act like a dysfunctional family at times. One of the two greatest points of stress in the team is the slowly fracturing relationship between the Strobe and Ms. Indestructible, who are both the core of the team and a married couple. The second is the Weevil, who is trying to negotiate an exit into a more high-profile superhero team playing both on his own popularity and his legacy status from following in his father's footsteps. The cracks begin to show as they prepare to attend a dinner in their honor thrown by Kosgrov Toys, who are releasing a line of action figures based upon the group. The event is a travesty. It becomes quickly apparent that Kosgrov did little research on the Specials, and low-balled the production by utilizing cheap accessories and recycled parts. Worse yet, the leader of the Specials, The Strobe , discovers that his wife, Ms. Indestructible , is cheating on him with the most popular member of the group, The Weevil . In a fit of anger, the Strobe disbands the group, and the members go their own ways. The Strobe goes to Zip Boy's  house and asks for a job at New Standard's Inc, a plastics company in Detroit, denying there's a problem by saying that he's great, now that he has "a great new job as a welding asshole." Ms. Indestructible spends the night watching her old wedding video and crying over a glass of wine. The Strobe's brother, Minute Man ([[James Gunn , who had had a crush on the new girl, Nightbird, ultimately falls into the arms of Deadly Girl , who was hurt to learn about Weevil and Ms. Indestructible. Meanwhile, Amok , Power Chick , Alien Orphan , and Mr. Smart  indulge in a night of drinking and dancing. During the disbandment, the Weevil finalizes his transfer to another superhero team, only to find that his negative press from the Specials still follows him. Reporters focus more on his controversy than his ability to apprehend villains, and the Weevil generally finds that he has gone from being the top dog in a small team to the team runt in the larger one. The Strobe and Ms. Indestructible do manage to reconcile, and the Strobe renews his passion for justice instead of image. When the team comes back together, they are immediately called back into action and resolve to do what they've always done: the right thing. Not because it will bring them popularity or glory, but because as misfits, they've become the champions of the underdogs, the forgotten, and the outcasts of society. In the superhero community, the Specials have no one to turn to but each other, and when the downtrodden of the world need help from superheroes, they turn to the Specials. Resolving that while there may be no glory in it, there is nobility, the team exits to face down another crisis.
