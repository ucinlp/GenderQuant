The film's opening explains that in 1994 a web series called Murder, which showed footage of actual deaths and acts of violence, appeared. After being active for four months, Murder was shut down by the authorities and all its content confiscated, though the host, a man simply known as Balan, evaded capture and identification. Now, years later, Balan has reemerged to show off more footage he has collected, and offer commentary on people's obsession with death, the effect it has on them, and how accessible new media has made it. The series of videos is kicked off by Balan stating, "I ask you all... Why are you watching? Are you trying to find reality? Do you feel the need to be shocked? To witness something that human eyes shouldn't see? Murder is reality. Death comes when you least expect it. With what you are about to observe, you may question your own integrity. You will ask, could this happen to me? My answer to you is... Yes it can." * Bludgeoning: A drunk Russian man unintentionally beats his teenage son to death in front of the son's running webcam. * The Heist: A restaurant is robbed by a quartet of gunmen, who shoot a cashier in the head and a fleeing customer in the back, all of it caught by the security system. * The Cheat: In front of a stationary camera, a man reminisces about how he met his wife, and about all the good times they shared, while a monitor in the background shows his wife having sex with someone else. The man leaves the room, and the monitor shows him barging in on his wife and her lover, hacking the former to death with an axe, and cutting out her heart, which the wife had once said would always belong to him. * S&G: A parking lot security camera catches two people attacking a couple, beating the man with a baseball bat, and abducting the woman. * Broadway Rob: The distorted home movie of a pedophile who forces his latest victims, two gagged boys clad only in their socks and underwear, to dance with him. One of the boys manages to overpower the pedophile, strangling him with his bonds, and stabbing him over and over again with a knife. * Execution: A muffled black and white camcorder video of a hooded and masked group  executing a man via decapitation in front of a woman, who they taunt with the severed head before shooting her. * ATM: A man is mugged and killed at an ATM. * Autopsy: Japanese autopsy footage of a woman who was shot in the mouth, the bullet exiting the top of her skull. The coroner eventually grows annoyed by the antics of the cameraman, and kicks him out of the room. * Bullied: A trio of drunks use a camcorder to record themselves taking a man out to the woods, under the pretense of initiating him into their group. The three bully and humiliate the man, and during a scuffle, one of them accidentally knocks him onto the knife another was holding. The three panic and bicker, and the camera is dropped when a violent fight breaks out over whether they should go to the police. * Homecoming: A building security camera records two figures garroting a man. * Ransom: A severely deteriorated series of ransom videos show three men torturing a woman while making their demands. Much to the annoyance of her captors, the woman eventually dies due to the severity of her injuries. After the last clip, Balan delivers the closing statement, "You realize now it's everywhere. Death casts a shadow on all our faces. The new media shines light on dank crevasses, revealing moral decay and broken experiences that are better left beyond the pale. Goosebumps explode on my skin with every clip we watch. I feel it now more than ever. How do you feel?"
