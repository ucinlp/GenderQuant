This is Kirk Cameron's partial description on the film's website: I’m retracing the footsteps of our Founders from England to America in the hope of discovering our true “national treasure.” I want to listen to them, to learn from them. Because I suspect Forefathers knew we were a forgetful people, that someday we would lose our way as a nation. So they left us a map that would guide us back to the source of America’s success. I've already completed the first part of my trip, and I’m happy to say, my hunch was right! What I've discovered already is amazing! The key to transforming our nation and securing our children's future is not complicated. Best of all, it’s not hidden away like something out of the Da Vinci Code. It's been right in front of us all along, and I can’t wait to show it to you in this film. Cameron asserts that such a &#34;key&#34; is manifest in the National Monument to the Forefathers in Plymouth, Massachusetts, which is a large statue commemorating the Mayflower Pilgrims. Co-writer Marshall Foster ascribes to this statue the contextual validity of Monumental's message, based on the statue's symbolism and engraved dedication. According to Foster, &#34;The monument depicts Faith, and Faith is pointing to God and has an open Geneva Bible in the right hand and a star of wisdom&#34;. {{cite web}}
