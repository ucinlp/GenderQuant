Snoopy is beginning to get into constant mischief, angering the other children in Charlie Brown's neighborhood. They demand that Charlie Brown do something about it "Because he's your dog, Charlie Brown!" Charlie Brown then writes a letter to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm, asking them to take Snoopy back and teach him some manners. Snoopy tries pulling sick looks to get out of his punishment, but Charlie Brown tells him it is for his own good. Charlie Brown decides to call Peppermint Patty to ask if she will house Snoopy for a day, as the trip to the farm is too long to take in a single day. Peppermint Patty agrees. When Snoopy arrives at Peppermint Patty's house, he sees he has as an opportunity to avoid going to obedience school and decides to stay at the girl's house instead. This angers Peppermint Patty, as she begins to get tired of bringing him root beer, and cleaning up his mess, while Snoopy enjoys her swimming pool. A week later, Charlie Brown receives a phone call from the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm, telling him that Snoopy never arrived there. Charlie Brown soon finds out that the dog has been staying at Peppermint Patty's for a week. He brings a leash, in hopes he will bring Snoopy home. He attaches the leash to Snoopy's collar but the dog escapes and rushes back to Peppermint Patty's house. However, instead of returning to the easy life he enjoyed before, Peppermint Patty makes the dog become her maid. Later, when his friends start to miss Snoopy, Charlie Brown tries to bring the dog back again, but because he brings the leash, Snoopy just breaks it and refuses to leave. Later, while cleaning the dishes, Snoopy becomes infuriated with his chores, and in anger, he breaks all the dishes. However, Peppermint Patty sends him to the garage in anger as punishment. While in the garage, Snoopy realizes that being with Charlie Brown is the better choice. He escapes from Peppermint Patty's house and returns home. Overjoyed, Charlie Brown welcomes him back, with hopes that everyone will be glad to see him. The next day, after taking Linus on a wild ride and unintentionally fighting Lucy, Snoopy goes to his dog house, greatly contented that he is finally home.
