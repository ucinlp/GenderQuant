 Evelyn Salt  is tortured in a North Korean prison on suspicion of being an American spy. Released as part of a prisoner exchange, she is met by Central Intelligence Agency  colleague Ted Winter . When she wonders why she has been freed , Winter informs her that the dogged persistence of her boyfriend, renowned arachnologist Michael Krause , forced the agency to act. Salt admits to Michael that she is a spy and warns him that he "is not safe with her." He, however, tells her he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. Two years later, on Salt's wedding anniversary, a Russian defector named Oleg Vasilyevich Orlov  arrives at the CIA. Salt interrogates him, with Winter and CIA counterintelligence agent Peabody  observing. Orlov tells her about "Day X", a Russian plot to destroy the United States by using English-speaking sleeper agents trained from childhood. Agent "KA-12" will assassinate Russian President Boris Matveyev , a reformer who has dedicated his time in office to improve relations between Russia and the United States, at the funeral of the Vice President of the United States. Orlov reveals that KA-12 is named "Evelyn Salt". Salt protests her innocence and insists on calling her husband to warn him, but he does not answer. Winter reluctantly agrees when Peabody decides to detain Salt, but she escapes and makes her way back to her apartment. Finding signs that Michael has been kidnapped, Salt takes her weapons and one of Michael's spiders. After evading CIA pursuit after a series of escapes, Salt travels to New York City and checks into a hotel, where she extracts venom from the spider. Salt makes her way to the church where the funeral is being held. Despite the tight security, she gets in and sets off a demolition charge during the Vice President's eulogy, causing Matveyev to fall through the floor to where Salt is waiting to complete the assassination. Peabody captures her, but she escapes on the way to custody. The media report that the Russian president is dead en route to hospital. On her way to the barge where Orlov is holed up with other KAs, Salt remembers, in a series of flashbacks, growing up in the Soviet Union, where her mentor Orlov trained her and other children to obey him absolutely and how she became the sleeper agent KA-12. Orlov tests her loyalty to him by having Michael killed in front of her. She seemingly shows no emotion. Satisfied, he then briefs her on the next part of her mission: she is to rendezvous with another sleeper agent, who will help her eliminate the President of the United States. Enraged at the death of Michael and wanting to stop the plot, Salt then kills Orlov and all the other agents there. Salt meets fellow KA agent Shnaider , who uses his cover identity as a Czech NATO liaison to get Salt, disguised as his aide, into the White House. Shnaider then launches a suicidal attack, causing the Secret Service and Winter to move the President to an underground bunker. After a series of hand-to-hand battles, Salt manages to get inside. In the main room, the president  and another man together give the activation code for the country's nuclear arsenal. Winter then grabs a weapon and kills everyone except the president, to whom he introduces himself as Nikolai Tarkovski, yet another KA sleeper agent, before knocking him out. He prepares to launch missiles at Mecca and Tehran which would kill nine million Muslims. The Islamic World would be enraged at the nuclear attacks. This would also unite 1.6 billion Sunnis and Shias together which will have severe repercussions and create a slow and painful war for the United States. Salt persuades Winter to let her into the locked down room to share the glory, but before he does, he sees television news reports that Matveyev is alive. Winter rebukes Salt for falling for Michael, instead of recruiting him, and tells her that it was he who arranged for Orlov to kidnap her husband. Salt breaks into the control room, where they fight for the nuclear football. Salt wins and aborts the strikes just in time before Peabody and Secret Service agents capture her. On the way out of the White House, while still in handcuffs, Salt manages to finally kill Winter, who survived the previous fight, by garroting him with her handcuffs. On a helicopter taking her to FBI custody, Salt tries to convince a skeptical Peabody that she saved the day. She tells him that she can hunt down the rest of the KA sleeper agents trained and planted by Orlov; she wants revenge because "they took everything from her". After receiving an SMS saying that Salt's fingerprints were found at the body-strewn barge, Peabody accepts she is telling the truth. He secretly uncuffs her, and she jumps into the Potomac River below and escapes into a wooded area.
