Gambir  is a successful sculptor, famous for his statues depicting highly pregnant women. He seems to have it all, but his success disgusts him for it is based on a sordid secret. Problem is, his agent knows this as well and blackmails Gambir into continuing this very lucrative business. Worse, stress has made him impotent, and both his wife Talyda and his mother are constantly discussing various ways to get him 'performing' again, as Talyda  desperately wants a baby. All this fades into the background when a couple of mysterious things happen. First, Gambir discovers a secret locked door in his cellar but his wife begs and pleads for him not to break it open, as it holds a secret from her past that she wants to keep hidden. Spineless as always, Gambir agrees. Also, someone starts sending vague messages to Gambir. Messages that lead him to a secret society which allows its members to watch perverted reality shows on special television channels. One of these programs shows a young boy being terribly abused by his parents, with the audience speculating about how long the child will survive.Vijn, Ard. February 05, 2009.
