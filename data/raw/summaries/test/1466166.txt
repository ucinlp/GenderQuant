Set in a rundown Danish seaside resort, it depicts a day in the life of Bernie, a self-destructive alcoholic (played by [[Mark Burns , as he takes Winnie , a young girl with a leg brace, to the resort despite constant rain. Though Winnie calls Bernie "uncle," it is very likely he is her biological father. Over the course of the day, they encounter various people whom Bernie alternately berates and scams for alcohol, while Winnie is often left alone to fend for herself. Peter Sellers makes a cameo appearance as a gay shopkeeper who flirts with Bernie.
