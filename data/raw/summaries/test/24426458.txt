Fearful that the Russians would continue their lead in the space race and be the first to put a man on the moon, NASA felt an enormous pressure to push the Apollo Program forward as quickly as possible, though they knew that pushing too hard could lead to the ultimate disaster. This film recreates the tensions that were felt not only by the three astronauts, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, but also by their families and by the teams of technicians training to deal with anything that could go wrong.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115560/fullcredits#cast
