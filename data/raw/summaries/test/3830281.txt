During the Battle of France, while the German forces are spreading quickly inside the country, the 7th Transmission Company, suffered an air raid near the Machecoul wood. After driving through the shells, the company succeeds to enter and hide itself within the wood. Captain Dumont, the company commander, sent three of his men, Louis Chaudard, Pithiviers and Tassin scouting the area and providing overwatch. After taking care of burying the radio cable beneath the sandy road, the little squad crosses the field, climbed the closing hill and took position within a wall- covered area, which occurred to be a cemetery. Unfortunately, one of the company men who was cutting down trees for camouflage, hit the wrong tree, leveling up the radio cable from the sandy road and getting it completely on sight when a German infantry division whhich chasing the unit passed. The Germans cut the cable, surround the woods and order a puzzled 7th to surrender. During that time, Chaudard and his mates, who spotted the Germans, tries with no success  to contact and join their unit. They can only witnessed their comrades captures and decide to run away. Now on their own and under the lead of Staff Sergeant Chaudard who absolutely wants to join and free his unit, the 3 soldiers began their adventures. After a long day-walk, the group stopped in a wood to pass the night. Pithiviers, who loves the situation  is more than decided to slow down the walk and patiently wait for the end of the campaign! The next day, while his mates are still sleeping, he goes for a swim in the surrounding lake, completely in sight of possible German fighters. When Chaudard and Tassin wake up, they leave the camp without their weapons to look after Pithiviers. Tassin finally finds him and after an angry warning, is convinced by Pithiviers to join him in the lake. Soon Afterwards, seeing his two men happily struggling in the water, Chaudard orders them to go out immediately but he got distracted by a rabbit and fall down in the lake fully clothed. Later, while Chaudard teaches his men how to swim like him, two German fighters appears, pushing the 3 guys out of the water. While waiting his clothes to dry, Chaudard attended an air combat between one French fighter and two Bf 109. After shooting down one of the German plane, the French pilot, Lieutenant Duvauchel, has to land in emergency and escape his plane before it blasts. When the team is ready to go, the lazy PFC Pithiviers, seeing the bad shape of one of his shoe after numerous chutes and still decided to stay on the camp, voluntarily fall down, destroying what's left of his shoe sole. Aware of the laziness of Pithiviers, Chaudard left him an angry look and decide to delay the departure. He sent Tassin, who loves to eat, in scout patrol to get food and a new pair of shoes for Pithiviers. After an hour walk, Tassin finally arrived in a farm but all his occupants were absent except the dog. After Tassin went back and the night fall down, Chaudard went to the farm and was happily welcomed by the dog. The farm holder who just got back to home with her daughter-in-law and Lt Duvauchel, welcomed Chaudard who tells her wrongly that he and his 9 men are still fighting inside the wood. Duvauchel, who was hiding behind the door, appears to a puzzled Chaudard and decide to go with him meeting the group. When Chaudard and Duvauchel finally joins the camp, Tassin and Pithiviers are roasting a rabbit they caught during Chaudard's absence. When they realized that Chaudard didn't come back alone, Tassin and Pithiviers stands the guard hiding the rabbit behind their backs. Duvauchel realized also that all what Chaudard says was a lie and took the command. The following day, the now 4 men leave the wood in early morning  and capture a German armored tow truck after killing its 2 drivers. With the former plan to abandon the truck and the two nazis in a wood, they finally realize that the vehicle is the best way to free the 7th company without being detected. Then they disguised themselves with the Germans suits and followed their road. Then they recovered one of their own who succeeded to escape and got a lot of resources from a collaborationist who confounded them with Germans. On their way, they encountered a French Gendarmerie patrol who occurred to be a 5th column one. They injured the young soldier who just joined the group and got killed by Tassin who already shot down the truck's driver. In revenge, they use their cover to destroy a German Tank thanks to the cannon gun of the tow truck. By a happy shot of luck, planning to go to Paris, they were misguided by their own colonel, took the wrong road and finally found the 7th Company with their German Guards who were bringing them in Germany. Using again their cover, they forced the guards to run in front of the truck, allowing the company to get away. When Captain Dumont joined his getaway troops, the truck with Chaudard, Tassin and Pithiviers aboard saluting the German Commander with a great smile, got away to join the 7th.
