The film is about a young man experiencing the hardships of growing up in rural South Australia, in particular dealing with the issue of racial relationships through the central characters, their involvement in local Australian rules football, and aboriginal players. In an isolated South Australian fishing town, the only thing that connects two communities the whites and the blacks is football. Gary Black  and Dumby Red  are an exception; teenage best friends from different sides of the tracks. Dumby is the star of the football team and likely to become the next big Aboriginal star in the big leagues. Gary is the bookish son of a hard-drinking and brutal white fisherman, Bob Black . He is attracted to Dumby's beautiful sister, Clarence . When their team wins the premiership, Dumby's elation is short-lived. He is passed over for the best-on-ground prize. Disgruntled, Dumby and his cousin attempt to rob the bar which the celebrations were held at, hoping to find the best-on-ground prize. After breaking into the bar, they meet a the drunk owner and repeatedly beat him until he was unconscious. They then proceed to the safe with the key they found in the owner's pocket. Bob, waking to find the owner unconscious with a wound on his head, heads to the office and loads a double barrelled shotgun. Unbeknownst to Dumby, Bob snuck behind him and fired two bullets into the figure in the darkness. After finding out he killed Dumby, Bob reloads the shotgun before Dumby's cousin, who was hiding behind the door, jumps Bob and points the gun at Bob's neck. He then reveals to Bob who he is by removing his makeshift balaclava. However, he doesn't shoot Bob and instead fires two rounds into the ceiling then runs away into the darkness. Meanwhile, Pickles Tom Budge burns down Darcy's maggots, which he earns a living from selling them to fishermen.
