Lindsay Wagner stars in this TV movie as Molly McKinley, a former nun now employed  as a rape counselor. A teenager named Sophie  seeks out Molly's help after she is raped by the scion of a wealthy family. Refusing to release a confidential file that would reveal Molly's past promiscuity—and thus seriously compromise her case against her assailant—Molly is sent to jail. The problem now becomes two-pronged: If Molly wants to be released, she must hand over information that may allow the rapist to go free; and if Sophie doesn't speak up, Molly's future career will be destroyed.
