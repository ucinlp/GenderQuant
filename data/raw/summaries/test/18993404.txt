{{plot}} The film begins in the year 1980, where a young boy named Darrin Hill and his mother, MaryAnn  are run out of town after MaryAnn was discovered to be singing secular music when she sings in a church choir also. Aunt Sally  attempts to defend MaryAnn, but it fails. The church's pastor, Reverend Lewis  is too afraid of the other church members to let her stay. MaryAnn and Darrin are last seen saying goodbye to Aunt Sally, as they sadly wave goodbye to each other. Twenty-three years later, Darrin  has grown up to become a successful advertising executive in New York City with a bad habit of lying. His best friend and secretary, Rosa Lopez  does a good job at keeping his credit problems under control. However, Darrin has achieved so much under false pretenses and faked his college degree and high school diploma. Darrin also lied about being the son of a congressman, and his lies soon catch up with him and get him in trouble with his paranoid boss  and Darrin loses his job. After being tracked down by a private investigator, Darrin finds out that Aunt Sally has died. Darrin returns to his hometown of Monte Carlo, Georgia and looks back on both comical and heartbreaking memories of MaryAnn and the experiences they had together. When Darrin arrives, he finds a new friendship in Lucious , the town's happy-go-lucky cab driver. Lucious is obsessed with women's booties and even proclaims himself a "Booty expert" and "Bootyologist". After the funeral, Darrin learns from the Reverend that Aunt Sally stated in her will that he must direct the church choir and enter the annual "Gospel Explosion" competition and win the prize money of $10,000 and Aunt Sally's stock in the company that produces the show which is worth $150,000. The main problem Darrin must deal with is the wicked church treasurer, Paulina , who is also the Reverend's sister and the same woman who bullied MaryAnn into leaving Monte Carlo. Paulina despises Darrin because of MaryAnn and she also thinks he stole her "dream job" as choir director, as she has waited years for Sally to pass away. Later that night, Darrin and Lucious go to a night club, where Darrin eventually reunites with his old childhood friend named Lilly , who happens to be the tavern's headliner. Darrin first hears Lilly sing at the club when she performs "Fever", and attempt to flirt with her, but Lilly coldly rejects Darrin by saying she has a jealous "boyfriend" named Dean. After many failed auditions, Darrin finally finds good singers, but most of them want to get paid. He cons them into the choir by saying that he will pay them half of the prize money, but secretly has no intentions of paying anybody. After a stressful effort, Darrin finally convinces Lilly to join the choir, and also bonds with Dean thereafter, who is actually her 9-year-old son she had out of wedlock. Later on, Paulina reveals that Darrin forgot to enter the choir into the auditions. Luckily, the audition judge, Luther Washington , who is also the town's prison warden, lets them perform in a show for his prisoners when the booked act fails to arrive. Thanks to Lilly's beautiful looks and voice, the choir performs well and Washington lets them into the competition. Washington also lets Darrin use three convicts who can sing well. The three convicts are Bee-Z Briggs, Lightfoot, and Mr. Johnson ([[T-Bone . After weeks of success, the choir has become more popular, more people have joined the church and the choir. Darrin also begins dating Lilly. However, Paulina takes a message for Darrin in a phone call from Rosa and learns of his past troubles, and intends on exposing him the first chance she gets. The next afternoon at a church barbecue, Paulina deliberately reveals Darrin's secrets with a polite demeanor, in order to make herself look innocent. Lilly is furious and heartbroken about this and the people who he promised money to begin to panic, and tells Darrin that she doesn't care what he does, she was only using him because he was using her. Since Lilly wants nothing to do with him, Darrin decides to quit and return to New York, where he has been offered his job back. Darrin goes back and gets a new condo and a promotion, and comes to realize that none of these things mean anything without Lilly and the choir. Darrin quits his job and returns to Monte Carlo to reconcile with Lilly. Darrin and Lilly recruits Lucious and the Reverend and they rush down to the Gospel Explosion to join the choir for the performance. When Darrin and Lilly arrive, they manage to convince the others to vote Paulina out of the choir, giving Darrin his position as director back. Before their performance begins, Darrin tells Lilly that she inspired him to name the choir The Fighting Temptations. After an outstanding performance, the choir wins the competition, but before ending his acceptance speech, Darrin proposes to Lilly. Eighteen months later, they are married with a baby. Paulina is welcomed back into the choir after having dropped her hypocritical ways. As the film ends, Lucious asks Darrin and Lilly's new baby: "You know I'm your daddy, right?", but Lilly's grandfather hears this and gives Lucious a mean stare. Lucious immediately backs away from the baby and says he was just joking.
