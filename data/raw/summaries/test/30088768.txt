Walking home on Bonfire Night through "The Ends" in Brixton, new-to-the-area nurse Sam  is mugged by a small gang of teenage hoodlums: Pest , Dennis , Jerome , Biggz , and leader Moses . The attack is interrupted when a meteorite falls from the sky into a nearby car, giving Sam the chance to escape. As Moses searches the wreck of the car for valuables his face is scratched by a pale, hairless, blind and eye-less dog-sized creature; the object which fell from the sky was its cocoon. Together, the gang chase and kill the creature. Hoping to gain fame and profit they take it to their acquanitance the cannabis dealer Ron  to gain advice, who lives at the top of their tower block, Wyndham Tower. Moses asks Ron and his boss, local gangster Hi-Hatz , to keep the creature in their fortified "weed room" while he decides how to proceed. More objects begin to fall from the sky. Eager to fight more of the creatures, the gang arm themselves and go to the nearest crash site. They find new, gorilla-sized blind aliens, these ones with spiky fur which is so black it doesn't reflect light, huge claws and multiple rows of glowing fangs. Fleeing the aliens, the gang are intercepted by the police and Moses is arrested, identified as a mugger by Sam. The aliens, following Moses, maul the police to death and attack their van, leaving Sam and Moses trapped inside. Dennis reaches the vehicle and drives the van away, only to crash the van into Hi-Hatz's car. Sam runs away while the rest of Moses' gang catch up and confront Hi-Hatz. Enraged about his car, Hi-Hatz threatens them with a gun, refusing to believe their story of aliens - until his henchman is attacked by one, allowing the gang to escape. The gang attempts to flee to Wyndham Tower but are again followed and attacked en route by the aliens, where Biggz is forced to hide in a rubbish container, and Pest gets severely bitten in the leg. They discover Sam lives in their building, force their way into her flat, and persuade her to treat Pest's leg. An infant of the furry aliens bursts in and Moses kills it with a samurai sword through the head. Sam reasons it is safer to stay with the gang than on her own and joins them. The gang moves upstairs to the flat of some neighbourhood girls believing their security gate will keep them safe. The adult furry aliens instead attack from outside, climbing up the side of the tower block, smashing through the window and they bite through Dennis' motorcycle helmet, killing him. As one alien is about to kill Moses, Sam stabs it through the head, saving him. The girls note that the aliens went straight for Moses and kick the gang out of the flat, believing them to be the focus of the creatures. In the hall, the gang is attacked by Hi-Hatz and more henchmen. The gang escapes while an alien pursues Hi-Hatz and his henchmen into a lift. Hi-Hatz kills the alien, though his henchmen perish, and continues his search for Moses. Making their way upstairs to Ron's weed room, the gang runs into more aliens, but using fireworks as distractions, they get by. Jerome, however, becomes disoriented in the smoke and is killed by an alien. Entering Ron's flat they find that Hi-Hatz is already there. Hi-Hatz prepares to shoot Moses but hordes of aliens smash through the window and tear off his face. Moses, Pest and Sam, joined by Ron's weed customer Brewis , retreat into the weed room while Ron hides in the flat. Biggz, still trapped in the bin by an awaiting adult alien, is saved by Probs and Mayhem, two unruly children, using a water-gun filled with petrol and a flame to torch the creature, since their only apparant weakness is fire. In the weed room, Brewis notices a luminescent liquid on Moses' jacket under the ultraviolet light. Brewis theorises that the aliens are like spores, drifting through space on solar winds until they chance on a suitable planet. After landing in an area with enough food, the female then lets off a strong pheromone which will attract the male creatures to it so that they can mate and propogate their species in their new world. Brewis suggests that the smaller, hairless alien which Moses killed in the beginning was such a female, and it had left a mating scent on Moses that the larger male aliens have been tracking throughout the evening. The gang form a plan for Sam, who has not been stained with the pheromone, to go to Moses' flat and turn on the gas oven. Before she leaves, Moses forces Pest to return the ring they stole from her, feeling guilty for having mugged her. Sam successfully avoids the aliens, turns on the gas and leaves the Block. Moses, with the dead female alien strapped to his back, rushes out of the weed room and into his flat, while the males converge on the scent and chase Moses through the block. Inside his flat he throws the female into the kitchen and the males follow. Using fireworks, Moses ignites the gas-filled room and leaps out the window. The explosion engulfs the flat and the aliens, but Moses survives, clinging to a Union Jack hanging from the side of the building. In the aftermath, Moses, Pest, Brewis and Ron are arrested, considered responsible for the deaths around the Block including the two policemen who had earlier arrested Moses; Sam, however, comes to their defence. In the back of the police van, Moses and Pest hear the residents of the Block cheering for Moses, causing Moses to smile for the first time.
