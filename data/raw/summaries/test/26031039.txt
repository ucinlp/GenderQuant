The film begins with a woman, Susan Alves  in a mental asylum on the island of Mauritius in 1990. She seems on edge, and frantically scribbles images of eyes and a possessed looking child, all of which are taped to her cell walls. Her husband, Joe Alves  comes to visit her. She asks about her daughter Pia, and Joe says that all she wants is for her mom to come home. As the conversation continues, Susan grows more and more nervous and keeps looking behind her at a mirror on the wall. She begins to panic and says she can't bear it any longer, and that "We need to stop him". She breaks the mirror and slits her throat in front of her husband. The film cuts to Mumbai during a scene from horror film director Vic's  most recent project. At the launch party, his wife, Pia  seems suspicious of Vic's interactions with the lead actress. At home, it is obvious that their marriage is strained. While Vic is having a drink, Pia vomits. The next morning, Vic gets a call from Pia's friend Carol  in Mauritius saying that Pia's father Joe Alves has suffered a heart attack. While in Mauritius, they stay at Pia's childhood home. Upon their arrival, it appears something is watching them from the upstairs window. While exploring her childhood nursery, it is made clear that Pia had a twin named Dia, and that the two were very close. That night, Pia has an out-of-body experience nightmare in which Dia comes in ghost form and tries to strangle her. Inanimate objects in the house are seen moving around, including a cross on the wall being turned upside down, and the swing outside moving as if someone were on it. The next morning while standing by the pool, Vic asks her if this was "the place", and a flashback is shown with Joe carrying Dia out of the pool, presumably dead. Pia is especially disturbed by this memory. She recalls that normally she was with her sister at all times, but the day Dia drowned she wasn't, and is unable to forgive herself for it. Joe is able to come home from the hospital the next day. While he is dining with Vic inside, Pia goes outside to check on Tracy, the dog. The swing is moving again and Tracy is barking ferociously at what appears to be nothing, until Pia kneels to pet the dog, and the girl's ghost is seen standing behind her. The ghost approaches her, but Pia sees nothing when she turns around. When she faces Tracy again, her hands are holding the ghost's face. When Carol comes up to her, Pia tells her about seeing Dia and Carol doesn't believe her. Pia tells Carol that since she's come back to Mauritius she's sensed something. The next morning, Pia vomits again and takes a pregnancy test which shows positive. When Pia tells the news to Carol, she seems unhappy about it and voices her concerns about Vic and the lead actress of his film. Carol dismisses it and encourages her to tell Vic, and that this chid could be what the two of them need to grow close again. Joe is sharing some old photos with Vic. He points out in one of the photos Dia's favorite doll that she took everywhere with her, and mentions she was buried with it. In another flashback, Susan is screaming at her daughter's death, and Joe believes that this is where everything changed, and that Dia's death brought on the mental instability in Susan. Vic receives a call from work saying that they need him back in Mumbai. He tries to reason with them, and becomes stressed. Pia walks in on him saying he's "stuck" in Mauritius, making her feel bad. She tells him if he wants to go back he can, and he confronts her about her distant attitude. Pia's doubts are the main cause for stress in their relationship, and he gets angry that she doesn't trust him. Pia tells him of her pregnancy and he is elated. The news puts a huge mend in to their relationship, thought it is still clear there is a supernatural presence. On Pia's birthday, someone blows out the candle before she has her chance, and the cake is infested with maggots. Later that night, she awakens to strange noises and goes to the nursery to check it out. A photo on the wall turns, and falls and breaks when Pia fixes it. Dia's ghost is crawling across the ceiling above and jumps down on her. Vic awakens to find that Pia is clearly not herself. Carol screams from outside, and Tracy is found dead with her intestines spilling out. Pia seems completely unfazed by the event which concerns Carol, knowing how much Pia loved that dog. While Carol calls her friend Aditya  about the unnatural happenings in the house and Pia's unusual behavior, the power goes out. Some knives that Joe had just put away were taken out again, and Pia is no longer where she had been reading. Carol finds her outside swinging with an expressionless look on her face. Carol suggests Pia visit Aditya, who is a parapsychologist to get some help for whatever is happening to her in that house. Carol also begins to experience unnatural things. While showering, another hand comes out of her hair. Pia invites Carol out to lunch. Suddenly, she leads Carol across the street to the subway station. She gets a call from Vic saying he's with Pia and she realizes that whoever she is with is not the real Pia. Carol flees screaming, and gets hit by a truck crossing the street. At the funeral, it is revealed that Aditya is in a wheelchair. He senses Pia's life is in danger and tells Vic to meet with him. While leaving the cemetery, Vic sees Dia's ghost for the first time. He wants to go back to Mumbai, but Pia insists on staying for a few more days. Pia is bathing in the middle of the night, and Vic comes in. He sees that it is not Pia, but the ghost who has possessed her. He tries to drown the ghost. Joe hears all the commotion, and when he reaches the bathroom, the ghost is gone and it's now Pia he's drowning. Joe is furious at Vic for seemingly trying to kill Pia, and won't listen to Vic's side of the story. Vic begins to research demonic possession as well as Aditya's credibility, and decides to heed Aditya's warning and meet with him. While Joe is visiting Pia in the hospital, she has what appears to be a seizure when she sees that her reflection in the mirror is staring at her, leading the doctors to believe she has epilepsy. Aditya explains all the medical symptoms used to describe possession, and that Pia is in the fourth of five stages of possession, and that the fifth stage is death. He suggests Vic start at the graveyard where he first saw Dia to search for answers. He happens upon Susan's grave, and goes back home. While looking at her portrait, Dia comes and stands next to him. Vic searches the attic and finds the doll that was buried with Dia. Underneath the doll is a video cassette and a truck containing diaries kept by Susan. He also uncovers some extremely morbid paintings by Susan featuring a dead fetus and images of suicide and inner turmoil. Vic visits the mental asylum, and the doctor that treated her suggests that she was mentally disturbed for a very long time and should have been brought in much earlier. On his way out, a janitor stops him and says that Susan wasn't insane, but in fact possessed by an evil spirit. Vic watches the DVD of the video cassette. There is a clip from the twins' birthday, and a clip from later that year. In the video, it is shown that Pia drowns Dia, and then gives the camera an evil smile before it shuts off. Adi too watches the video, and Vic insists on how much Pia loved her sister, and that she'd never do this. Adi suspects that there is only some truth to what they've seen and that the mystery remains unsolved. In the hospital, Pia is admiring her reflection in the window, rubbing her stomach. She pauses and realizes that her reflection is still staring at her, rubbing her stomach and causing her intense pain and causing her to contort. While watching the videotape over and over again, Adi realizes that on the video, Susan is showed scribbling away the same way she did in the asylum, showing that she was already possessed at that point. He also notices a third girl's reflection in the mirror behind the mother, realizing that Pia really wasn't with Dia that day. Vic returns to Susan's diaries in the year that Dia died and discovers more demonic drawings, and strange things like staples and threads. Vic realizes that Susan was pregnant with a third child, and it seems that the women in the family become possessed when pregnant, but neither Vic nor Adi can figure out why Susan did not become possessed while pregnant with Dia and Pia. Joe visits the hospital again after having a nightmare about Pia committing suicide in the same manner as her mother. Vic requests some information from Joe about Susan and is told to meet him at the hospital. Joe follows a possessed Pia to the rooftop, hoping to stop her from killing herself, but she throws him off the roof to his death. Instead, they must seek answers from an elder nurse at the hospital. Susan was pregnant not with twins, but triplets. Dia and Pia came out fine, but there were major complications in delivering the third child, and Joe had to take the decision to save Susan over the child. After realizing that it is the triplet's spirit agonizing the family, Vic wants to try exorcism, but Adi explains that at this point it is much too dangerous. To destroy the spirit, they kidnap Pia from the hospital and take her to Adi's workshop. A fight ensues between the spirit world and real world, and Adi takes on the spirit himself. The spirit kills him, but has left Pia's body. The spirit then begins to attack Vic, who using Adi's original plan, tries to defeats the spirit, but Pia must regain her strength and finish it off after Vic is injured. Pia goes in to labor and delivers a healthy, happy baby. Vic and she are elated. As Pia sleeps, we see the baby one last time, before its eyes go blank like the spirit's, implying that the spirit is now inside the baby and lives on.
