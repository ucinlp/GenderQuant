The film is set in the scorched desert of Southern California and Keegan, Quinn, Natalia Cigliuti, Nick Carter, Reno Wilson, Christian Monzon and Greg Grunberg play characters involved in a high-octane “TOP GUN” meets “FAST & FURIOUS” type tale about best friends who fly super fast, high-tech, experimental airplanes to deliver Mexican manufactured crystal meth throughout California in order to fund their Hollywood, rock-star lifestyle. But when a beautiful young woman, who is not what she pretends to be, infiltrates their group it sends their world and illicit operation into a tailspin. The film, which incorporates incredible, never-been-done-before, air-to-air filming of actual airplanes  with all the actors actually in the airplanes and, in some cases, at the controls while delivering dialogue.
