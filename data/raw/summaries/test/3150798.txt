A newspaper shows Porky traveling to Africa to hunt the rare dodo bird, worth $6,000,000,000,000. Porky uses his airplane to go to Dark Africa, then Darker Africa, and finally lands in Darkest Africa . When Porky lands, a sign tells him that he's in Wackyland , while a scary voice booms out "IT CAN HAPPEN... HERE!" Soon he sees many strange, weird, and oafish creatures around. Suddenly, the last dodo of the dodo species appears. Porky tries to catch the dodo, but the dodo plays tricks on him. At one time, the dodo appears on the Warner Brothers shield and sling shots Porky into the ground. Finally, Porky dresses as another dodo, announcing himself to be the last dodo. The dodo handcuffs himself to Porky, claiming "I've got the last Dodo!" and runs with Porky to claim the reward. Porky reveals himself, and still handcuffed to the dodo, runs off with him, now proclaiming: "Oh, no, you haven't! I-I'm rich! I-I've got the last D-D-Dodo!" Once they disappear over the horizon, scores of dodos appear to confirm this.
