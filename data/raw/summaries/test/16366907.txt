The movie is about an average police officer who mistakenly believes he has a fatal disease and is about to die soon. He eyes the insurance payout his family would get if he dies in action and embarks on impossible missions to get himself killed in action. Little does he know that the diagnosis is wrong and he is in fact healthy. The movie comically chronicles his new found bravado.
