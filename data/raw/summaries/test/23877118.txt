Set in the 17th-century, an Italian nobleman weds an impoverished countess, who is wooed by the King of Piedmont and faces pressure from his entire court to succumb to his wishes.  In the middle 16th century Duke Emmanuel Philibert moved the Duchy's capital from Chamb√©ry to Turin. In the early 18th century the Savoy family acquired the title of Kings of Sardinia.
