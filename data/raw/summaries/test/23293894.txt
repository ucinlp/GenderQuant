Koo Chi-Ming  is a life-insurance investigator who while driving on a rainy night to his engagement party, loses control of his car and almost runs over a young girl named Siu-Yu . Eventually Chi-Ming arrives at his parent's house where the party is being held. He and his father  soon begin getting henpecked by Chi-Ming's mother  and his fiancée Ivy . Later after the party has ended, everyone decides to have some fun fooling around with a Ouija board by attempting to talk to a spirit. This is commonly known as 玩碟仙 or "playing with spirits via a saucer". Before they begin, Chi-Ming's little brother explains that after they are finished they must send the spirit back, otherwise a spot of blood will appear under the small saucer which they are using, and the person last holding the saucer will be haunted by the spirit. At the same time, Siu-Yu, whom Chi-Ming nearly ran over, is at her apartment on the roof with her goddaughter Mimi. Siu-Yu sees that Mimi is playing very close to the edge and rushes forward to grab her. Siu-Yu's foot accidentally lands on a skateboard which sends her over the edge of the roof falling to her death. Back at the house, as soon as Siu-Yu dies, the saucer begins to show signs of movement and points out the spirit's name, "Chang Siu-Yu" and her address. The saucer then begins to circle violently around the board and everyone is thrown backwards, apart from Chi-Ming, who held on until the last movement at which point the saucer flips over to reveal a small spot of blood. The next day at work, Chi-Ming is handed two cases to investigate by his boss , one of which belongs to the girl who died. Chi-Ming takes the other one, but the spirit of Siu-Yu switched the files. While looking through the case file, Chi-Ming notices that the name and address of the deceased is the same as the one spelled out on the Ouija board. After visiting the deceased girl's apartment, realizes that the girl who died, Siu-Yu, was the girl he almost ran over the night before. After returning home the ghost of Siu-Yu appears to Chi-Ming and tells him that it was an accident, and to pay the money to her goddaughter Mimi. At work Chi-Ming is about to write up his report but his boss intervenes and tells him they can't afford to payout, and to say that the girl committed suicide. Later, Siu-Yu reappears to him and he tells her that he can't help as it is his boss's decision. After hearing this Siu-Yu makes a fool out of Chi-Ming's boss causing him to fire Chi-Ming. Chi-Ming takes losing his job hard and decides to get drunk ending with him being thrown in jail only later to be bailed out and re-hired by his former boss who has had a change of heart after Siu-Yu begins haunting him again. Now a free man and with a promotion, Chi-Ming begins a romantic relationship with Siu-Yu much to the dismay of his girlfriend who along with Chi-Ming's mother hire exorcist Dr. Han. They all go to Chi-Ming's apartment where Dr. Han explains that while he is performing the exorcism the front door which he calls "the door of life" can't be opened as this will cause the "door of death" to open. He also instructs Ivy to keep Chi-Ming away from his apartment during the exorcism. Ivy takes Chi-Ming out to a club to distract him, but while sitting in a crowd watching a dance performance he spots Siu-Yu on stage and in great distress. At the same time, in Chi-Ming's apartment, Dr. Han starts to summon Siu-Yu which causes Siu-Yu to disappear in front of Chi-Ming. Ming rushes home as fast as he can to find Dr. Han in the middle of the exorcism. Ming rushes to help Siu-Yu, but by opening the door, he has triggered the opening of the "door of death". Dr. Han runs away, and everything in the room is sucked out the window, along with Chi-Ming and Siu-Yu. Chi-Ming grabs the balcony railing but Siu-Yu lets go of his hand and is sucked into the sky. Deeply in love with her, Chi-Ming tries to follow her, by letting go of the railing, but falls 18 floors onto a parked car. After recovering in the hospital, Chi-Ming returns to where he first saw Siu-Yu, in hope of finding her. He walks out onto the road and is nearly hit by a car. Looking through the window for a split second, he thought the female driver was Siu-Yu, but then notices it isn't and lets her drive away. With an emotional look, he removes his glasses and looks up into the sky with a smile.
