Jonathan Rivers  is a successful architect and lives a peaceful life with his wife Anna  until her unexpected disappearance. Eventually, he is contacted by Raymond Price , who claims that his own son had also died. He says he has recorded messages from Anna through Electronic voice phenomena . While Jonathan is initially dismissive and angered he later learns about his wife's tragic drowning. Desperate, he begins to believe that the recorded voice is indeed that of his wife. Jonathan becomes obsessed with trying to contact her himself, despite warnings from a psychic who tries to tell him how the recording can attract other, unwanted entities. A woman named Sarah Tate  befriends Jonathan because she lost her fianc√©. Raymond is found dead. Jonathan begins to be followed by three demons attracted by his obsession with EVP, and finds that some of the messages he is coming across are from people who are not yet dead, but may soon be. Jonathan then hears cries from a woman who he finds in a car with a child. He is able to save the child, but not the woman. At the funeral, which Jonathan and Sarah both attend, Jonathan approaches the husband and tells him about what happened. The husband thanks Jonathan for saving his son but then asks him to leave them alone. The husband continues to tell Jonathan to stay away from him and his family. Afterwards, Jonathan sees images of another person, a missing woman named Mary Freeman, while working with his EVP devices. Sarah is later seriously injured by a fall from a balcony while possessed by the demons. Jonathan locates the site of his wife's death by following signs on recordings, and finds a construction worker from his company holding Mary captive. The three demons torture Jonathan by breaking his arms and legs and cause him to fall to his death, but a SWAT team along with Detective Smits  arrives and are able to save Mary by shooting the construction worker. After his funeral, Jonathan's voice can be heard on the radio through static interference saying "I'm sorry" to his son. The child recognizes the voice and smiles. Sarah, at the graveside in a wheelchair, is menaced by odd noises. And right before the credits roll in the camera flashes to a T.V. where Jonathan and his wife are visible.
