Roy Alston  and Bo Richards  are the two outsiders of their high school community. On the eve of their graduation, Roy and Bo drunkenly crash a party thrown by a fellow graduate. Their presence causes trouble, and the boys insult one of the popular girls and Roy urinates in the pool. When they leave, they come across the dog that belongs to the household of the party they crashed. They steal the dog, named Bon-Bon, and change his name to "Boner the Barbarian." Bo receives $200 as a graduation gift from his grandparents. Facing a lifetime working a blue-collar factory job, the boys spontaneously decide to use the money to go on a vacation to Los Angeles. When they arrive in the big city, Bo expresses his wish that the world could just "go caveman" for one day, and eschew societal and legal rules. Roy agrees, and responds to this confession by revealing his own secret of "having something inside" of him. The mixture of teenage angst, desire for anarchy, and sexual lust, turns into a crime spree that leaves a trail of death and destruction. When the boys stop for gas, Bo gives the cashier two crumpled dollar bills. When Roy says that the machine only gave them two dollars of gas, Bo doesn't realize his mistake, and tells the cashier that he gave him six dollars. Roy responds to the conflict by taking a tire iron from the car and attacking the cashier. While Roy is beating the cashier, Bo goes inside and steals handfuls of bubble gum. After the theft and the beating, the boys take off in their car. The boys then go to a boardwalk, where a few people are smoking marijuana and beating a drum. An elderly woman begins to loudly chastise them. Roy throws an empty beer bottle in the air and it hits the woman on the forehead. Three young women see this, and chase Bo and Roy to their car in the parking lot. Amid the chaos, Boner the Barbarian is forgotten on the boardwalk. The young trio of women yell at the boys and beat their car. One woman climbs on the hood of the car while another tears off the car antenna. Amid the insults, the boys are called "faggots". This particular insult sparks rage in Roy, who then starts the car and drives around in circles in the parking lot with the woman still on the hood. After several loops, Roy throws the car into reverse, and the woman is thrown from the hood of the car. Several additional encounters lead to additional deaths, including a girl named Angie , whom Roy kills when she chooses Bo over him. Eventually they are tracked and found by the FBI and LAPD and are cornered at a shopping mall where Roy and Bo have a standoff.
