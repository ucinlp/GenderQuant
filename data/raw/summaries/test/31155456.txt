Jayadevan , the blind poet, has a burning passion to earn literary fame, but fate conspires to deny it to him for long. And when it comes, he disdains it. Spurned by his sister and duped by the crook Vikraman , Jayadevan wanders from place to place and comes across a girl Sreedevi , who, after initial suspicions, nurses him back to vision and falls in love with him. But ill-luck chases him even to prison. Meanwhile, Vikram gets hold of Jayadevan's monumental work, the manuscript of his collection of poems, and publishes it in his own name which gains instant recognition. While Vikram is about to be honoured for this, Jayadevan succeeds in unfolding the truth. Yet in this moment of truimph and glory, he declines both the public encomium and the hand of Sridevi.
