In a cemetery, a warlock wearing a hat, mask and coat comes out of a tombstone to explore the outside of his vicinity. Very magical, he could fly as well as pass through small openings. While travelling through the air, the warlock found a studio where actors are making auditions while others are doing rehearsals. As he entered, he saw a lady chimp weeping. The warlock approached her and asked why she was crying. Speaking unintelligibly, the chimp told him she desperately wanted to sing at the audition and possibly make it to concerts. Unfortunately, her tongue was knotted, thus she couldn't even say a simple word. Feeling sorry for the chimp as well as falling in love with her, the warlock decides to help out. To assist his love interest, the warlock placed a turn table in the chimp's skirt where she will lipsync while the record plays the song. The chimp sets foot on the audition stage and performs her act although it wasn't a smooth one. The record repeated a line so many times and even slowed down. Nevertheless, the studio staff who were watching didn't seem to mind. When the record stopped in the middle of the song, the warlock secretly came to her aid and turns the phonograph's cluster. The song continues and the chimp was "singing" again. She even managed to do well on the final lines, much to the delight of those in attendance. As the chimp happily gets down from the stage, the overjoyed warlock decides to congratulate her with an embrace. Much to the warlock's surprise, however, the chimp sidesteps him and walks to the other guy standing behind. That other guy is none other than Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Feeling insulted by this, the warlock grabs the chimp and takes her to a secret room within the studio. Upon reaching his secret place, the warlock decides to play the organ of the room. As he plays, he advised the chimp not to take off his mask. Curious of why she should not, the chimp opted to do so as she tiptoed towards the warlock. As she removes the mask of her captive, the chimp was surprised to find out that the warlock's face had no skin or flesh, and is therefore a skeleton in garments. Oswald somehow managed to locate the secret room and knocks on the door loudly. Disturbed by the noise, the warlock leaves the chimp inside and decides to confront the rabbit. Seeing the warlock fly toward him, Oswald ran away as quickly as he could. On his getaway, Oswald stumbled and falls into a hole. Upon landing into the bottom floor, the rabbit was bumped by a few large lizards that passed by. Oswald then thought his troubles were over but more still await as the warlock followed him there. Instead of tormenting the rabbit, the warlock chooses to just ask a riddle. He asked "What does the chicken say when it lays a square egg?" Not sure of an answer, Oswald gives up and admits not having any idea. The warlock then slaps Oswald in the face, causing the rabbit to say "Ouch!" The warlock also discloses to Oswald that "Ouch!" was the answer and he elatedly disappears. From there, nobody saw the warlock again.
