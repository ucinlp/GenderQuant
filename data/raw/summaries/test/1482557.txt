A sideplot in the film involves a married South Korean couple who encounter difficulties in their relationship because of the ongoing war. A United States Army major's wife Barbara Hallsworth  lives in a village located at the 38th Parallel, where she was attempting to buy antique furniture and items for her business as an interior decorator. She hears a bulletin over the radio "The communists are coming", and decides to leave the village. She encounters a group of five South Korean children, and after her chauffeur is killed, she drives them to a safe location called the "Inn of the Sixth Happiness". Along the way, she kills a North Korean soldier by shooting him between the eyes.{{cite news}} Longfellow , a second reporter awaiting the press conference, is generally a music critic but also reports on serious events developing in Tokyo.
