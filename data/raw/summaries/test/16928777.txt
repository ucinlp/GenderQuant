A community of cloistered nuns in a Catholic convent on the outskirts of Montreal awake one night to terrible screams. A young novice, Sister Agnes, is found in her cell in a pool of blood. After she is taken in ambulance, the Mother Superior, Mother Miriam Ruth, finds a newborn baby, dead and wrapped in bloody sheets in a wastebasket in Sister Agnes’ room. It is clear that Agnes gave birth to the child and strangled it afterwards, but she has no recollection - not only of giving birth, but of ever being pregnant. The young novice is accused of killing the baby. The court assigns Dr. Martha Livingston, a psychologist, to determine if Sister Agnes is sane enough to stand trial. The judicial system is clearly inclined to think that the young nun is insane and does not wish to send her to jail. Only reluctantly does the chain-smoking Martha take on the case to determine the nun’s sanity. Martha sees the nuns for the first time out of the courthouse and goes to visit them at the convent. The worldly and wise Mother Miriam receives Martha with apprehension. It is nothing personal, she tells her, but she does not believe in psychiatry. She makes pretty clear that, like everybody else, she was taken completely by surprise by what happened. Nobody had any idea of Agnes' pregnancy, not even Agnes herself. Agnes, she tells Martha, received very little schooling and came to the convent at a very young age after her mother’s death. Mother Miriam believes that Agnes has been touched by God. Martha interviews Agnes, who is of extreme devotion and parallel innocence. Agnes has a vague idea of how babies are born, but does not know how they are made. The day of the incident, she felt sick after night prayers and retired to her bedroom. She felt sicker and sicker until she fell asleep. Everybody is asking her for the baby, she says, but she saw no baby. The only thing she knows is what she has been told. The baby was found dead in the wastebasket in her bedroom.
