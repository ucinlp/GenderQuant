Early in the morning, Rama, an expectant father and rookie officer, and a 20-man SWAT team led by Sergeant Jaka and Lieutenant Wahyu, arrive at an apartment block in Jakarta's slums undetected. It is run by Tama Riyada, a crime lord, who is the target of the task force. While detaining various tenants of the apartment, the team eventually detains a man who is delivering medicine to his sick wife. However, before the team enters the apartment, he escapes. The team infiltrates the apartment block floor by floor until they reach the sixth floor. However, the team is seen by a young lookout, who raises the alarm before he is shot and killed. Tama calls in reinforcements, who systematically take out a majority of the SWAT members and regain control of most of the apartment. Tama turns off the power to the whole building and announces that the SWAT team is trapped on the sixth floor and he will grant free permanent residence to those who kill the intruders. The team is soon ambushed by shooters from above, as well as others who flank them from behind. During the battle, Jaka learns from Wahyu that the mission isn't sanctioned by the force, meaning they can't call for backup. The team runs to another room, where Bowo is shot and injured. The team narrowly escape after Rama improvises an explosion that kills the pursuing tenants. The team splits into two groups; Jaka, Wahyu, and Dagu go to the fifth floor, while Rama and Bowo retreat to seventh. Rama and Bowo make their way to the apartment of the man with the sick wife, who reluctantly agrees to hide them. They hide in a secret passage behind a wall. A gang arrives and inspects the man's apartment, but they find no one, and leave. After removing the bullet stuck in Bowo, Rama leaves him in the care of the man's family as he goes out and fights again. Rama is eventually captured by Andi, Tama's right hand man. At the same time, Jaka and his group are found by Mad Dog, Tama's ruthless henchman. Wahyu makes his escape, and Dagu is ordered to follow him. Jaka, with only a knife, is confronted by Mad Dog, who holds him at gunpoint. Mad Dog leads Jaka to his apartment, where he challenges Jaka to a fight and kills him. Meanwhile at Andi's apartment, Andi reveals himself to be Rama's estranged brother. Andi lets Rama know when it will be safe as he meets up with Mad Dog, who drags Jaka's body to Tama. Tama learns of Andi's betrayal from the closed-circuit camera footage of Rama, who goes to Andi's apartment; Tama stabs Andi in the hand before turning him over to Mad Dog. Rama regroups with Wahyu and Dagu, who go on to fight in a narcotics lab, and then to the 15th floor where Tama is located. On the way up, Rama finds a room where Andi is being beaten by Mad Dog. As he enters, Mad Dog frees Andi. Rama and Andi team up against Mad Dog, and after sustaining more brutal beatings, eventually kill him. Meanwhile, Wahyu and Dagu confront Tama, but Wahyu shoots and kills Dagu. Wahyu is convinced that holding Tama hostage will allow him to escape. Rama and Andi run into Wahyu and Tama, but are fired at by Wahyu. While Wahyu keeps the two at bay, Tama gloats that his actions are futile because of the corruption on the police force. After realizing the depth of corruption, and his eventual arrest, Wahyu shoots Tama in the head; he attempts to shoot himself, but runs out of bullets. Andi gives Rama a list of corrupt officers. Rama asks Andi to come along, but he refuses, due to his acclimation to his lifestyle. Andi returns to the apartment, while Rama leaves with Bowo and a detained Wahyu.
