Experiment is set in a town, where the citizens were forced walk everywhere by foot because of constant traffic jams. To solve this situation, city officials decided to conduct an experiment: people were allowed to fly. Most citizens immediately grew wings and quickly moved to a new lifestyle, however, for some reason wings did not grow on few others. To find such wingless people a place for life, they decided to appoint flight supervisors and invented strict rules and regulations for the flights.
