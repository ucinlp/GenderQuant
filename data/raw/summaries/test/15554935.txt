Rajan Mathur  is college professor who lives in Chandni Chowk district in NewDelhi, with his wife Roma Mathur , who is a social activist and feminist, and their young daughter. Professor Mathur meets Numair Qazi , who informs him that he is a victim of communal riots in Gujarat. He is actually a suicide bomber of an Islamic fundamentalist group who has been ordered to set off a bomb near Red Fort during the 15 August independence celebration. Numair wins the trust of the professor and his wife. While assisting Numair to get an employment entry pass for the celebrations at Red Fort, Professor Mathur introduces him to a variety of people living in harmony in Chandni Chowk regardless of faith. Numair is no longer sure if he should carry out the orders of his superiors or not. Although he is a deep-rooted fundamentalist, he sees this area as colourful and loving. There is no Black and White. Nonetheless, he goes forward to accomplish his mission.
