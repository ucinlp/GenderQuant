Techno Destructo is behind all of the major assaults on Gwar since his enslavement in 1991 - attracting the attention of the Morality Squad, summoning Cardinal Syn, who in turn dispatched Skulhedface, confusing the band into thinking the year was 1999 , so that they would think the coming of Cardinal Syn was, in fact, the comet RagNaRok, and the slave revolts. Though they all ended in failure, he has yet another plan - genetically modify abused  penguins into his army, hypnotize Slymenstra Hymen with radioactive crack cocaine, and marry her . Techno builds a robot clone of Sleazy P. Martini, and uses him to distribute the crack, while the band beats up penguins . With the band incapacitated, he proposes to Slymenstra , and sends the first wave of mutant penguins after Gwar. They are promptly defeated. The wedding, officiated by the Pope, turns into disaster, when the crack wears off, and Slymenstra uses her nether region to punish Techno. In the backdrop of "Hate Love Songs," he jousts Oderus. After he is defeated again, he commandeers the microphone, regains his robotic arm  with the slaves' help, and attacks Gwar. Though he initially defeats the band, Oderus and Slymenstra ultimately win out long enough for a newly-revived Gor-Gor  to start eating him. The concert ends with the subdued "Don't Need A Man" video, featuring Balsac the Jaws of Death on piano, Beefcake the Mighty on upright bass, Jizmak Da Gusha on a minimal  drum kit, and Slymenstra's lounge singing.
