Out of the Dark has earned a reputation as Stephen Chow's darkest film yet, adding brutal violence, gore, blood, and the wealth of black humor also including Chow's signature nonsense jokes. The film was directed by Hong Kong's Jeffrey Lau. Stephen Chow is Leon, a mental patient/ghostbuster who attempts to replicate the character LÃ©on from the 1994 French film The Professional who talks to his plant for assistant, co-starring Karen Mok as Ah Qun, a curious young girl who gets caught up with all the spooky situations; the pair then unites together with the help of a brigade of quirky security guards in an attempt to get rid of the evil lurking in a supposedly haunted apartment building situated in Hong Kong.1
