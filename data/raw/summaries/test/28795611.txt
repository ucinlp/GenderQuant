Set in the 1930s, and narrated like an old ballad, The Tiger from Tjampa tells the story of a young man, Lukman  who seeks to avenge his father's murder by learning , Indonesia's traditional form of self defence, based on the movements of animals. The pencak silat shown in the film is regionally specific to West Sumatra. Lukman pleads Datuk Langit  to teach him, the man having asked him for three buffalos as payment which is beyond his means. Lukman then witnesses a man beat his opponent in a fight quite easily and begs him to teach him silat. The man agrees with the condition that his silat would not be used for oppressing the weak, but for self defense only. Lukman breaks his promise numerous times, but every time his teacher always manages to forgive him until his lessons are complete. Lukman then once defies his teacher by killing a gambler, and is imprisoned. In jail, Lukman learns that Datuk Langit is responsible for his father's death. He manages to escape from prison and confront him, finally defeating him, after which he turns both him and himself to the authorities. The Tiger from Tjampa is by no means a simple story of revenge, but is really an exploration of the practise and philosophical bases of pencak silat, and its relation to Islamic values. Lukman is repeatedly shown to be intemperate, and easily provoked. Besides learning the martial art, he must also learn perseverance and self-restraint. He must learn tunggu sabar .
