A scientist, Professor Calvin Q. Calculus, successfully creates a portable hole invention, despite disapproval from his nagging wife. He displays his creation in a newsreel, showcasing the various uses for a portable hole: Rescuing a baby from a safe, cheating at your golf game, and giving dogs a new place to bury their bones. Spurred by the film, a thief steals Calvin's portable hole and uses it for criminal purposes, including emptying Fort Knox and abducting a dancing girl from a burlesque house. However, he is chased by the police until he is backed against a wall; he uses the last portable hole in the briefcase to go through the wall and seemingly escape, but it's revealed that the other side is inside a prison. Calvin reads about the arrest in the paper and is glad, but Calvin's domineering wife chews him out for not treating her right. In retaliation, Calvin creates one more portable hole and throws it on the floor. The wife steps in it and falls through it. After a few seconds, Satan comes up the portable hole, throws her back to Earth and replies: "Isn't it bad enough down there without her?"
