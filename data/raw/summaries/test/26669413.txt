The hero Ching-yan has been dreaming of a beautiful woman every night for 28 years and he vows to find his dream girl. He travels to the Snowy Mountain in search of her together with his godson and a mad doctor. Business in the Last-Stop-in-Life Hotel at the base of the mountain has been good, as many people have ventured to the mountain in search of the legendary Ice Maiden, but none have returned. The innkeeper develops a crush on Ching-Yan and pretends to be the Ice Maiden to entice him, but Ching-Yan does not believe her and insists on going up the mountain to look for the real Ice Maiden. On the way, he angers the Devil King and is rescued by the Ice Maiden. In doing so, the Ice Maiden ages 200 years overnight, but Ching-Yan still wants to marry her even though the Devil King does not allow them to leave. Eventually, the innkeeper sacrifices herself for Ching-Yan, allowing Ching-Yan to engage the Devil King in one final battle. Ching-Yan emerges victorious and is finally together with his dream lover.
