The film is set on the coasts of Newfoundland and focuses on the rivalry between a seal hunter and a local jinx. Worried that the jinx may attempt to steal his girlfriend, the seal-hunter forces the alleged coward to accompany him on an Arctic expedition. They both end up in a hunting party on the ice floes and eventually find themselves stranded. The hunter tries to kill the jinx, but the snow blinds him and he misses. Despite the murder attempt, the jinx helps the hunter back to the safety of their ship called The Viking. On recovering his sight, the hunter gains new respect for the jinx and vows that he will beat senseless any man who derides the character of his new friend.
