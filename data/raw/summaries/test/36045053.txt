= In a squaters area in Manila, a young Neneng  received expired chocolate from somebody and her grandmother  said that she should always ask before getting something, so thats why Neneng always says Bakit? or Why?, after the incident her neighbor told her that her grandmother died when 5 tires accidentally fell on her. Fast forward a few years....Neneng  now a waitress was being harassed by some costumers and Boy Pick Up saw her and he saved her and coincidentally he was searching for the right Pick Up Girl so when he heard Neneng say Bakit? he knew that she was the right one and thats the reason why Neneng B. came to be.
