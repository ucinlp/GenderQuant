Terri Griffith  is an aspiring teenage journalist living in Tucson, Arizona who feels that teachers don't take her school newspaper articles seriously because of her good looks. After failing to get her dream job as a newspaper intern, she comes to the conclusion that it is because she is a girl. With her parents out of town, Terri decides to remedy the situation. Enrolling at a rival high school, she enlists the help of her sex-obsessed loudmouth little brother, Buddy  and her best friend Denise  to disguise herself as a boy. Her brother and friend also help to keep tabs on her throughout the experiment. Along the way she meets Rick , a gold-hearted nerd who becomes her pet project. After helping him through an image makeover and encouraging him to start talking to girls , Terri starts to fall for him. After many episodes in and out of school, including fending off a group of bullies led by bodybuilder Greg Tolan , dealing with her real college boyfriend Kevin  and being set up on a blind date with a potential new "girlfriend" named Sandy , Terri manages to be accepted as "one of the guys". At the senior prom, a jealous Greg picks a fight with Rick, who ultimately trounces the bully in front of the entire class. But when Terri's boyfriend shows up unexpectedly and finds out what's been going on, Terri has no choice but to reveal herself to Rick. Although she admits to loving him, Rick angrily rejects her, prompting a desperate Terri to kiss him in front of everyone. Seemingly unfazed, Rick simply walks away. Heartbroken and humiliated, Terri retreats to her room and writes a long article on what it is like to be a girl in boy's clothing, detailing all of her experiences, both good and bad, in and out of school. In the end, Terri returns to her own school. When her article is printed in the newspaper, she receives high praise from her teachers and friends and finally earns her dream job at the newspaper office. Nevertheless, she still finds herself yearning for Rick, who has not spoken to her since the prom. Now without a boyfriend, Terri is not looking forward to the summer, but her spirits lift when Rick suddenly turns up after reading her article. Realizing their true feelings for each other, they reconcile, and the film ends as they drive away together.
