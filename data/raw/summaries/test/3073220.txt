Vittorio , nicknamed "Accattone" , leads a mostly serene life as a pimp until his prostitute, Maddalena, is hurt by his rivals and sent to prison. Finding himself without a steady income, and not much inclination for working himself, he discovers the naive Stella and tries to lure her into prostituting herself for him. Hesitant at first, she later embraces her new profession  more willingly. However, it is too late for Accattone, who, after a bizarre vision of his own death, is killed in a traffic accident when he tries to evade the police on a stolen motorcycle.
