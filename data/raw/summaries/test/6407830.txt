The film opens with a man getting beaten by his opponent, then after the guy finds out the fight was rigged, decides to fight back. The opponent is dead on the floor, and the first guy is announced as the winner. On his way back to his home, he is killed by another man. Back in the United States, retired boxer Jake Raye  and co-owner of Hal and Jake’s self-defense class receives a call from the Philippines police department. He is told his half-brother Michael is dead, and must pick up the body in Manila. Jake travels to Manila and collects the body, but decides to stay there and find his killer. Jake gets training help from a man named Kwong  and stays with local kickboxer Baby Davies , whom a local Filipino neighbor Angela  has a thing for, and his sister Nancy . Kwong tells Jake about a gladiator-like tournament known as the Red Fist Tournament where only one comes out alive, and his brother’s killer will likely be there. Kwong trains Jake for the tournament and enters him. He manages to win all the fights and proceeds to the final match, where he faces off with Chin Woo . Kwong tells him that Chin Woo is his brother’s killer, and also the fighter who put Baby Davis in a coma. Hal, who has come from California to watch Raye’s final bout, informs Raye that Kwong is the killer after Kwong drugs Raye. Angela comes in with a gun, but dies at the hands of Chin Woo. Woo is defeated by Raye, who sets off after Michael’s true killer. It is revealed that Kwong has a brother, who died at the hands of Michael that fateful night, and Kwong is the one who murdered him. Kwong fights Raye in the same alley where Michael met his fate. Jake is badly wounded, but finishes Kwong and impales him on a fence. Nancy and Jake walk off into the night.
