Will Shaw arrives in Spain from San Francisco for a holiday he really doesn't want. He is picked up by his father, Martin, who works in various different countries for the government. In the evening, phone calls put Will in a bad mood and he decides to go fishing the next day. Will is still preoccupied with the phone calls, resulting in an accident which causes his brother's girlfriend to be hit on the side of the head by the sail. Will decides to swim into town to fetch medicine. When he swims back, the boat is gone, and he finds it abandoned. He runs to a local police station where the officer in charge finds out his name and makes a phone call, before asking Will to take him to the boat. They are met there by Zahir, who knows where Will's family is and invites him to show him the way, but Will decides to escape in the police car but doesn't get far. He crashes into a tree and is almost killed until Martin shows up and escapes with him. He reveals he is a CIA agent and that the people who have taken their family are after a briefcase he took. He calls his partner who agrees to meet him in Madrid. They go to the meeting and Will stays in the car while Martin talks to his partner, Jean, who says that she doesn't have the briefcase anymore. He doesn't believe her and thinks something isn't right. As he returns to the car, a sniper murders Martin, and Will is attacked by a man. Will barely escapes but the man follows him through the streets of Madrid. After escaping, he has no money and decides to hide his dad's gun in the trash. Going to the U.S Embassy, Will discovers that he is wanted for killing a police officer which he denies, but they are not interested in finding his family. The Embassy then tells him someone wants to meet him. Jean and Diego wait for him, and Jean says she wants to help. He doesn't trust her and fakes illness to escape. Looking through his father's phone, he sees that Diego's name comes up several times and calls it. He also gets a call from the kidnappers who want to speak to "Tom" and say they want the briefcase in exchange for his family. The kidnappers give Will a deadline and meeting point. During this call Will speaks to his mother and tells her Martin was killed. He arrives at Diego's office and speaks to Lucia, the girl who he spoke to on the phone. Suddenly, Diego appears and fights with Will, who kills him. Lucia and Will go to her uncle's apartment but find out that Jean and her hitman Gorman have killed her uncle. Will finds and confronts Jean and Gorman in the kitchen. She wants him to follow her but is interrupted by Lucia coming in. They escape through the rooftops and Will is shot. Instead of a hospital, she takes Will to a nightclub where her friend has medical experience. Will also finds out that Tom is Martin's alias in Spain, and that Lucia is his half sister. Will recovers and goes to a meeting with the kidnapper on the phone. The man on the phone is Zahir who initially beats up Will for information. Once he realizes Will really is ignorant of what is happening, Zahir tells him the truth. The briefcase was stolen from a Mossad agent by Martin. Zahir is an Israeli agent determined to recover the case. He realises that Jean is the corrupt agent, not Martin and she wants to sell the contents of the case. He decides to use Will to lure out Jean and the buyers of the briefcase. Zahir shows Will's family saying he must do as he says, and this must succeed or the family will be released and Jean will kill them. Will has a plan to lure out Jean by using Lucia's credit card at the club. This lures out Gorman who is subdued by the bouncers at the club and tortured for information. Gorman gives nothing away and Will's next plan is to make him think he has escaped so they can follow him. This works and they follow him to Jean, who then lead them to an underground car park. The Israeli agents follow but a noise spooks Jean who kills the buyers and tries to escape. Gorman is killed trying to escape in his car, and Will and Lucia then pursue Jean. After a pursuit through Madrid, the roles are reversed and Jean chases them due to her frustration with their interference. The cars then collide, and Will's car is worse off. Just as Jean is about to deliver the final blow, she is taken out by Zahir, who retrieves the briefcase. As Lucia recovers in hospital, she also meets her new half family, and Will is offered a job in the CIA.
