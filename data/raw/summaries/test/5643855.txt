On a foggy night in 1850, Mary Rutledge , accompanied by retired Colonel Marcus Aurelius Cobb , arrives in San Francisco Bay from New York aboard the Flying Cloud. A gold digger of the other kind, she has come to wed the wealthy owner of a local saloon. The men at the wharf are more than happy to greet the 'white woman,'At the end of 1849, the population of the city numbered approximately 20,000, of which only about 300 were women. Most were harlots and some historians believe that a mere 15 or so were white. For more information, see http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hbtbcidx.htm but reluctant to inform her that her fianc√© is dead, murdered most likely by a certain Louis Chamalis , the powerful owner of another Barbary Coast establishment, the Bella Donna restaurant and gambling house. Mary is at first quite upset, but quickly pulls herself together and asks the way to the Bella Donna, with a look of ambition on her face. Mary meets Chamalis and quickly agrees to be his companion, not only for economic reasons , but for personal pleasure as well. Chamalis gives her the name 'Swan' and she becomes more or less his female escort. She accompanies him on promenades in town  and he showers her with extravagant gifts. Their relationship sours rather quickly, however, and Swan is angered by some of Chamalis's destructive power-mongering. She does not, however, mind running a crooked roulette wheel and cheating the miners out of their gold. Colonel Cobb, in the meantime, has opened a printing press, with the intention of starting a respectable newspaper for the people of San Francisco. He and his colleagues successfully print the first paper, which includes an article criticizing a recent unpunished murder by Chamalis and his entourage. When Chamalis finds out, he tries to destroy Cobb's newly acquired machine and threatens burning down the building, but is halted by Swan, who comes to Cobb's defence. Chamalis, nonetheless, demands that Cobb never print anything attacking him. The colonel unwillingly complies. Time passes and Swan, disillusioned with her life in San Francisco, saddens. Her distant behavior irks Chamalis, who feels frustrated and stonewalled. One dreary morning she sets out on horseback. Later in the day it begins to rain heavily and she seeks refuge in a small seemingly abandoned cabin, where she meets a tall lonesome poet and gold miner named Jim Carmichael . Swan is quite taken with him, but lies about her current situation after hearing his criticisms of the harlots and thieves of the city. He offers her his book of poems as a memento and she returns to the Bella Donna. Later Carmichael decides to return to his home state New York and must pass through San Francisco. Unfortunately because of fog the ship will not leave for a few days. He encounters Chamalis' helper, Old Atrocity , who, remarking his bags of gold is happy to show him to a nice hotel and restaurant. Carmichael  winds up at the Bella Donna and is surprised to find Mary working there. He is served a drugged up liquor and plays roulette at her table. He cannot retain his composure, vehemently insults 'Swan' and eventually bets and loses most of his money. The rest is pickpocketed. Carmichael wakes up the following morning in the Bella Donna's kitchen. His eloquent speech impresses Chamalis, who hires him on the spot as a waiter. Carmichael's presence perturbs Mary, who would rather he depart, offering him money. An honest man, he refuses, wishing to earn the fare on his own. Later Colonel Cobb leaves up a poster telling about a murder Chamalis' ordered and how the Bella Donna cheats customers. Seeing it, Chamlis' henchman "Knuckles" Jacoby  shoots both the man who put it up and the publisher when he tries to defend him. Dying, Cobb orders his assistant to print the truth. A vigilante group is formed and soon hangs Knuckles. Devastated on hearing the news of Cobb's death, Mary re-acknowledges her love for Carmichael, and works the roulette table so that he wins back the gold he previously lost. Chamalis finds out and is angry with her. He sets out to kill Carmichael, who is actually hiding in Mary's bedroom. The lovers decide clandestinely to leave together. They find a secret rowboat and attempt to board the ship in the harbor. It is a foggy night, and they have trouble seeing, but easily hear Chamalis pursuing them. He shoots and injures Carmichael and finally discovers them hiding beneath a pier. Mary begs him, as proof of his love for her, not to kill Carmichael. Chamalis agrees, but in an act of greater love allows her to go with him. A posse then arrives to punish Chamalis for all his crimes.
