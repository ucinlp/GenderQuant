Professor Fromentin's inventions are about to start a new era in anti-aircraft warfare. No fighter aircraft hitherto known stands a chance against his trail-blazing self-designed unmanned aerial vehicles. Secret services all over the world are determined to either obtain Fromentin's knowledge or to make dead sure nobody else does. But Fromentin refuses to sell and consequently several attempts are made on his life. Nick Carter has a personal interest in protecting the professor who was a good friend of his father. This is harder than it looks because the professor's entourage includes at least one traitor. An international network of terrorists eventually conceives a plan to take advantage of this situation. They intend to capture the professor and then to sell him to the highest bidder. Nick Carter has to apply advanced gadgets and sometimes also just his fists, thus refuting all criminal tactics until the scientist can continue searching in freedom and peace.
