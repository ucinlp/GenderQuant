{{Plot}} A volcanologist and his graduate students believe that all of the volcanoes in the world are going to erupt and kill every living thing on the planet. They try to convince the government that their theory is true while also trying to figure out how to stop it. Dormant for 700 years, the Trollsvatn volcano in Iceland suddenly erupts and kills a USGS survey team. Volcanology professor Dr. Peter Shepherd  takes four of his graduate students to study Grímsvötn, a dormant volcano near the first. It also erupts suddenly, but the group is able to escape. Shepherd is convinced it is not a coincidence and visits Dr. Oscar Vallian , a wheelchair-using volcanologist who recently quit working for the USGS. He explains that many dormant volcanoes have started to erupt around the world. In the past, Vallian had formulated a theory known as Exodus, in which all 1,500 of the Earth's volcanoes could erupt within a short period of time. Vallian leaves for Honshu, Japan, to be on the front lines when Mount Fuji erupts. Shepherd goes to Washington, D.C. to explain the Exodus theory and the need to stop it. Dr. William Kincaid , the head of the USGS, hates O'Neil  and Shepherd, and is given the task of reviewing their data. He promises the president's representative Stephen Daugherty  to disprove the theory. Shepherd leaves knowing nothing will happen, returning to his students to explain the government will not act unless they get proof. Shepherd's soon to be ex-wife Natalie , a Park Ranger, arrives at work at Yellowstone National Park to be told that Old Faithful hasn't done anything for the last day. In Honshū, Vallian and his companion Melanie  wait for Fuji's expected eruption. Shepherd makes plans with his students to go to South America to check out another volcano that should be next in the list. That night, Shepherd calls his estranged wife. During the call, she mentions fire season has started in the middle of winter. Shepherd does not mention the volcano issues. The next day, Fuji erupts, destroying much of the island of Honshū and triggering large tsunamis. Vallian calls Shepherd to bid farewell before he and Melanie are swallowed up and incinerated by a pyroclastic surge. Shepherd spends the night in a bar, mourning his friend. His student Brianna  offers comfort and advice while listening to him explain how his marriage ended. In the morning, news arrives that Mount Kilimanjaro has erupted, so the group heads to Pasto, Colombia to do some investigating in a mine. A local explains that some men working in the mine were killed earlier in the week when it began to "bleed fire." Exploring the mine, Shepard's group finds massive amounts of heat, but do not realize that they had inadvertently moved from the mine's shafts into attached lava tubes. They continue their explorations and find temperatures rising incredibly fast with high levels of radiation filling the "shafts". Students Jacques  and CJ  take rock and vapor samples while Shepherd and Brianna head back. Magma falls from the ceiling and burns CJ's shoulder just as Jacques begins to suspect that they are in a lava tube. They flee, but the ceiling collapses and lava spills into the tunnel, killing Jacques. CJ survives but will require a skin graft. The news reports that Mount Etna and Mount Vesuvius have erupted and destroyed Rome. Kai  tells Dr. Shepherd that the samples from the mine were of the same composition and that someone from the USGS had hacked into their server. Kincaid admits to the hacking and stealing the data, and that he plans to present the findings to Washington as his own. During his presentation to the President and to Daugherty, Shepherd and his group interrupt and explain that they have additional evidence that Kincaid had not managed to steal. The President listens as Dr. Shepherd explains the full Exodus theory, explaining that human pollution has caused the Earth's core to heat up and expand causing all of the eruptions. Shepard also lists which volcanoes will be next. Using projections he predicts that the Earth will head into another Ice Age within 2 weeks, and explains his solution to release the Earth's pressure in a controlled manner under the ocean rather than letting the Earth choose. By using a series of nuclear warheads at strategic points within oceanic faults. After the meeting, Shepherd calls his ex-wife again and begs her to leave Yellowstone because it is the largest volcanic hotspot in North America, but she refuses. While he's on the phone, Daugherty calls to let him know that the President has approved their plan and they know have all of the resources of the CIA at their disposal to map the ocean and figure out the plan. With the coordinates set, Daugherty lets Shepherd know that he and one of the students will work hand in hand with the naval fleets from two of its flagships, the Hyperion and the Reprisal. Brianna is left at the USGS as the go between. Shepherd leaves his wedding ring with her and asks her to give it to his wife and let her know he was sorry. Shepherd boards the Hyperion, in the Pacific Rim, by jumping from a helicopter and diving down to the sub. Kai boards the Reprisal in the Atlantic. Shepherd shows the Hyperion captain where the explosions must go in the middle of the Mariana Trench. In the morning, Natalie starts packing up her campground, while another Ranger and some scientists examine Old Faithful. Kai contacts Brianna to confirm the coordinates for his sub, which will also be passed on to Russian and British sub who will aid in the attack. Meanwhile, the Hyperion gets bounced around by volcanic activity in the trench which pummels them with debris. Natalie arrives at the next set of campgrounds only to find an eruption already taking place. She turns around and heads back out. The Hyperion continues to take heavy damage, but is able to reach its coordinates and launch the warheads. It fires its first round of torpedoes, but torpedo goes off track and hits the trench wall. Two more are fired and hit successfully. The plan appears to be working, as they move on to their next targets. At the same time, the Reprisal has also fired its first four torpedoes, however it takes heavy damage from the resulting debris. Shepherd loses contact with Kai, while the Hyperion continues trying to avoid debris and hit its remaining targets. Natalie tries to flee Yellowstone as eruptions continue and multiple park visitors are killed. The President explains that a total of 44 nuclear tipped torpedoes are being fired to try and heal the Earth. As Shepherd prays for his wife, the lava flow at Yellowstone stops just before reaching Natalie and a large group of visitors. The Reprisal sinks, killing its crew and Kai. With the last of the torpedoes fired, the plan succeeds and the Hyperion is able to stabilize. The volcanoes of the world return to normal. Shepherd turns down a position as head of the USGS and reconciles with his wife.
