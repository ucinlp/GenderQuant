{{Expand section}} Psychiatrist Dr. Tony Flagg  does his friend Stephen Arden  a favor by taking on his fiancee, Amanda Cooper , as a patient. Amanda, a singer on the radio, can't seem to make a decision about Stephen's many proposals of marriage, so Tony probes her subconscious, but in the process Amanda falls in love with him. He brings her interest back to Stephen with hypnosis, but then realizes that he also loves her and tries to hypnotize her again, leading to conflict with Stephen. Five minutes away from the wedding, he breaks into her dressing room with his assistant Connors  and gets the chance to talk to her subconcious again when Stephen accidentally hits her instead of Tony. In the end, the two marry, much to the surprise of the guests.
