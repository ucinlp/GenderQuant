Mr. Nallasivam is a generous farmer who builds orphanages, schools, and hospitals and does anything he can to help people. He can be stubborn and fierce at times. He has a young daughter, Karpagam, and a son, Rajanagam. The film begins at a gathering to open a building. Sundaram, a hard-working farmer, always receives prizes for toiling hard and long at his work. After the ceremony is finished, Mr. Nallasivam invites his childhood friend, who has a daughter, Amutha, to have lunch at his house. The friend refused and said he had a lot of work to do, and jokingly called Mr. Nallasivam "country fellow".
