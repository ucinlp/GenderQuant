The film follows the perils of nightclub singer Eddie Livingston , as he pursues press agent Alison Edwards . Livingston's comic foil Tommy Sweetwood is an unsuccessful comedian who manages to offend his entire audience in one way or another with his brash, insensitive humor. Alison likes Eddie enough, but she hides a dark secret; she is a nudist! The two go back and forth playing cat and mouse as Eddie sings a series of Bobby Vinton-ish ballads like "Good Things Happen When I'm with You". One day, Tommy follows Alison on one of her clandestine weekend getaways and discovers her dirty little secret, promptly passing the information along to Eddie. Unable to cope with such a libertine concept in the conservatism of the early 1960s, Eddie flips out on Alison during a radio broadcast. But Tommy has been enlightened by his visit to the nudist camp, and plays Cupid for the star-crossed lovers, and the three soon decide to spend the next weekend at the camp. As with almost any non-nudists in these films upon first trying nudism, Eddie embraces the healthy purity of such an Edenic way of life, and becomes a firm believer. This, of course, is parlayed through a lengthy set of sequences showing our heroes enjoying a smattering of activities nude, such as horseback riding, yachting, swimming and water skiing . The "star power" of Goldilocks extends to the appearance of former light heavyweight champion Joey Maxim as the owner of his eponymous nightclub where Eddie and Tommy perform. Maxim was so unprepared for his role as himself that he would read his lines off his shirt cuff.
