Best friends Marcus and Greg and their girlfriends, Nina and Liz, are driving in the Australian outback. The group is friendly, but there is some unsettled business between them, not far beneath the surface. On the road, they are confronted by a road train, a massive truck hauling two large trailers. Seemingly preying upon them, the monstrous vehicle comes up behind their SUV and seems to intentionally push them off the road, causing them to crash. Marcus, Nina, and Liz manage to escape unharmed but Greg's arm is broken. Their vehicle wrecked, and one of their party injured, the friends seek help from the driver of the truck, which has stopped some distance up the road. The truck's cab is empty, however, and the driver nowhere to be found. As they search for the driver, Greg begins to feel drawn to the truck, especially its hood ornament, which is a bust of Cerberus . Distant gunshots are heard, and a distant, crazed figure in the bush screams and runs towards them. With no time to discuss their options, the friends commandeer the truck in a panic and drive off. As they drive through the outback, the truck's radio comes on by itself and lulls the four to sleep, leaving the truck to drive itself off the road and up a hill. Liz goes off in search of a shack she claims she saw while driving. Marcus attempts to turn the truck around, but it now refuses to start. He goes with Liz to get help while Nina looks after Greg at the truck. Meanwhile, Nina discovers the truck's fuel tanks are empty. She looks over the trailers and finds a large pipe hanging underneath the trailer, filled with a mysterious red goo. Greg, tormented by visions of Cerebus snarling and barking, finds a key to the trailers in the back of the cab. He sneaks off and enters the rearmost trailer; the trailer's door closes itself behind him. Nina, returning to the truck's cab to find it empty, searches for Greg in the wilderness. Marcus and Liz have a disagreement and split up; Liz wanders off into the desert alone in search for the shack while Marcus stays on the road. The truck's driver, carrying a gun, catches up with Marcus. Clearly upset, he demands to know what the friends have done with the truck. The two struggle as the camera looks away, and a gunshot is heard. Liz finds the shack, but it is rundown and abandoned. Inside, she finds unlabelled cans also containing a mysterious red goo. Desperate for water, she drinks some. but after finding a pile of worn shoes, one still with a foot in it, she panics and runs back to the truck. There, she finds Nina. Marcus and Greg are gone, presumably dead, and something is clearly very wrong - the women panic and try and start the truck again to drive back to civilization, but they are attacked by a bewildered Marcus, who is now wearing the clothes of the truck driver and carrying his gun. The women overpower him, tying him onto the over-sized spare tire cage below one of the trailers. After that, they attempt to get the truck moving again. Greg emerges from the trailers, looking much stronger than he went in, and finds Marcus. Marcus tells him they have to get away from the truck. Ignoring his warning, Greg unties Marcus and kills him. Greg, now seemingly possessed by an unknown force, vanishes again. Liz tries to spot  from the rear of the truck as Nina backs the truck up, but eventually hides to continue drinking more of the mysterious red liquid. As she does, she's confronted by Greg, who seduces her into the rear trailer. Nina, unable to see Liz, exits the truck cab and is confronted by Greg. Greg attempts to seduce Nina into the rear trailer, but Nina is suspicious. Once she hears Liz cry for help from inside the trailer, she pushes Greg in, latches the door, and padlocks it, securing Greg inside. Alone, Nina succeeds in turning the road train around and returns to the main road. There, she stops the truck and considers its trailers. She enters the forward trailer and is horrified to discover that it is an abattoir, grinding human bodies, including Marcus's, into the red goo that fuels the truck. Panicked, she returns to the cab and drives off. Moments later, she spots a car and camping trailer ahead and prepares to signal them for help. But the truck radio turns on again by itself and during the distraction, Greg and Liz break into the cab. As the three fight, Greg, taking control, rams the truck into the car, destroying its trailer and half crushing it. Liz is thrown from the cab. Nina is knocked out. When Nina awakens, she finds Greg dragging Liz's body to the trailer. Greg again tries to persuade her to enter the trailer, claiming they have a magnificent opportunity. Nina plays along only long enough to escape and run off. She runs off into the woods with Greg in pursuit. He catches her, but she manages to grab the truck driver's gun and she empties the magazine into his chest, four shots, killing him. As she emerges out of the woods, she spots the couple from the wrecked car searching the truck. She runs toward them, screaming warnings. But the couple, having been run off the road, hearing distant gunshots, and seeing a crazed, screaming figure running towards them, commandeer the truck and drive off. Nina watches in horror as the truck speeds away to begin a new cycle.
