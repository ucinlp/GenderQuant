On one such occasion, Rishi takes her to Mumbai for dinner. Anjali fakes off the issue with her father that she was with her friend. But unfortunately, Vishwanath calls that friend up when Anjali was missing. He tells him that Anjali went to Mumbai with someone called Rishi. This is enough for Vishwanath's suspicion to rise that Anjali has fallen in love. He asks Rishi to prove his worth, and asks him in some way to earn any money so that he can support Anjali who he has brought up in riches. When Rishi refuses to comply, he gives Rishi one crore rupees to forget her daughter. Rishi takes it and later gives it back, insulting Viswanath, and tries to prove that his love is greater than everything. To retaliate, Vishwanath insults Rishi's family by getting a beggar for marriage with Rishi's sister to try to convey to them the pain he must feel. Rishi then creates a scene in Viswanath's office. Anjali starts to show more feelings for Rishi. Worried, Vishwanath tries to set Anjali's marriage with another guy. In the end, the marriage fails and Anjali marries Rishi...
