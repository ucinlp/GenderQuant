The title is suggestive of a grandmother-grandson relationship. Yedukondalu (played by comedian [[Ali  is looked after by his grandmother Gundamma  after his mother's death while his father, Srisailam  is an alcoholic. Ali falls in love with Mahalakshmi , whose father Neelakanta  is a greedy person and wants his would-be son-in-law to own a hotel. With the help of his grandmother  Yedukondalu sets up a hotel. Neelakatna reluctantly agrees to the match but later calls off the wedding after receiving a better marriage proposal for his daughter. Yedukondalu is beaten up and dumped on the railway track. Injured, he nevertheless rescues a girl  stuck in a car on the tracks. Together they join hands to set up a successful restaurant. Yedukondalu then distances himself from Mahalakshmi. Whether he ends up with her makes up the rest of the story.
