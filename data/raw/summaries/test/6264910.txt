In Monte Athena, Italy, young lovers Lysander  and Hermia  escape into the forest to escape the strict instructions from Hermia's father that she must be betrothed to Demetrius , another young man who loves her. Demetrius follows them, having been made aware of the plan by Helena , a young woman who is desperately in love with him. Once in the forest, they wander into the fairy world, ruled by King Oberon  and Queen Titania , two sparring local deities. Oberon and his servant sprite Puck  cause mayhem among the lovers with a magic potion that causes both Lysander and Demetrius to fall in love with Helena, leading to a rift between all four that culminates  in a mud-wrestling scene. Meanwhile, Oberon bewitches Titania with the same potion, causing her to fall in love with a local weaver and amateur actor, Nick Bottom , whom Puck has furnished with the head of an ass. Titania woos Bottom in her bower, attended by fairies. Oberon tires of the sport and puts all to rights, pairing Lysander back with Hermia and Demetrius with Helena, and reconciling with his own queen, Titania. In the final part, Bottom and his troupe of "rude Mechanicals" perform their amateur play, based on the tragedy of Pyramus and Thisbe, before Duke Theseus , his wife Hippolyta , and the court, unintentionally producing a comedy.
