In New Orleans a serial killer wearing a welder's mask strikes during the Mardi Gras festival. He goes into a bar and asks for the "most evil" prostitute he can find. He then takes her to a basement where he ties her up and cuts off her limbs and genitals. He then kills more prostitutes to get their hearts to sacrifice to an ancient Aztec goddess. A policeman who uses a prostitute as a lover and source of information then hunts down the killer based on her tips.
