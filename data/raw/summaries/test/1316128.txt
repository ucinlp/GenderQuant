Three young friends and aspiring rappers, Albert , Euripides , and Otis  want to make their big break. In order to get their name heard, they appeal to local crime kingpin and nightclub owner Gusto , but during a failed meeting the police rush in and throw Gusto in jail. Gusto believes that the trio set him up, swearing revenge when he is released from prison. However, while Gusto is locked up, Albert steals his criminal background and identity to become "MC Gusto", and forms the hardcore gangsta rap group CB4 . CB4 becomes the hottest band on the charts with controversial hits like "Sweat of my Balls" and "Straight Outta Locash", and their rise to fame is documented by an aspiring director  and his cameraman. As an ambitious politician  seeks to shut them down for obscenity charges, tensions between the group arise over one member's gold-digging groupie girlfriend . The group breaks up, and the strain of the charade takes its toll on Albert's family life and relationship with his wholesome girlfriend Daliha . Gusto eventually escapes from prison and sets out to get revenge by making Albert appear to really be the criminal he pretends to be, but the plan backfires and Gusto is sent to prison for life. Albert gives up the pretense of being a gangsta, and the group has a happy reunion tour.
