Steven Miller wakes up one day to go fishing with one of his students at the college. However Steven has a flat tire and can't make it. His student goes out to fish along with his dog down by the river. As he is throwing his line out into the water, a shark knocks him down and eats the bottom half of the student. Steven sees the body by the beach and thinks the death might be from a Mountain Lion. When he goes home, his son asks him if he can go to the arcade for a while. While at the arcade, 3 of his friends come up to him to remind him about going tubing over the weekend. The son tells his father that they are all going hiking instead of going tubing because Steve hates the water. Then at the gate that stops things from the ocean coming into the river, the gate is jammed and the gate operator goes down and tries to fix it. The shark then grabs him with his teeth and eats him. His partner reports that the operator is missing to the police but they can do nothing. That night, a bum named Sarge spots a shark swimming through the river and he runs in the bar and everyone laughs at him. The next day, Steven goes to find the sheriff. He tells the Sheriff that there is a shark in the river. The sheriff does not believe him and drives off. Later, a couple goes jet skiing in the river. The shark then knocks the lady off the jet ski and eats her. As the husband looks for her, the shark knocks him off the jet ski and eats him too. That night Steven goes to Sarge and asks him about the shark he saw. Sarge tells him about the shark and how he was in the navy and what he did when he was younger, then the Sheriff comes up to him and asks him to come with him. The Sheriff brings him to the body of the male jet skier and the sheriff now believes that the shark is actually in the river. The next day, some friends go out on the river on their pontoon boat. The shark then hits the boat and the hits it again knocking one of the friends off. The shark sinks his teeth into him and blood comes out of the friends mouth. Steve then gets a call from his wife telling him that she found out that their son was going tubing in the river. Steven tells his wife to call the police and that he is going to find their son. The police gets her call and bring Sarge along with them. Steven then drives off and meets the police on the bridge over the river. The police give him a harness and they dangle him from the river and Steven grabs his son. However, his friends are still in the river. So they tie the rope to a tank of gas and dangle it over the water. The shark bites on the tank and Sarge gets the gun and shoots the tank. The shark blows up and Steven and his son walk to his wife and then head home.
