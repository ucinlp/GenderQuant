The spaceship AAB Gamma is dispatched from Japan to travel to Mars to investigate reports of UFOs in the area. When the Gamma nears the red planet, it comes across a mysterious UFO that sprays the Gamma with spores. The spores are taken back to Earth where one of them begins to develop. The spore grows into a giant lizard/bird-like monster dubbed Guilala. The creatuere begins a rampaging through Tokyo. It spits fireballs, feeds on nuclear fuel, turns into a giant energy ball when it wants to fly and destroys any airplanes and tanks in its path. The monster is finally defeated by jets laden bombs, which coat Guilala in a fictional substance known as "Guilalalium." The Guilalium causes the monster to shrink down to its original spore size. The government promptly launches the spore back into space, where it will circle the sun in an endless orbit.
