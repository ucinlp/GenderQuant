The movie begins as Chicago Bears running back Gale Sayers  arrives to team practice as an errant punt was sent to Sayers. Running back Brian Piccolo  comes by to retrieve the ball, as Sayers flips the ball to him. Sayers eventually heads into the team headquarters to meet with coach George Halas. During practice, Piccolo struggled, compared to Sayers, who also pranked him by placing mashed potatoes on his seat while Piccolo was singing his alma mater's fight song. Afterwards, Sayers and Piccolo were placed into the same room, a rare sign during this time. Eventually, in a game against the San Francisco 49ers, Sayers excelled, until he injured his knee. To aid in Sayers's recovery, Piccolo brings a weight machine to aid in working his knee. In Sayers's place, Piccolo rushed for 160 yards in a 17-16 win over the Los Angeles Rams, and was given the game ball. Piccolo later challenged Sayers to a running race across the park, where Sayers later stumbled. In their room, Halas handed Piccolo the starting fullback position, and both Piccolo and Sayers would eventually excel in games against teams like the Pittsburgh Steelers. However, in a different game, Piccolo started to show signs of a decline in performance. Eventually, before a loss, Halas revealed to Sayers that Piccolo has cancer. In an emotional speech to the team, Sayers stated that they will give Piccolo the game ball. After a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Sayers visited Piccolo's wife, who stated that Piccolo has a tumor. After he was awarded the George S. Halas Most Courageous Player Award, Sayers dedicated his speech to Piccolo. In a call, Sayers mentioned that he gave Piccolo a pint of blood to aid him, who was in critical condition. Piccolo would die with his wife by his side, and the movie ends with a flashback of Piccolo and Sayers running through the park.
