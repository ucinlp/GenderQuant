The New York Panthers ice hockey team is struggling in the standings. A scouting team headed by Kelly  heads to Maine where they've heard of a promising former amateur player. He turns out to be John Hanson , now a chicken farmer. He does not wish to return to the game, but when he learns how much money he can make, he agrees solely so he can make enough to upgrade his farm. His skills make him an instant sensation, but as the team heads toward the championship series, he runs afoul of crooked gamblers and the beautiful woman  they tempt him with.
