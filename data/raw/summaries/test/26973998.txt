A married couple enjoy engaging in S&M sexual behavior, and the wife, Yuri, asserts, "The ultimate SM play is death." After her husband dies, supposedly accidentally, Yuri is left alone, grieving and self-destructive. Her mental state deteriorates as she watches and masturbates joylessly to the home-made SM videos she made with her husband. In the film's climax, Yuri goes to a public square, nude and bound, and pleads with passing strangers to aid her masturbation.<ref nameWeisser|firstYuko Mihara Weisser|title 471|yearVital Books : Asian Cult Cinema Publications|location1-889288-52-7}}
