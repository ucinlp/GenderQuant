The film takes its story from oral traditions of Shandong. A bumbling villager, Niu'er , is charged with caring for a Dutch cow, considered an object of awe to the village given its larger size and ability to produce large amounts of milk. When the village is bombed by the Japanese, Niu'er flees from his home, only to return to devastation and a mass grave. The cow, however, has survived, and the two make their way across the landscape, avoiding Japanese troops and hungry survivors before eventually meeting with the Communist 8th Route Army.
