Evan Danielson  is a very successful stockbroker, who had been working at the same securities firm for eight years as their top account manager, that is until Johnny Whitefeather  was hired as his rival. Whitefeather seems to have the whole company under some spell as he spiels his nonsensical idioms filled with Native American mumbo jumbo. These top executives seem more content with chanting Indian style noises rather than listen to how they can make money through sound investments. When Evan finally discovers that his daughter, Olivia , is somehow able to tell the future within the financial world by using her 'goo-gaa' comfort blanket and her imaginary friends , he discovers he has an invaluable upper hand now at the office. In order for Evan to ask these imaginary friends any question he must travel through the imaginary world, through a dense forest, past a dragon, through caves, and even walk through France. Before, Evan who is a part-time father really had no time for his daughter, now is forced to play with her and by her rules. After only a couple of days with her, he rediscovers the inner child within himself and genuinely has a lot of fun playing these imaginary games with Olivia. Whitefeather becomes suspicious and begins to search for Evan's secret. When he finds out that Evan was just playing with a blanket, he purchased a six thousand dollar blanket and forces his son to tell him the "future" and making him extremely hyperactive by making him drink many cans of Red Bull. Whitefeather and Evan are now competing for the position of heading the Western division of the company D.D.E. In order to be prepared for the most important presentation of his life, Evan must once again invoke the use of the Goo-Gaa blanket and meet up with the princesses. The only problem is that Olivia is spending the night at her friends house, and there is no way for Evan to obtain said Goo-Gaa. Also, the presentation showdown will be held on Saturday, the day of Olivia's class play. So Evan is able to get the Goo-Gaa from his daughter, later Evan's daughter is seen crying because he isn't really caring about her, only her blanket. Evan returns home and tries to get the princesses' attention. Evan then starts working on his presentation, and later couple hours past, and he stretches, then the Goo-Gaa falls on the floor, but he continues working without noticing that it fell. Evan decides to go to the presentation instead of his daughter, Olivia's class play. Johnny starts off with his presentation, but his idea was too crazy for the owner of the company, so Johnny leaves without getting the position. Then it's Evan's turn, he gets up and just when he is about to present, he decides to go to Olivia's class play, and leaves the presentation. Evan starts driving over to the class play, and he starts changing into a costume. Back at the class play, Olivia is about to sing her solo part, then all of a sudden Evan appears in a king costume, and Olivia starts singing, and she is happy that he came. After the class play, Evan starts talking to Olivia about how sorry he is for using her blanket, and not caring about her, and for using the princesses for the wrong reason.. Meanwhile the owner of the company, D.D.E. appears, and wants to talk to Evan. He and Evan talk, and he decides to give the position to Evan because of how much Evan cares about his family. Evan accepts. Evan goes back to Olivia, and it is time to say good-bye to the princesses, both of them start waving, and a gust of wind blows, and some leaves are in a shape of a person, and the princesses go off to the sky. Evan, Olivia's mother, and Olivia leave happy.
