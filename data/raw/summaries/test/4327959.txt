Cast  Initial Screenings   In addition to the unique nature of the creation of this film, the distribution method is one of the first for a first-run, American-made motion-picture. The movie was distributed for free using BitTorrent technology. This will allow everyone to download a copy for themselves. Of course, with the DivX encoded file reaching almost 1 gigabyte in size, it may not be practical for everyone to download it. Probably because of this, the movie was added to Google Video so it could be viewed without download, or downloaded with a smaller file size.
