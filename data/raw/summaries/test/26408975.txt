{{Expand section}} The film begins in the year 2073; Nicholas Sinclair, and his time-travel research colleagues, are all dying from a unknown virus. He travels back to 1973 through a time warp to find and retrieve a defective robotic probe. The real trouble begins when his colleagues send a probe after him. This creates a time paradox and causes alternate timeline to develop in which humanity is being wiped out by the virus. they are also waging a war against a never-ending supply of robots. The robots are actually A.P.E.X extermination units being constantly sent back over and over to erase the paradoxical timeline.
