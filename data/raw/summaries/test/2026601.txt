The movie begins with a clown  whose wife  and stripper girlfriend  just discovered each other's existence. When his wife is jailed for trying to run him over, the stripper, the clown and his partner  contact a bail bondsman  whose wife just left their sickly son Timmy  in his care. On the way, they are accosted by a crazed drug addict named Slovo  who is hit by a car soon after. At the jail, the five meet up with an angry record producer  and the girlfriend he believes to be pregnant  whom he plans to make a star, despite her protestations of not having any talent. Also along for the ride are two priests , one of whom has begun to doubt the wisdom of the Roman Catholic Church, and who are trailing to bail out a third priest  who was goaded into a fight by the proprietor of a strip club . When the nine characters intersect, they discover that Timmy has a defective kidney and is slowly dying. However, he has just been paged, as there is a donor at the hospital: Slovo. The three caring characters immediately take Timmy to the hospital, with the others in pursuit. By the time they arrive, Slovo has partially recovered and has escaped to wander the streets, cheerfully ignoring his internal bleeding, and must be tracked down before both he and Timmy die.
