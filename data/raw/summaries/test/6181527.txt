Kicked out of jail days before the guard/inmate ball hockey final, Ricky and Julian return to Sunnyvale trailer park with a plan for The Big Dirty, the largest heist of their long criminal history: a scheme to steal vast quantities of change – since it is untraceable. Meanwhile, Ricky is pondering taking his relationship with longtime girlfriend Lucy to the next level when he discovers that Lucy has some newly enhanced breasts and a job at the "gentleman’s club." Later, while visiting the club, Julian meets and falls for the beautiful featured dancer Wanda, and the boys have their first encounter with Sonny, the dangerous owner of the club. As the day of the Big Dirty approaches, the boys train less-than-able assistants Cory and Trevor. But before their plan can succeed, they must survive shootouts and face down drunken trailer park supervisor Mr. Lahey and his cheeseburger-loving assistant Randy in a deadly game of Sunnyvale Chicken.
