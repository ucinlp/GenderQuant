The story takes place in a small village surrounded by hills and valleys. Young Pappu, a teenager, awaiting school results to go to college, has plenty of time on hand. His trouble is adolescence, but neither his mother nor his aunt can diagnose his affliction. Everything around him excites and stimulates his sexual curiosity. Twenty plus Rathi, the girl next door, has been chechi  to him since he was a child. Unaware of the stirrings of his desire, she dismisses his first overtures to her as boyish pranks. But soon her feelings change. She is sympathetic to the boy's confusion and goes to the sarppakkavu  to keep a midnight date with Pappu. It storms and thunders while Pappu makes love to Rathi. Only then do the storms-- the one tormenting him inside his mind and the other raging thunderously on the outside, subside. Aghast at what has happened, Rathi stumbles to her feet but is bitten by a cobra but she goes back to her house and suffers in silence in order to prevent any scandal and the delay costs her life. Next morning Pappu leaves home for college and his new life.
