Chantal is a young, naive and innocent woman from the American Heartland who arrives in Hollywood, California to pursue her dream of becoming a rich and famous actress. Almost immediately, Chantal begins to fall victim to the lower depths of Los Angeles. After renting a bad room, Chantal gets mugged in a local park, then falls prey to a sleazy female photographer who forces her to perform pornography. She deals with seedy, would-be Casting Directors who want her body more than her acting talent, a slimy hotel manager and more. Eventually Chantal meets Tracy, a prostitute who helps her though the dangerous and ruthless side of Hollywood life. However, Chantal, who is too innocent and naive to handle her new life, slowly slides toward the abyss, never able to pull back.
