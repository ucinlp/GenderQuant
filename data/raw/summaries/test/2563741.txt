The musician Aurelius Rex and his wife Delia, a retired singer, are the recipients of an anniversary party in London thrown by a wealthy music promoter, Rod Hamilton. An ambitious drummer, Johnnie Cousin, wants to start his own band. He promises to persuade Delia to come out of retirement and resume performing, having been told that this is the only way his band will be backed. Told in no uncertain terms that Delia has no intention of resuming her career, Johnnie begins a series of machinations at the party designed to make Rex believe that Delia has been having an affair with Cass, the band's manager. He even alters a tape recording to distort the meaning of Delia's private conversation. Johnnie's back-stabbing costs Cass his job. Delia's performance of a song, rehearsed solely for the party, furthers Rex's suspicions that she is unhappy at home. Rex assaults Delia and makes public accusations about her fidelity. In the ensuing conversations, everyone, including Johnnie's neglected wife Emily, eventually realizes that Johnnie has fabricated the entire story. It is implied that Delia and Rex resume their relationship.
