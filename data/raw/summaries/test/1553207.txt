United States Marine Corps Major Benson Winifred Payne , a hardened Marine, returns from a very violent but successful drug raid in South America, only to find out that he has again been denied his long-hoped-for promotion to the grade of Lieutenant Colonel. Instead, Payne receives an honorable discharge on the grounds that "the wars of the world are no longer fought on the battlefield", and that his killing skills are no longer required by the U.S Marine Corps. After leaving the military, Payne finds his life as a civilian unbearable, and within days he reaches his breaking point. To help adjust, he applies for a job as a police officer. However, during the test to see how applicants handle the domestic violence in family homes disputes, he "neutralizes" the "abusive husband" by knocking him unconscious and almost killing him. Payne is arrested and placed on charges of assault and violence. His former General visits him in prison and informs Payne that he has managed to get him out of jail and to secure a military job for him. Payne arrives at Madison Preparatory School in Virginia, and is informed by the principal ([[William Hickey  that his job is to train the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps. These "green boys"  are a disorderly group of delinquents and outcasts who have placed last in the Virginia Military Games eight years running. When Payne sees his company, he declares his intention that they will win the Games at all costs, and immediately sets about establishing order and discipline, making no exceptions for various handicaps that the cadets have . His punishment methods cause him to clash with Emily Walburn , the School's counselor. Walburn tries to make Payne more empathetic, particularly towards six-year old orphan Tiger , but without much success. Chafing under Payne's iron hand, the cadets, led by chief mischief Alex Stone  make a series of attempts to get back at Payne, or force him to leave. Some of the schemes include giving him a laxative-loaded cupcake, attempting to portray Payne in a photo sleeping with one of the boys, and hiring a biker to beat up Payne. None of the cadets' plots succeed. Things come to a head when Payne offers to leave if they bring him the Military Games trophy. The cadets assume he means for them to steal the trophy from rival Wellington Academy, and they attempt to do so. However, Payne places an anonymous call to Wellington, leading to the boys' being ambushed by Wellington cadets before they can collect the trophy. The next day, Payne is confronted by Stone about the sabotaged trophy mission, but Payne tells him it was not about fair or unfair, but about achieving the objective. Payne asks Stone if he wants the trophy, and Stone replies that he does. Payne then tells Stone that he will show him how to earn it, and starts training the cadets for the games. Finding motivation in the prospect of winning the trophy and of finally being rid of Payne, the cadets throw themselves into Payne's grueling training program. Payne begins to earn some grudging respect from the corps by saving Stone from his abusive stepfather  by beating him up and sending him away from the school's premises, and saving Tiger from his nightmares and a "bogeyman" in the closet. Payne takes his gun and shoots the closet. Tiger and Emily look him in shock, but he only tells Tiger, "If he's still in there, he sure ain't happy." The day before the Games, the corps is in good form and ready for the competition. However, Payne's former General arrives with a request for Payne to return to the Marines so he can assist in Bosnia. His proposed deployment means he will miss the Military Games. This has a demoralizing effect on the cadets, but they decide to compete anyway. Payne initially follows his orders and sets off for his new engagement. But as he waits for his train, he has a vision of himself with Walburn and Tiger, barbecuing in the front yard of their dream home. He realizes that his desire to be with Walburn and Tiger is greater than his desire to return to military action. Aborting his mission, Payne heads back to see the Games, as well as Walburn and Tiger. At the Games, the Madison Corps are holding their own until Dotson, one of Madison's former cadets, trips Stone during a race, injuring Stone's leg. Stone manages to get to his feet and hobble across the finish line, finishing in second place. This foul play sparks an all-out brawl between the teams that threatens to get them disqualified. Payne arrives at the last minute and sticks up for his team. Because Stone is injured and out of the competition, Payne appoints young Tiger to lead the squad. The group executes an unorthodox but entertaining routine which wins them the trophy, with Tiger at the front. Stone is personally awarded the Individual Cadet Achievement trophy. Three months later, on the first day of the new school year, Payne has resumed being an instructor to the cadets, with Stone as squad leader. Payne's demeaner has softened quite a bit, declaring himself not only their commanding officer but also their friend. However, when a new blind cadet taunts Payne, Payne orders Tiger to get him his field knife, which he uses to shave the cadet – and his seeing-eye dog – bald, showing that sterness hasn't quite left him. The film fades out to the sound of Payne's laughter.
