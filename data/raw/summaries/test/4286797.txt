The film is about Dr. Siddharth Sinha  and his son Dr. Akash Sinha . Both work in the same hospital founded by Siddharth. Siddharth wishes to run a state of the art hospital but his work and profession means he dedicates his time to his patients. Soon enough Dr. Neha Mathur  walks into Akash's life and they eventually fall in love with each other. Eventually Siddharth dies and Akash sets on to fulfill his father's dream. The arrival of Sonia Kapoor  changes everything between Neha and Akash. Sonia is a rich and arrogant schizophrenic woman who is used to having things her own way and it is not long before she wants Akash for herself. She decides that since Akash is the man for her, she can latch on to him by literally 'buying' his love through financial agreement. The agreement states that on marrying Soniya, her father Gulshan Kapoor  will help finance the hospital project. As fate would have it, Siddharh Sinha expires in his attempt to bring a child injure in an accident to his hospital. His last wish is for the hospital to be properly completed. Akash, now burdened with the increasing debts to purchase equipment for the hospital, cannot arrange for further funds. Over a broken heart, he agrees to marry Sonia, in order to set up the hospital, and thus fulfilling his father's final wish. Neha understands this and agrees to break up with Akash, but offers to continue working in the same hospital because she is a professional and dedicated person. After the marriage, Sonia starts suspecting Akash is having an affair with Neha, and starts annoying both of them. She cannot stand Neha still working at the hospital, and keeps coming up with all kinds of reasons to get Neha out. In one such quest, she is involved in a fatal accident and has serious damage to her brain. Now Akash has to operate on her. For a moment he is in a dilemma, because curing Sonia would mean facing her problems again. But he decides that he is a doctor, and a doctor should never discriminate patients, but his job is to simply save lives. Akash operated Sonia and she is fully recovered. Sonia comes to know that she was operated by Akash, even when she created all kinds of problems for him. Wisdom dawns on Sonia and she asks for Akash's pardon, and gives him divorce and walks out of his life, freeing him to marry and settle down with Neha.
