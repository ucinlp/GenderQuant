The plot was loosely based on the novel Passion Flower Hotel by Rosalind Erskine . It involves various attempts by the girls to lose their virginity with the boys in the school across the lake. It begins with the girls comparing breast size and ends with a wild party with a Bill Haley classic "See You Later Alligator" as the background theme. During this scene Deborah Collins  finally has sex with Frederick Sinclair  in a romantic setting. She is expelled and the other girls feel that everything will be so sad and boring without her. She informs the headmistress that she will tell everyone that the school is run by disreputable teachers if she expels the other girls. She departs on a train after kissing Frederick goodbye.
