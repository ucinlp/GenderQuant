When police officer Moe Finkelstein is ordered to serve as a bodyguard to German consul Karl Baumer by the mayor of New York City, he turns in his badge because the man is a Nazi. The mayor tells Moe although he personally is opposed to Adolf Hitler and his regime, he is under special orders from the Berlin government to halt demonstrations in against Nazi sympathizers and organizers, and he feels he will demonstrate the American system of democracy if he obeys their wishes.  Moe quickly discovers Baumer is in trouble with Berlin for having squandered money intended to finance sabotage. His secretary, Baron Max von Alvenstor, has become disenchanted with his boss and refuses to stall the delivery of a damaging financial report to Berlin. Baumer's Czechoslovakian wife Sophie confesses to Moe she loathes her husband and married him only to secure her father's release from prison. Also at odds with Baumer is Otto Horst, who has been ordered to procure false identification cards for German saboteurs assigned to blow up an American port at the end of a radio broadcast delivered by Hitler. Under orders from Berlin to dispense with Horst, Baumer plots to frame Max for the man's murder and tries to enlist Sophie's help, but she warns Horst of the scheme, so he begins to carry a gun for protection. While listening to the radio speech with her husband, Horst, and Max, Sophie grabs Horst's gun and kills Baumer. Max urges Sophie to escape before anyone sees her. Moe discovers the body and begins to question suspects, including Sophie, who readily confesses to the crime, but Max insists it was he who killed Baumer. Moe reveals Baumer not only was shot, but stabbed and poisoned as well. Meanwhile, Max rushes to the port where the saboteurs are concealed and orders them to dismantle the bomb. With only minutes to spare, the bomb is dismantled and the saboteurs are captured. Returning to the consulate, Max identifies Horst as an accomplice to the saboteurs, and Horst is arrested. A coroner's report determines Baumer died because he accidentally drank from a glass he had laced with poison intended for Max.
