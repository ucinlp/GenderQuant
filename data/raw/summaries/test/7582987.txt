 Most of the plot is unknown; The Ghost of Slumber Mountain originally took up 3000 feet of film, equivalent to approximately 30 minutes, but Dawley cut it to only 11 minutes in length, though a restored version runs approximately 19 minutes. Why he butchered the film to such a degree is unknown. In the version available today, Holmes  is telling his nephews about an adventure he had in the woodlands around Slumber Mountain, near the Valley of Dreams. He found the cabin belonging to the late hermit Mad Dick, who Holmes's friend Joe once saw carrying a strange telescope-like instrument. That night, Holmes investigated the cabin and found the instrument. Upon doing so, the ghost of Mad Dick  instructs him to use it to look on the peak of Slumber Mountain. When he does, he seemingly looks back into the past, seeing a Tyrannosaurus and a Triceratops doing battle. The Tyrannosaurus proves triumphant, and after killing the Triceratops, somehow breaks the time barrier  and begins chasing Holmes. But it was all just a dream...
