Wealthy Mr. Bullion  is up in arms when his eccentric wife  informs him that she wants to adopt a refugee, the latest socio-political movement. After taking a trip to his dentist , Mr. Bullion meets the Stooges, inept window washers who act as interim dentists when Bullion enters the office demanding medical attention. After pulling his bridge-work out completely , they try to put it back into his mouth with cement. However, the cement hardens before they have a chance to put the tooth back in, so they decide to blast. The dentist arrives back in his office as the dynamite is lit. He calls out to the Stooges, who notice him and run off. The dynamite goes off and Mr. Bullion wakes up, noticing that the pain in his tooth is gone. He heads back to his car and notices the Stooges hiding inside. He inquires as to what they are up to, and Moe says that they are "refugees." Mr. Bullion then has a very nasty idea to disabuse his wife of her philanthropic notion: pass these three nitwits off as refugee children. Mrs. Bullion is naturally thrilled at the sight of the Stooges , but she ends up regretting their adoption after a party is thrown in their honor â€” and Mr. Bullion is beginning to regret concocting this scheme to begin with. The festivities are interrupted when an angered Mr. Bullion chases after the Stooges with an axe.
