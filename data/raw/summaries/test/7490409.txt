A special opera performance is held for the Little King and his queen, but the diminutive monarch is soon bored by the music. He sneaks out in search of some new entertainment, and spots a sign for Betty Boop at the local vaudeville theatre. After some difficulties getting a pretzel from a vendor, the curtain comes up on Betty's Wild West show. Betty performs several tricks with her horse, entrancing the monarch. He joins Betty on stage for a song and dance number, just in time to be caught by the angry queen. The monarchs leave in the royal carriage, with Betty  holding the Little King's hand.
