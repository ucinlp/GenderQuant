A stage magician conjures up a dove which he then places in a box with a set of clothes. A boy appears from the box, who the magician divides into two with an axe. The two boys squabble and the magician transforms one into a paper tissue which he shreds and places the other back in the box. The magician then destroys the box with a hammer to show the boy has vanished. The boy reappears and is transformed into flags. The magician then disappears in a puff of smoke only to re-enter through a door to take his bow.
