The plot centers on the title character, a mad scientist, Dr. XXX, who has captured Mickey's dog, Pluto. Mickey tries to rescue him before the doctor can perform his grotesque experiment: attaching Pluto's head to the body of a chicken in order to "find out if the end result will bark or crow or cackle". Mickey battles his way through booby traps and animated skeletons before eventually getting caught and strapped onto a table to get cut open by a buzzsaw. The audience then find Mickey in bed and woken up by a fly, whose buzzing resembles the whirring of the spinning blade. Not yet realizing the episode was only a nightmare, Mickey shouts for Pluto, who eagerly jumps onto Mickey's bed.
