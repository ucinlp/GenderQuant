A witness against the Mafia is being secretly held until the trial when a violent attempt against her that kills several of her guards is made. She disappears and Chris Lecce  and Bill Reimers  are called upon due to their excellent surveillance record, to stake out a lakeside home where she is believed to be. Unlike their earlier stakeout, this time they are accompanied by Gina Garrett  from the DA's office and her pet rottweiler 'Archie', covered as husband, wife and son. The film ends when Tony the hitman gets shot and killed by Chris and Bill, after he falls in the pool with Gina. Both of them are congratulated as heroes by the F.B.I. Chris returns to his apartment to say goodbye to Maria, but decides she wants to marry him. Bill, meanwhile, sees both of them making love from a patrol car.
