Pily lives a pastoral life at the bottom of Oregon's Willamette River. He tends to his underwater crops in solitude and proves to be resourceful. His home is built from flotsam and sunken debris. Seemingly content in the world he has built for himself, Pily is actually addled by a premonition, a pre-knowledge that an invasive element is going to displace him. To prepare for the worst Pily devises an escape plan. He builds a rocketship. When Pily's anxiety gives way to the reality of an oil spill his rocketship is ready except for one part that's essential to achieve liftoff. Pily goes ashore where he finds the missing part and returns to initiate his escape. Once airborne Pily is confronted with another challenge and reaches for a solution that doesn't exist.
