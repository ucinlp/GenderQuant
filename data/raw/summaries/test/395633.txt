The Pink Panther and an unnamed painter (affectionately known as the "Little Man"Beck, Jerry.  compete over whether a house should be painted blue or pink. Each time the painter attempts to paint something blue, the panther thwarts him in a new way. At the end, the painter inadvertently turns the house and everything around it pink and the panther moves in. But just before he moves in, he paints the white man completely pink. The white man gets very upset and bangs his head against a mailbox. The Pink Panther then walks into the house as the sun sets.
