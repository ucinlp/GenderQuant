  Near a basement window are two milk bottles. Through the basement window, Tom reaches for one of the bottles and then snatches it, rushing into the living room to pour it in his bowl and drink it but Jerry also wants Tom's milk. Tom makes various attempts to catch Jerry but when they all fail, the cat dreams up a murderous plot to rid himself of his annoyance. The next scene shows Tom mixing chemicals such as moth balls, acid, and poison into his milk. When Tom stirs the deadly elixir with a spoon, the chemicals cause the spoon to dissolve. After seeing a fly taking a little sip from the bowl before crying in pain and then dropping dead, Tom becomes amazed about the effect, then carefully carries the bowl and places it outside Jerry's hole, confident that his potion works, gleefully watching Jerry about to drink from the bowl.  Seeing the bowl of milk once again, the mouse takes a couple licks, causing him to yell in pain and collapse "dead". Just before Tom can celebrate over the "dead" mouse, the full effects of the potion take place. Jerry stiffens angularly, and then rattles and pops around, in a manner reminiscent of the 1937 Mickey Mouse cartoon short The Worm Turns. Every muscle in Jerry's body quadruples in number, and he is 10 times more muscular. His muscles also becomes at least 1000 times harder then a diamond. Tom tries to smash the mouse with a phone book, but fails to even faze him; Jerry easily tears the book apart, and hitting him with the poker only leaves several mouse-shaped dents in it due to his diamond hard muscles. Tom panics and shuts the door to the living room, but Jerry's mega monster giant muscles shatter it just by walking into it. Now really scared, Tom seals himself inside a safe but Jerry's muscles easily drill through the door and pulls him out. Jerry's seemingly infinite strength allows him to smack Tom against the safe, but the potion's effects wear off and Jerry returns to his normal size. The potion's effects lasted for about a minute. After realizing he can no longer pull the cat around, he dives away from the cat and into the milk bowl where he takes a huge gulp. Tom grabs the mouse out of the bowl as he screams and Jerry's muscles grow far huger then last time. he now appears to be much more muscular, much stronger, and much harder muscles. He now grabs Tom and hurls him by his whiskers before the potion wears off. This lasted for about 10 seconds. As Jerry realizes he is normal again he simply ties Tom's whiskers and tries to drink more potion. The feline upends the bowl with his foot before the mouse can drink enough, and the chase continues across the kitchen. As Tom looks for the mouse, Jerry puts Tom's tail on a waffle iron and shuts it. The cat screams in pain and glares at his waffle-shaped tail as Jerry runs for the fridge. When Tom looks inside, Jerry boots him in and seals the door. With Tom temporarily detained inside the kitchen fridge, Jerry hurriedly attempts to make lots and lots more of the concoction himself to make him even huger, albeit with an inaccurate formula. But before Jerry has a chance to drink it, Tom escapes from the fridge and steals the milk from Jerry. The mouse tries to run away, but Tom stomps on his tail and forces his enemy to watch as he drinks the entire concoction. The cat grins evilly at Jerry. Tom begins to grow bigger and bigger, and at first it appears Jerry's done for. But then an explosion erupts from Tom, resulting him shrinking to a smaller size than Jerry. This lasted for about 3 seconds. Jerry snatches his tail from Tom's foot, grabs Tom's tail, and punches his face. This triggers the cat to shrink further, and Jerry snaps Tom's tail. Tom then shrinks down to the size of a fly, and Jerry starts to chase Mini-Tom with a flyswatter.
