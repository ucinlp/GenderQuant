In 1941 Lt. Commander Jeffords, an American serving with the Royal Navy is assigned to Valletta, Malta to command a flotilla of Motor Torpedo Boats for a top secret mission. Jeffords is granted permission to take his friend Chief Petty Officer Yacov, a Palestinian with him. Through scrounging spare parts from sunken craft, the battered flotilla is able to piece together three seaworthy craft. Jeffords' mission is to destroy a former Italian submarine base in Augusta, Sicily that now contains the German's Fritz X glide bombs that have been taking a heavy toll of British shipping. As the bombs are stored in former submarine pens tunnelled inside a mountain, an aerial attack is unfeasibile. It is up to Jeffords to determine how he will accomplish his mission. Off duty Jeffords meets a woman bathing in the nude who turns out to be the wife of his commanding officer. Jeffords turns down her offer of having an affair. Jefford first decides to make a reconnaissance of his target by being taken into the base by the Sicilian Resistance. Jefford's mission is successful, but at the cost of the lives of his Resistance escort. Jefford schemes to capture a German E-Boat in a manner similar to Commander Ian Fleming's Operation Ruthless. By sending a false radio message that General Alexander's airplane has gone missing in a certain area, Jefford and crew pose as survivors of the crash then capture the boat attempting to pick them up. Jefford uses the captured craft as a Trojan Horse to penetrate the harbour, having the other boats in the flotilla follow his captured craft in once the Germans have lifted their boom gate. Jefford and two others don Scuba sets to swim into the tunnels and plant explosive charges. The Allied invasion of Sicily took place in July 1943.
