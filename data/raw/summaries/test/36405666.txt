The movie follows seven friends as they start out on a road trip to Las Vegas, with Phil  recording the trip for his girlfriend Julia. The group eventually hits a road block, prompting them to take a detour that results in several flat tires. The group decides that the women will remain behind to watch the truck while the men go to look for help. The men eventually come across a rest-stop motel that sells tires, introducing themselves to the gas attendant Brad and the shop owner Steve  and Norah . Steve offers to not only fix the truck and pick up the girls, but to also allow them to stay at the motel. One of the group members, Todd , is hesitant but eventually agrees. The group stays at the motel, only for Steve, Norah, and Brad to eventually begin to murder the group. Claire  and Todd are captured by the trio and are forced to watch their friends get killed one by one. It's eventually revealed that the three murderers used to live in an orphanage run by Claire's father where they were terribly abused and beaten, with the murderers intentionally setting the group up to come by the motel.{{cite web}}
