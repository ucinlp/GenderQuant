A stagecoach is attacked by a gang led by Morgan . Sartana  arrives on the scene and kills the robbers except for Morgan who gets away. Soon after, another stagecoach is robbed and the passengers murdered by a Mexican gang, at the order of General Jose Manuel Mendoza . However, the gang is ambushed and killed by Lasky  and his men. Lasky then tells to his gang that he will meet them later. As the men are about to open the strongbox from the coach, Lasky kills them all with a Gatling gun. After opening the box and seeing it only contained rocks instead of gold, he heads into town to meet Jeff Stewal  and Alman , a politician and a banker, to collect his payment as part of an insurance fraud. After Sartana takes Lasky's money in a card game, Lasky sends Morgan, his now-partner, to kill Sartana but he fails and gets killed. Lasky then collects a gang and goes after Sartana. A shootout ensues and Sartana kills Lasky's men but allows Lasky to get away. After Lasky blackmails Stewal and Alman, the two inform Mendoza that it was Lasky who killed his men. Mendoza's men capture Lasky and try to make him talk thinking that he knows where the gold is hidden. Lasky tells him that only Sartana knows the location of the gold. Meanwhile, Stewal plans to escape with the gold, supposedly hidden in the late mayor's coffin, and Alman's wife Evelyn . After Sartana tells him that Mendoza is going to dig up the coffin with the gold and keep it all for himself, Stewal goes to check if it is true and is killed by Mendoza's men. Thinking that Mendoza now has the gold, Lasky attacks his residence and kills him and his men with his Gatling gun. Sartana also arrives and the two open the coffin and discover it is filled with rocks instead of gold. The gold has been hidden by Alman who tells his plan to his wife. Evelyn betrays and kills him, and takes Lasky to the gold, hidden in another coffin. Lasky kills Evelyn, but as Sartana arrives the two engage in a duel. Sartana kills Lasky and rides out of town with the coffin full of gold.
