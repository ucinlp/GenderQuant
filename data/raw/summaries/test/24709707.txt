In 1969, a group of friends travel through Virginia on their way to Washington, D.C. to participate in protest rallies. They hitchhike to a small rural community and meet Quintin who offers them a ride. While on the backroads, Quintin's truck overheats and they are forced to walk. As night falls they reach a farm and spend the night in a barn. The next morning, they meet the farm's inhabitants and the young travelers get the terrible feeling that something is wrong in Staunton Hill.Edit and complete by MGA & AGD....
