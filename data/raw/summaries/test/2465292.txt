Years ago, a mob boss named Lucio Malatesta  pinned the murder of rival Sammy Carboni  on another rival named Angelo Allieghieri , which led to Sammy's son Gianni vowing revenge. Frankie Delano  has spent his life safeguarding Angelo as well as Angelo's daughter, Jennifer Barrett , whose unsavory husband Kip Barrett  has had their young son Rawley  placed in a boarding school against Jennifer's wishes. Jennifer was raised by her adoptive parents Whitney Towers  and Peggy Towers  and is not aware that Angelo is her father. After Angelo is killed in a restaurant by a hit man named Bruno , Frankie introduces himself, tells Jennifer who he is and what he has been doing. A neurotic mess, Jennifer can barely handle the news that Kip is a philanderer, let alone the revelation that she is a gangster's daughter. But a DVD prepared by Angelo in the case of just such an event convinces Jennifer that it's the truth. Jennifer certainly doesn't want a full-time bodyguard, even Frankie. She ditches Kip and then falls for Italian romance novelist Marcello , who lectures at her book club. Frankie has suspicions about Marcello, but his job is to stay on the sidelines. Frankie rescues Jennifer from a string of attacks. With many of Angelo's enemies, including Lucio Malatesta, terminated, Frankie allows her to visit Italy with Marcello. But it turns out that Marcello is actually Gianni Carboni, who had Angelo killed. And now Gianni plans to kill Jennifer. It's up to Frankie to protect her one more time.
