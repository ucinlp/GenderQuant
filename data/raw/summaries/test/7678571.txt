The film follows the crew of a U-Boat, from their life the day before they ship off - meeting their family and sweethearts, spending a last night at a club, etc. Then they ship, soon boarding a Dutch merchant ship, which they inspect for contraband. The boarding of the ship is shown being done professionally and non-confrontationally. While they are boarding the ship, a Royal Navy ship spots them and tries to torpedo them, but the U-boat ends up sinking it.
