 David Copperfield is a posthumous child. He was born in Blunderstone, Suffolk, three months after the death of his father, who was also called David Copperfield. On the night of David's birth, his Great-Aunt Betsey Trotwood arrives at the Rookery - the Copperfield family home - and eagerly anticipates the birth of a baby girl. She insists that Clara Copperfield's baby must be called Betsey Trotwood Copperfield, and that she will be her godmother. However, when the delivered child turns out to be a boy, Betsey is horrified  and storms out, fuming. David grows up loved and cared for by Clara and their maid, Peggotty. When David turns eight, Clara meets and falls in love with Edward Murdstone, a stern man of whom David appears frightened and who takes an immediate dislike to David. Peggotty offers to take David with her to Yarmouth to visit her brother, Dan, and his family, and he accepts, forming a special bond with Dan's niece, Emily . When they return, David sees, to his horror, that his mother has married Murdstone. Murdstone invites his equally stern, sexist sister, Jane, to live with them, and the two Murdstones quickly dominate the household with their callous personalities. Clara briefly objects to having little to no say in the affairs of her own house, and Murdstone responds by asserting his authority and sending David to bed with no dinner, following with more strict and unfair rules upon Clara, David and Peggotty. When Murdstone canes David for falling behind in his studies , David bites him severely and as punishment, is sent to Salem House, a boarding school owned by Murdstone's abusive friend, Creakle, who torments David on Murdstone's request. David's only comfort at the school is his friendship with James Steerforth, an older student from a wealthy and influential family. David returns home for the holidays and makes amends with Murdstone, who has fathered a baby boy with Clara. Shortly after returning to Salem House, David is informed by Creakle that his mother and half-brother have died, and he returns home for the funeral. Peggotty is fired, but becomes engaged to a family friend, Mr. Barkis. With the Murdstones now in full control of the Rookery and David's future, Murdstone takes David out of Salem House and sends him to work in his black ink factory in London. Murdstone also arranges for David to live with his friend, Wilkins Micawber, who treats David like his own son, but is sent to a debtor's prison shortly afterwards. When he is released, he and his family are forced to move to Plymouth, leaving David homeless. David runs away from London to Dover, to find Betsey Trotwood in the hopes that she will take him in. Eventually he finds her, and despite Betsey's reluctance to have a boy in her house, she houses him, but writes to the Murdstones about this. Over the time, David bonds with Betsey's manservant, Mr. Dick, and Betsey herself begins to feel attachment to her great-nephew. Edward and Jane Murdstone eventually arrive to take David back, but Betsey, knowing full well of the abusive treatment Murdstone inflicted on both Clara and David, agrees to become David's legal guardian, giving Murdstone a verbal thrashing and angrily ordering him out of her house. David, now going by the name "Trotwood Copperfield", soon resumes his education at a school in Canterbury. During his time at school he lodges with Betsey's friend, Mr. Wickfield, whose daughter Agnes is roughly the same age as David. They grow up together as very close friends. On leaving school, David decides to pursue a career as a clerk and he is apprenticed to a lawyer called Mr. Spenlow. David meets Mr. Spenlow's daughter Dora and falls in love with her at first sight.  David sees Agnes at a party in London. David is less happy to see Uriah Heep, Mr Wickfield's clerk, there as well. David tells Agnes of his love for Dora before running into his old friend, Steerforth. Later Uriah discloses to David his determination to marry Agnes and threatens David not to tell Agnes or Mr. Wickfield of his intentions. Soon after, David enjoys an unplanned visit with the Micawbers before visiting Steerforth at his mother's home. David and Steerforth travel to Yarmouth where David visits Peggotty and Mr. Barkis, who has taken ill, before he and Steerforth visit the Peggotty family. Dan, Ham, Emily and Mrs. Gummidge are still living in the boat house. David learns that Ham and Emily will soon be married. Emily confides in David that she does not believe herself to be good enough for Ham, and ignores David's reassurances that Ham loves her more than anyone could. David makes one final stop to visit Peggotty and informs her that he plans on becoming engaged to Dora. Back at home, The Micawbers come for dinner, and Mr. Micawber reveals that he is now working for Uriah Heep. David reveals to Dora his love for her, and she reciprocates. On returning home that evening, he finds Aunt Trotwood on his doorstop declaring that she is ruined. David and Dora agree to a secret engagement due to his financial situation since he now without his aunt's support. David returns to Canterbury to see the Wickfields and discuss his aunt's situation, but nothing can be done. David reveals to Mr. Micawber  that he suspects Mr. Heep of trying to take control of Mr. Wickfield and his estate. David informs Agnes of his engagement to Dora. Mr. Heep declares his intentions to marry Agnes to Mr. Wickfield who responds with rage. The next day, Agnes tells David that her father has apologized to Mr. Heep since he is now too dependent on him. She appears to be reluctantly accepting of her potential marriage. Upon his next visit to Mr. Spenlow, he finds that his engagement to Dora has been discovered and not accepted and is advised to forget it. David refuses to give up Dora and tries once again to convince Mr. Spenlow of his worthiness, but discovers him dead of a heart attack. David visits Yarmouth again after he receives a letter from Peggotty, informing that Barkis's health is deteriorating. Barkis eventually dies and leaves an astronomical £3,000 in his will - £1,000 to Dan Peggotty and £2,000 to Peggotty, his wife. Ham tells David that Emily has run off with Steerforth who has been hiding in the area visiting her in secret. Dan begins a search for them, which stretches to other parts of Europe. First he, David and Peggotty inform Steerforth's mother and friend, Rosa Dartle, of his disappearance who, in response, tell them that they will not allow Steerforth to marry Emily. David learns that Mr. Spenlow is bankrupt and comforts Dora. David then begins to write and starts to sell his stories. He introduces Dora to Agnes, and Dora and David get married. They struggle as a young couple with getting the house in order. David becomes frustrated by Dora's inability to be anything more than a 'child bride', but decides to adapt himself to her and their marriage is finally as happy as it should have been. Dora soon becomes pregnant, only to suffer a miscarriage which leaves her badly weakened and eventually bedridden. David eventually finds Emily in a London slum where she is being confronted by Rosa Dartle. Steerforth had abandoned Emily and she had been living as a prostitute. Dan Peggotty also appears on the scene and promises Emily that they could start a new life as far away from Yarmouth as possible - in Australia. Emily begs David to take a letter of forgiveness to Ham, but on his arrival at Yarmouth the town is deserted and a fierce storm is raging. Steerforth appears in the water after his ship has capsized, but he and Ham drown during a rescue attempt. Back at home, Mr Micawber reveals that he has uncovered Heep's villainous scheme which has bankrupted both Mr Wickfield and Betsey Trotwood. Mr Wickfield summons the police and Heep is arrested. In thanks, Betsey Trotwood offers to pay for a fresh start for the Micawbers in Australia, but at the harbour are faced with a policeman who has a warrant for Mr Micawber's arrest - again for unpaid debts. Luckily, Betsey Trotwood arrives on the scene and pays off Mr Micawber's debts, leaving him free to board the boat to Australia. Dan and Emily join the Micawbers on the voyage to Australia. Peggotty insists that the news of Ham's death be kept from Emily until she is strong enough to cope. Dan invites his sister to join him in Australia, but she chooses to stay in England with David and Dora. Heep, meanwhile, is last seen with a group of convicts being loaded onto a boat, presumably for penal transportation. Dora eventually dies and in his grief, David disappears for three years, during which time he continues to write and has his first two books published. On David's return to Canterbury, he realizes that he loves Agnes Wickfield. After much prodding, Agnes reveals that she has always been in love with David, and even had Dora's dying approval. They are married and within a few years have two sons. David receives a visit from Mr. Peggotty. He brings news that Emily has made a full recovery from the emotional scars of her time as a prostitute, and that Mr. Micawber has established himself as a successful magistrate and bank manager. The story closes with the birth of David and Agnes's third child - a girl. Betsey Trotwood's wish finally comes true after nearly 30 years, as David decides that the baby will be christened Betsey Trotwood-Copperfield, in honour of her godmother.
