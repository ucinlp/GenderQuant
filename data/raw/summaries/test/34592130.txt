Justine is a young virgin thrown out of a French orphanage and into the depraved world of prostitution. As she slips into a life of debauchery, torture, whipping, slavery and salaciousness while her brazen, flirtatious and liberated sister Juliette ironically receives nothing but happiness and reward for her wanton behaviour. As told by the Marquis de Sade.
