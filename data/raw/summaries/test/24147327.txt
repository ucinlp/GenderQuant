Their photos, along with the rest of the victims, are even published in a newspaper they pick up. Thinking their absences won't make any difference to the larger world, they decide to "stay dead" and begin a new life together in Naples. They make no contact with their families or friends, including Lawrence's wife Catherine  and son David Jr ([[Robert Arthur .
