Oswald and a big bear are competing each other in a cock fight. While the bear's rooster is larger and stronger, Oswald's is more agile. After his cock gets knocked down by a hard impact, Oswald feeds it with some special seeds. The seeds benefitted the rabbit's chicken significantly until the bear's was taken down for good. Following his victory at the cock fighting event, Oswald is being paraded on a limousine. On the way, he spots a female raccoon whom he finds very attractive. Oswald jumps out of the car and comes to her. After a brief conversation, the rabbit and the raccoon became friends and started dancing around. Back at the cock fighting arena, the bear was depressed by his defeat and doesn't know what to do next. He tries to get his rooster back on its feet, only to see it fall again. The disgruntled bear then walks out and decides to take his frustration on Oswald. The film scene returns to Oswald who is still dancing around with the raccoon. Just then, the bear rushes in and confronts him. The bear tries to attack with a kick but Oswald cleverly catches the assailant's leg. The rabbit then takes off the bear's boot and gives a tickle on the foot, therefore incapacitating the bear who laughs uncontrollably. The bear attempts another assault, only to be tickled off by Oswald in the abdomen. In no time, Oswald's rooster comes in and tickles the bear out of the picture. Oswald then resumes his date with the raccoon.
