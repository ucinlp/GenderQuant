Mike Windgren works on a boat in Acapulco, Mexico. When the bratty daughter of the boat owner gets him fired, Mike must find new work. A Mexican boy named Raoul helps him get a job as a lifeguard and singer at a local hotel. Clashes abound when Mike runs into a rival lifeguard, who is the champion diver of Mexico. He is angry at Mike for taking some of his hours, and for stealing his woman. However, after Mike sees the lifeguard perform a number dangerous dives including flips and head-first dives into a section of the pool surrounded by a ring of fire, he decides to get even with him and eventually sets himself up to perform a death-defying dive off a 136-foot cliff in front of thousands of people. Mike dives of the cliff, and successfully lands in the water, earning the lifeguard's respect. As the crowd and the lifeguard applaud, Mike performs one more song and leaves with Margarita and Raoul.
