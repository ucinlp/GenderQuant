 Moe is on trial for assaulting Larry and Joe. Moe appeals to the judge , claiming he is a sick man who was instructed by his doctor to maintain peace and quiet. This peace is broken by Larry and Joe who are loudly rehearsing their "The Original Two-Man Quartet" routine to serenade Moe. Moe cracks, and wraps Larry's trombone slides around the quartet's neck. Realizing Moe is in bad shape, Larry and Joe decide to take their ailing leader on a hunting trip to relieve his stress. Moe takes to the idea like ducks to bread, and the Stooges start packing. No sooner do they arrive in an empty cabin when a hungry bear devours some eggs and potatoes while Moe has his back turned. His nerves double frayed, Moe asks Larry and Joe to pursue the bear. One thing leads to another, and the bear ends up behind the wheel of the Stooges' car, driving away with it. Then, when Moe thinks he is at the end of his rope, the Stooges get involved with a sheriff  in hot pursuit of outlaw Mad Bill Hookup . Back in the courtroom, Moe ends his story by concluding that he must go back to bed for six additional months. The judge takes pity on the poor Stooge, and finds him not guilty. Joe and Larry are disgusted by the ruling and are about to get theirs. But thanks to Larry's tough skull the axe is now broken and Moe begins to lose his nerves again.
