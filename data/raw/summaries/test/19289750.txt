In Iran there are different sections for men and women on public buses. Women should enter buses from the back door, which is separated from men’s entrance, and should sit or stay in a limited zone at the end of the buses which is separated from men’s zone. But Farahnaz Shiri, the first female bus driver in Tehran, has made her own little society in her bus. In this bus everything is vice-versa. Mrs. Shiri is the governor and the only law maker of her own little society. In her bus, men must enter from the backdoor entrance and must sit or stay in the limited zone at the end of the bus.
