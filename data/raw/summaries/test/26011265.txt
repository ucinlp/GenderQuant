Meenakshi , after her father's  death, joins Uma  at Krishnagudi, a small village in Andhra Pradesh. Pavithran , Uma's husband, is an Army officer posted there. The jovial and amiable atmosphere brings cheer and happiness back to Meenakshi. Giri , a colleague and family friend of Pavi, falls in love with Meenakshi, but she is not ready to accept his feelings. Akhilachandran , Meenakshi's spoiled cousin, was supported by her father after the death of his parents. Her father always wanted her to marry Akhil, but his extra-possessive attitude and violent behavior had created problems for her. Though she never had any soft feelings for him, Meenakshi had promised her father on his deathbed that she would marry Akhil. Pavi and Uma now want Meenakshi to get married to Giri, who is a soft-spoken and fun-loving guy. Akhil goes missing for a long time. Pavi suggests that Meenakshi should wait six months. If Akhil doesn't turn up in that time, then Meenakshi should accept Giri. She agrees. She mails Akhil about this, but no reply comes back. Giri and Meenakhi become close. Suddenly one evening Renji ([[Siddique  turns up at the quarter of Giri. Renji, a close friend of Akhil, informs Giri that Akhil had had an accident on his way back to Krishnagudi and is partially paralyzed. He was under Renji's care, but Renji has to leave for the U.S. So, Akhil should be handed over to Meenakshi. Giri breaks down after hearing the news that Akhil is returning. Giri and Jose , his roommate, take Akhil to a vacant quarter nearby and decide to take care of him, without letting Meenakshi or Pavi know. Akhil, a completely changed man, does not want to be a burden to Meenakshi and wants her to marry Giri as she had planned. When she learns this, Meenakshi thinks it is her moral responsibility to take care of the paralyzed Akhil; she decides to leave Krishnagudi for Kerala with Akhil. At the last moment, from the train, Akhil, using all his power, pushes her out, asking her to join Giri for the rest of her life.
