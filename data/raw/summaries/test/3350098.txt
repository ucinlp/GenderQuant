The husband of Laura Breckenridge has stolen $200,000 from a Denver mint. To return the money and clear her name, she offers Sam Whiskey a $20,000 reward to recover it. Sam brings along a blacksmith, Jedidiah Hooker, and an inventor, O.W. Bandy, on his quest, trailed by a villain called Fat Henry who wants the loot for himself. They create a false bust of George Washington made of gold that fools Fat Henry and are able to claim the $20,000, which Sam gratefully splits with his partners.
