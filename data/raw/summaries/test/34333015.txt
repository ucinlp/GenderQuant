Bruce Campbell plays an Indiana Jones-type explorer named Cleveland Smith, exploring a dark cave and avoiding oncoming boulders, evading chasing Indians and crossing the river in a canoe to escape them. When one of their spears springs a leak in his canoe, he jumps onto a rock that turns out to be a dinosaur, which he also escapes from, only to land in quicksand. When confronted by a nazi , Smith hooks his whip on a plane flying low, only to crash into a tree near a native camp, holding Smith's love interest Sally  hostage. Smith scares some of the natives off with a ventriloquist dummy, fights off a swordsman and a giant native and finally saves Sally while retrieving a pair of pants known as the "Waders of the Lost Park". Smith falls off a cliff and Sally is captured by the nazi from before, but springs a trap in the process.
