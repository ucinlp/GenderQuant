In rural Oklahoma, under the cover of night, a marina worker named Tor murders Denise, a local waitress, by slitting her throat, then dumps her body in Lake Tenkiller. The next day, a pair of co-eds, Leslie and Janna, head to Janna's summer home near Lake Tenkiller for summer break, and to get away from Leslie's abusive fianc√©, Josh. At the lake, the two get summer jobs at the diner Denise worked at, and meet Tor, who takes a liking to Leslie. Shortly after Leslie and Janna's arrival, Tor stabs another waitress, Debbie, to death in her home, and knifes and dismembers his lecherous boss, Preacher, outside of Janna's place, after catching him spying on the women. Eventually, Tor  murders Janna too, stopping by under the pretense of helping repair her damaged boat, and stabbing her in the back as she washes her hair. When Leslie returns home from work, and discovers what Tor has done, she runs off into the wilderness after slashing him across the face with a car key while he professes his love for her. While chasing Leslie, Tor hears Josh's car pull up, and murders him by slashing his throat, leaving his corpse propped up in a room for Leslie to find when she returns to the house. Knocking Leslie out when she finds Josh's body, Tor places her in his boat and starts rowing across the lake, but is knocked overboard and seemingly drowns when Leslie awakens and swims to shore. As a narration by Leslie comments that the police were never able to discern who her attacker really was or where he came from, Tor is shown leaping out of the water.
