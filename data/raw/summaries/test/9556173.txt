Norman , a lowly stock clerk at Burridge's department store, is in love with another employee, Sally Wilson , though he has been unable to muster the courage to let her know how he feels. After he antagonizes the new head of the store, Augustus Freeman , he is promptly fired. On his way out, Norman helps Miss Bacon  carry her bulging suitcases, unaware that she is an audacious shoplifter. Freeman sees Norman assisting a "customer" and rehires him. Meanwhile, Peggy Drew , the store's personnel manager, flirts with Mr. Freeman, while plotting with her boyfriend Gerald  to rob the place. Norman is fired and rehired again and again, as his escapades somehow manage to benefit the store. He also finally becomes acquainted with Sally, chasing her down through the city streets to return her purse. His antics make her laugh. After his latest firing, Norman is alarmed to find the handsome, suave Gerald trying to get to know Sally better. When he goes to the man's apartment to warn him to stay away from her, Norman inadvertently uncovers the robbery plot, scheduled to coincide with a big sale the next day. But, he is unable to get Sally or anyone else to take him seriously. Sally eventually decides to bring Norman's story to the attention of the management, but tells the wrong person, Miss Drew, and is tied up for her efforts. Norman finds her and together, they foil the thieves. Freeman takes Norman back into his employ...but not for long.
