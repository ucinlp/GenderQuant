One year after the explosion of Flight 180, college student Kimberly Corman heads to Daytona Beach with her friends for their spring break. While driving, Kimberly has a premonition of a pile-up along Route 23, killing everyone involved. Aghast, she stalls her car and prevents lottery winner Evan Lewis, widow Nora Carpenter and her son Tim, businesswoman Kat Jennings, stoner Rory Peters, pregnant Isabella Hudson, teacher Eugene Dix, and cop Thomas Burke from entering the highway. While Thomas questions Kimberly, the pile-up occurs and kills her friends Shaina, Dano, and Frankie. The survivors are questioned at the police station and informed with the events of the previous film. They are negligent of Death until Evan dies from a fire escape ladder impalement. Desperate for help, Kimberly visits Clear Rivers, the last survivor of Flight 180, inside her psychiatric ward. Though Clear initially refuses to help and invites Kimberly to share her isolation, Clear accompanies Kimberly and Thomas to mortician William Bludworth after Tim is crushed by a glass pane. Bludworth explains the equilibrium of Death and "new life", implying their salvation upon the birth of Isabella's son. Isabella is taken into custody while the other survivors unite for safety. Overcome by grief, Nora is decapitated by malfunctioning elevator doors. Horrified, Eugene attempts suicide but fails, prompting the group to leave and find Isabella. En route, they discover that their existence lay on the fates of Flight 180's survivors. As Isabella goes into labor, her van nearly collides with the survivors, crashing them onto a farm. In the process, Eugene's abdomen is punctured by PVC pipes which Kat narrowly avoids. Rory pulls Brian Gibbons from the path of a news van as rescuers arrive at the scene. Their Jaws of Life activates Kat's airbag, spearing her head within the pipe and dropping her cigarette on a gasoline leak, blasting the news van and trisecting Rory with a barbed wire fence. As Kimberly, Clear, and Thomas dash to the hospital, Kimberly has another forewarning of Dr. Ellen Kalarjian "strangling" Isabella. The trio successfully halt Kalarjian and salvage Isabella; however, Kimberly has another vision of a submerging van and Isabella's embargo from Death all along, denoting that their trial is still at large. Clear searches for Eugene, accidentally detonating his room from oxygen combustion, killing her and Eugene. Kimberly tackles Thomas from the explosion's debris and realizes her premonitions convey her fate. Although Kimberly immerses a van into a lake for Thomas' sake, she is recovered by Thomas and resuscitated by Kalarjian. Afterwards, Thomas and Kimberly have a picnic with Brian's family and Kimberly's father Michael Corman to celebrate their survival. Learning of Brian's deterrence from Death before, the group witnesses a barbecue grill blast Brian, catapulting his burnt arm onto his mother's plate as she screams in horror.
