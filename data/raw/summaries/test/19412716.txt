Simon Sparrow, now a senior doctor at St Swithins, falls in love with Delia, a model and aspiring actress. They eventually move in together, but then she goes to Italy to try out for a film. Meanwhile, Spratt injures his back in a fall. Placed under the care of physiotherapist Iris Marchant, he is initially hostile, but soon succumbs to her charms. He turns to his friend Simon for advice. Simon sends him to a nature cure clinic in a vain attempt to help him lose weight. Spratt has Iris followed, and, when his private investigator turns up at St Swithins as a patient, follows her himself . He proposes to her, but is eventually rejected in favour of another of her patients, retired army Major Tommy French. Delia returns in England, having somehow acquired an expensive Italian car  and expensive clothes, though she did not land a part in the film. It is implied that she and Simon get together again.
