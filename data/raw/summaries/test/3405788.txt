 Shyamal  is an ambitious sales manager in a British fan manufacturing firm in Calcutta, where he is expecting a promotion shortly. He is married to Dolan and lives in a company flat. He aspires to become the company director. His sister-in-law, Tutul , arrives from Patna to stay with them for a few days. She is given a tour of the life they lead and the many upscale spaces they inhabit &mdash; the restaurants, the beauty parlours, clubs and race courses. Tutul, whose father Shyamal had once been a student under, greatly admires him and his idealism. Secretly she is envious of her sister's marriage with him. Life goes on smoothly for Shyamal until he learns that a consignment of fans meant for export is defective just before the shipment of a prestigious order. To escape blame Shyamal hatches a plan with the labour officer to provoke a strike at the factory. A factory watchman is badly injured, a false riot is organised and a lock-out declared. For his 'efficient' handling of the crisis, Shyamal is promoted, and there is congratulations all around. However Shyamalendu has fallen in the eyes of Tutul and himself. He is finally at the top, successful &mdash; and desolate.
