Mamarazzi is the story of a mother who constantly pries into the lives of her three children, often resulting in riotous and hilarious situations. Fifteen years ago, Violy Langit , an owner of a small funeral parlor, learns that she is suffering from a medical condition that requires her to undergo a hysterectomy. All her life, she’s wanted to have children; she realizes that she has to do it before the procedure. But Violy has no man in her life &mdash; no husband, no boyfriend, no suitors. She seeks the help of her best friend, Mandy . Out of pity and love for Violy, Mandy offers his boyfriend Carlo  to serve as a sperm donor. With Mandy’s blessing, Violy and Carlo share a night filled with romance, passion, and mystery &mdash; for after that night, Carlo disappears completely from the lives of Violy and Mandy. Violy gets her wish. She is blessed with a set of triplets &mdash; two girls, Peachy and Strawberry , and one boy, Dingdong  &mdash; which she raises as a single mother. As the children gets older, Violy, with all her might, does all ways and means to have happy kids even to the extent of helping her son get the girl that he wants: Mimi . Being an extremely controlling and overly nosy mother makes her kids wonder about their mom’s intentions. Little do her children know that all she’s doing is to make her family happy. Adding to the children’s frustration is getting her mom to reveal the real identity of their father. As tensions run high and emotions soar, their story explodes in a flurry of shocking, funny, and quirky revelations that forever change everyone’s life.
