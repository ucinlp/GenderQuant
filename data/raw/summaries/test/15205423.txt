From her appearance to her mannerisms, it is easy to tell that Jung Han-kyeong  is a country girl. After her father's death, she comes to Seoul to live with her mother , planning to attend Kang-Shin High School. However, her life in Seoul is a series of mental and physical shocks. On the bus, a slipper is thrown randomly at her headâ€”but her problems don't end there. The guy who threw the slipper is none other than Ban Hae-won , the most popular guy at her school, and everywhere he steps, girls trail behind. Seeing Han-kyeong's pitiable and adorable nature, Hae-Won falls for her. The leader of Sung-Kwon High, Kang-Shin's neighbor and rival, is named Jung Tae-sung , and he, too, has feelings for Han-kyeong. Despite his shy, adorable face, Tae-sung has strong fists and endless obstinacy. A fight that handles both pride and love begins between the two, and neither of them is prepared to back down. But Tae-sung has a secret, one that forces him to love Han-kyeong in spite of himself, and Han-kyeong, ignorant of this, tries to do her best to be gentle with both of them. Eventually, Tae-sung leaves Han-kyeong's side, and later, Han-kyeong and Hae-won learn of his secret.
