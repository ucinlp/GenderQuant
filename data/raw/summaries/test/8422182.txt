Acrobacias del corazón was the first film where Marisa Teresa Costantini took the central role of a consecrated director and actress. Ironically the film centres around the life of a film director, Marisa , her current husband Jorge  and the director's best friend Lucia  a successful trapeze artist in the circus who are involved in a love triangle. In the film the fictional director Marisa is currently planning to produce a new romantic film for which her present husband Jorge wrote the script, thinking lustfully about Lola ]] --> In real life, a time ago in her personal life director and actress María Teresa Constantini suffered a marriage separation and a long legal process which resulted in her acquiring a substantial sum of money which she used to establish Buenos Aires Productions. This real life situation is reflected through the film director she actually portrays in the film, although the film is far more exaggerated in a world of romances, passions, treasons and deceits, in which the men are idiotic, cowardly and weak. From the beginning to the end of the film there is always evidence of an extravagant lifestyle with luxurious cars and glamorous women and suave men. The film reflects the paradise of an upper middle class that seems to live on another planet than the poor, as shown by the trapeze artist's different life experiences to the director that Costantini portrays in the film. Along with the prevalent themes of love, passion, deceit and adultery the film also identifies these differences in class.
