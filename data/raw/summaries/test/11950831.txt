Eastwood appears as a Southern cowboy Keith Williams who is upset over having to join up with a group of Yankees who have been attacked by the same group of Indians. Most film guides include in their entry for this film a quote attributed to Eastwood, "probably the lousiest Western ever made."For example, The Overlook Film Encyclopedia: The Western, ed. by Phil Hardy, page 261 attributes the quotation to Eastwood, omitting the "probably."
