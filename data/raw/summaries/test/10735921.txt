Man Bahadur is an ex-Gurkha soldier living in Hong Kong with his family. He has a son named Himal , a nephew Suraj —whom he has looked after since childhood—and his wife . Himal and Suraj are the same age, and are close. However, there is a great difference in their personalitites. Himal’s thinking is westernized; he likes hip-hop music and has friends of poor character. Himal uses drugs occasionally, and is dating a girl named Jenny from the Philippines. He spends most of his time in discos, rather than with his family or at work. On the other hand, Suraj has a good work ethic and  likes Nepalese music, food and culture. Man Bahadur and his wife are concerned about Himal’s behaviour; while he fears their son has escaped their influence, she has not lost hope yet. She thinks if Himal marries a Nepalese girl, everything will be alright. One day in a disco, Himal gets drunk and  kisses a girl against her will. A fight breaks out between Himal and the girl’s boyfriend, and Himal is badly beaten up. Man Bahadur's worst fears are concerned; his wife is still optimistic, though, and insists on finding a Nepalese girl for him. Man Bahadur resists at first, but eventually agrees to write his childhood friend Bal Bahadur for his daughter Kiran’s  hand in marriage for Himal. Man proposes that Bal send his daughter to Hong Kong as a tourist; during her stay in Hong Kong if Himal and Kiran like each other, only then will their parents announce the marriage. Bal is delighted, thinking Himal is the perfect groom for his daughter and hoping she can escape the hardship in Nepal. After consulting his wife Bal sends Kiran to Hong Kong, telling Kiran that it is their gift for her college vacation. Kiran arrives in Hong Kong, and meets Himal and Suraj; during her stay with the family she gets to know them, and finds herself gradually falling in love with Suraj. Himal, on the other hand, is happy with his girlfriend Jenny, drinking and using drugs. Due to absenteeism he is fired from his job, refuses to get another and runs through his savings; this drives Jenny to leave him. Himal incurs a serious head injury in a fight with Jenny's new boyfriend and his friends; in the hospital after surgery, he realizes the error of his ways and vows to turn over a new leaf. Out of gratitude to Man Bahadur and his family, Kiran visits Himal in the hospital; he finds her attractive, not knowing she is already in love with Suraj. Man Bahadur and his wife see that Himal and Kiran like each other; thinking Kiran is responsible for Himal's rehabilitation they announce their engagement at a party, stunning Suraj and Kiran. Kiran leaves the party; Suraj follows her, and after a long talk convinces Kiran to marry Himal to keep the family together. At the airport for the flight to Nepal for the wedding Himal learns everything about Suraj and Kiran, and is ashamed to be the villain in Suraj and Kiran’s romance. He thanks Kiran, wishes all the best to her and Suraj and leaves them together.
