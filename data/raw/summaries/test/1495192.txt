Two brothers, mortician Nikolai and actor Osip , love the same womanâ€”scientist Anna, who studies the Earth's core, or the "heart of the world." Anna discovers that the world is in danger. In order to save it, she must choose between the brothers, and finally decides on a rich industrialist, Akmatov. As a result, the very heart of the world has a heart attack. Realizing what she has done, she strangles Akmatov and enters the Earth's core, replacing the failed heart with her own. The world is then saved by the new message, Kino.
