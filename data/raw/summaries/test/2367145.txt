Thomas Crown, a millionaire businessman and sportsman, pulls off a perfect crime by having five men rob a Boston bank and dump the money—approximately $2.6 million—in a cemetery trash can. Crown never meets any of the five face-to-face, before or after the crime. He retrieves the money later and deposits it at a bank in Geneva. Vicki Anderson, an independent insurance investigator, is contracted to investigate the heist. She will receive a percentage of the stolen money if she recovers it. When Crown comes to her attention as a possible suspect, she checks him out and instantly is convinced he is the mastermind behind the robbery. Crown does not need the money but is in need of diversions. He plays polo and golf, flies a glider and drives a dune buggy, but is generally bored. Vicki makes it clear to him that she knows he is the thief and intends to prove it. They begin a game of cat and mouse, the attraction between them evident, and their relationship soon evolves into an affair. But it is complicated by Vicki's vow to find the money and help Detective Eddie Malone bring the guilty party to justice. A reward offer entices the wife of the bank robbery's getaway driver, Erwin, to "fink" on him. Vicki finds out that he was hired by a man he never saw. She tries putting Erwin in the same room as Crown, but there is no hint of recognition on either one's part. Vicki is clearly closing in, though. Crown decides to organize another robbery exactly like the first one, and tells Vicki where the "drop" will be, because he has to know for sure that she is on his side. The robbery is successful but there are gunshots and the viewer is left with the impression that people may have died, raising the stakes for Vicki's decision. Vicki moves in with the cops at the cemetery - they watch one of the robbers make the drop, and wait for Crown to show up so they can arrest him, but when his Rolls Royce arrives, she sees that Crown has sent a messenger in his place with a telegram asking her to bring the money and join him or if not, then she should keep the Rolls Royce. She tears the telegram to bits and throws the pieces to the wind, looking up at the sky with tears in her eyes. Crown is then shown flying away in a jet, a smile on his face.
