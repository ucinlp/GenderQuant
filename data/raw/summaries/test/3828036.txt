{{Plot}} The film opens with Sergeant Dudfoot talking about his life as a policeman at Turnbotham Round during a radio broadcast. His staff Albert and Harbottle  enter with Harbottle after they have been poaching and Harbottle ruins the broadcast. The next morning, Dudfoot decides to find some crime and finally comes up with the idea of setting up a speed trap. Their plans fail and what is more, in trying to execute it Dudfoot hits a motorist on the back of the head, knocking him out and then driving him to the police station. But they discover he is their Chief Constable. Albert decides to wreck the chief's car, making it look like he had a crash. Dudfoot then suggests driving it into something to make it look more believable, and he crashes it through the window of Harbottle's shop. Later when the trio tell the chief he had a nasty road accident, it backfires since the chief remembers the incident, but the Squire of Turnbotham Round then claims that he witnessed the accident, saving Dudfoot, Harbottle and Albert from a lot of trouble. The Chief leaves after Harbottle makes up a story about a Headless Horseman when questioned about his old looks. Dudfoot states that they need to arrest a criminal soon or else their police station will be closed down and Harbottle takes him to the library to look for books on crime. On their way the coastguard stops them and tells them his brother a lighthouse keeper wants a light hung up on top of the police station as his grandmother is very ill and he agreed to the idea that if he could see the light on the Police Station tower he'd know his grandmother was still alive. Unknown to the cops, this is connected to the smugglers. Later Albert suggests that they should capture some smugglers by placing a keg of brandy on the beach and getting a witness to see what happens. Dudfoot comes back into the station with a fisherman, who is carrying a keg of brandy and Albert and Harbottle say they haven't taken their keg down to the beach yet, therefore resulting in two kegs of liquor. Albert’s girlfriend Emily screams and passes out as she claims to have seen a Headless Horseman. Later Albert spots the Headless Horseman too and after a brief encounter with him in the Squire’s garage, they are scared away by the Horseman but Harbottle manages to tuck away a small package that he found. Back at the police station, the Chief Constable phones them and informs them about the smuggling taking place and tell them to find the navigational light that the smugglers are using. In spite of the light episode with him, the three policemen brush off the idea that the coastguard is involved with the smuggling. A warning note to keep their noses out of things is wrapped around the stone is thrown in through the police station window. A ticking sound is heard from the package that Harbottle earlier picked up and they find pocket watches inside. Harbottle then recites a rhyme which tells the legend of the Headless Horseman, although he doesn't know the last line, but his father does. So the trio decide to pay him a visit. Harbottle's father reveals the line thus also revealing the place, the Devil's Cave where the smuggling is taking place. The trio investigate the cave, follow a tunnel and discover many barrels of liquor and many other things that seemed to belong to Harbottle. They figure that they are in their own cellar. While they decide to call the Chief Constable, they are confronted by the Squire who reveals he is the leader of the smugglers. After a fight in the dark, the smugglers lock the trio in their own cell and escape deciding to give chase in their car, but since the other police agents think they are smugglers as well, their car is also wanted. After a chase, the police agents finally capture the smugglers. The Chief Constable asks the Squire if he has seen him before, but the Squire denies this. Dudfoot then reveals the story of the accident at Harbottle's shop, and the Chief Constable orders that the trio be arrested. Dudfoot punches the Chief Constable and the trio run as fast as they can along the race track away from the other pursuing policemen.
