A woman goes into a train station and runs into a man standing in the middle of the floor. He attempts to help her pick up her belongings, and she protests. This interaction makes her miss her train, and when she leaves the station she can not find her wallet. She makes her way to a cafeteria and takes a salad, and pays for it while informing the waiter that she may not have enough money. After she sits down, she realizes that she has no cutlery, and returns to the service counter for a fork. When she comes back, she finds a man who appears to be African American sitting down and eating a salad. She sits down and informs the man that that is her salad, but receives no response. She then attempts to take the salad away from him, at which he slams his fist on the table. Finally, she uses her fork to take pieces of salad off of her plate. The man mimics the way she eats, then gets up and returns with two cups , and offers her sugar, which she declines. He then reaches into his pocket and pulls out a packet, which she accepts, opens, and puts in her drink. She brings the cup up to her mouth, but then puts it down and leaves the restaurant. Once outside, she realizes that she does not have her bags. She returns to the cafeteria, and her bags are not in the booth she was sitting in. Anxious, she paces back and forth, not noticing that there are bags in the next cubicle. When she does notice, she sees a salad sitting there, along with her bags. Realizing that the man never actually stole her salad and instead was eating his own, she laughs, takes her bags, and leaves the restaurant. In the next scene, she is in the train station, where she passes a man asking for money for food. She enters a train, and rests her head against the bullwark with a slight smile on her face. The doors closes, and the train pulls out of the station.
