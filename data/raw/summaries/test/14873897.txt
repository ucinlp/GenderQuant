Nim  is an 11-year-old girl, whose mother, Emily, has died. Her father, Jack Rusoe , a marine biologist, said she was swallowed by a blue whale after it was scared by a ship called the Buccaneers. Nim lives on an island in the South Pacific and has some local animals for company: Selkie the sea lion, Fred the lizard, and Galileo the pelican. Jack goes by boat on a scientific mission of two days to find protozoa nim ; he wants to take his daughter along, but she convinces him that she needs to stay to oversee the imminent hatching of Chicca's eggs and can manage on her own; they will be able to communicate by satellite phone. Nim, who is fond of Alex Rover adventure books written by Alexandra Rover , receives an email addressed to her father with an inquiry about his field of knowledge. The sender "Alex Rover" seems to be the explorer, but is actually Alexandra, a neurotic San Franciscan who constantly sees her character Alex Rover . An email conversation follows, where Nim first acts as her father's assistant and goes to the island with the volcano. Jack suffers a shipwreck, which makes it impossible for Nim and Jack to communicate. Therefore he does not return as planned. Galileo brings Jack things he needs to fix his ship. Nim explains the situation to "Alex". Although Alexandra suffers from agoraphobia and therefore never leaves the house or even opens the door, she travels to the island to rescue Nim. The island is visited by tourists. Nim believes them to be pirates. Without revealing herself she gets out of the crater just in time as plumes of clouds burst out. Down at the beach the tourists scramble to the boats One of them, a young, rich boy, Edmund, sees and follows her. He is confused by her presence but believes her to be another tourist. When he tells the others they do not believe him.
