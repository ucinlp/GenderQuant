Hichem has dreamt with "harga" since he was a child. One day he set forth on the sea towards Europe, on the grand forbidden voyage in a precarious open boat with 27 other Tunisians, some of whom were his friends. Hichem is the only one who has come back. Other Tunisians tell us why they want to leave their country: poverty, unemployment, no hope for the future, trapped in a dead end. They are ready to do anything to improve their situation, and that includes risking their lives.
