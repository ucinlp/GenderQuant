{{Tone}} Diabolik starts off by stealing $10 million which was under escort. Under a smoke screen, Diabolik winches the money car away and escapes in a speed boat, then in his car, closely followed by a helicopter shooting at him . Diabolik changes cars in a tunnel and his black one goes off the edge of a cliff. He drives off with Eva when the helicopter leaves. In their high-tech underground hideout , they shower . The couple do some smooching on a revolving bed covered in stolen money. The Minister of the Interior holds a sombre press conference which is disrupted by wild laughter by all thanks to some exhilarating gas Diabolik has released there. In desperation, the death penalty  is brought back in. The police cannot find Diabolik but big time crook, Valmont suffers at their hands because of a clampdown due to Diabolik's actions. A club is raided by the police. Valmont on his bimbo-laden yacht has had enough and berates his men who have failed him. Realising things can only get worse because of Diabolik stirring the police up, Valmont contacts Ginko and makes a bargain, to catch Diabolik alive for the police. On his plane, Valmont tells his men of his plan and all who disagree with him are killed. Back at his hideout, Diabolik decides to steal the famous Aksand emerald necklace for Eva's birthday from the Saint Just Castle. Meanwhile Valmont builds up an identikit picture of Eva and circulates it as a means of capturing Diabolik. Diabolik changes his normal black skin tight costume for a white skin tight costume so he can climb the white tower wall unnoticed . The police are waiting, knowing he will go after the necklace. He gets it despite police surveillance of the room and they go after him, shooting at a figure catapulted off of the roof, believing it to be him escaping. It is a dummy. A police car chasing him goes off a cliff and explodes, trying to avoid an oncoming car in a mirror Diabolik has set up. Later, Eva is spotted in a garage with her white car. It is dry weather but when a man looks at her in his rear view mirror, it is raining and has been for some time. Valmont is informed and Eva is traced to a clinic and captured. She is used to lure Diabolik aboard Valmont's plane, along with the ten million dollars he has stolen and the eleven emeralds from the necklace as payment for Eva. Diabolik is made to jump where the police are waiting below for him, but takes Valmont with him. The plane behind them blows up  and he rescues Eva as the police close in. He makes her escape, kills Valmont and trapped, takes a golden capsule, and the police find him dead. Later while the police are holding a conference on the death of Diabolik, he is about to be autopsied when he returns to life. It is thanks to a technique he has learned from Tibetan lamas but if he does not get the antidote within 12 hours, he becomes dead for real. The nurse, Eva, wheels Diabolik past the crowds and then Diabolik goes to the morgue in disguise, where Valmont's body has been cremated and collects the 11 emeralds he fired into his body, from his ashes. He escapes just ahead of Ginko who has just realised what the 11 bullet wounds in Valmont meant. A million dollar reward is offered for Diabolik who goes to war against the government by blowing up all the tax offices and destroying all their records. The country  is in deep trouble without tax revenue so decides to sell off some gold to buy hard currency. The 20 tons of gold is melted into one solid block to make it "impossible" to steal, put into a steel casket and loaded on a train. Diabolik and Eva reroute the train by dropping a  truck on the tracks so it has to take a bridge over a wide river. There is an explosion and the train and gold falls into the water where Diabolik and Eva inflate balloons underwater and tow it away to their hideout. However, they did not know that part of the steel casket has been irradiated allowing the police to trace it and they close in on Diabolik who is wearing a heat proof suit as he is melting the gold, to put it into ingots. Shot at by many police guns, Diabolik is unable to control the heating of the gold and it runs out of control. There is an explosion and Diabolik and the cavern are covered in molten gold. Again, Diabolik is believed to be dead, with his heat proof suit now covered in hardened gold. The police seal off the place to recover it later and Eva is allowed to pay her respects to the dead Diabolik, who when Ginko is not looking winks at her. Eva leaves with Ginko and the cavern lights are turned off, then is the laughter of Diabolik is heard, with him apparently having a way to escape to strike again.
