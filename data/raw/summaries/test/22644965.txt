Bob de Rooy is an arrogant, egotistical man who divorces his well-meaning, but very naive wife Annie, because she's unable to provide him the right amount of sex in their married life. After the divorce is settled, Bob goes to the red light district in Amsterdam to catch up what he has been missing all those years. There he starts an affair with a prostitute who turns out to be the wife of gangster boss Don Gorgonzola. When the criminal boss finds out that his daughter has an affair with Bob, who arrogantly makes fun of him on the phone and hangs up before he does, Bob and his new found love have to flee to Curaçao. Meanwhile Annie falls in love three times, first with a notorious criminal who is later shot by one of Gorgonzola's henchmen, then with a man who dies of cancer and later one of Gorgonzola's henchmen who exploits Annie's innocence to let her smuggle drugs to Curaçao. There Annie and Bob meet again...
