During the middle years of the war, three men are called up to serve in the British Army. The Englishman Philip Hamilton, the American David Morgan and the Irishman Smoke O'Connor are drafted into the Guards Division and report to their barracks at Caterham, Surrey. After going through strict training  they find themselves receiving emergency promotions. Philip and David are promoted to 2nd Lieutenant and Smoke to Corporal and now attached to a tank company of the Welsh Guards, where Philip and David command their own tank and Smoke is part of David's crew. Months of 'real' training follow, where they learn about tank warfare and also their comrades. The film follows the three main characters as the Guards Armoured Division lands at Normandy weeks after D-Day, and on into combat as part of the break-out. We see how they cope with different aspects of fighting a war on another continent, such as being separated from family and loved ones and coping with the loss of comrades. The film follows the events of Operation Market Garden and The Battle of the Bulge but with the Welsh Guards as the pivotal British Army unit. During Market Garden we see the Welsh Guards link up with American paratroopers at the Grave bridge before moving on to Nijmegen and the failure of the operation. The film ends with the Ardennes Offensive and the Guards' unknown operations around the east side of the river Meuse, and only Smoke is left alive from the three friends.
