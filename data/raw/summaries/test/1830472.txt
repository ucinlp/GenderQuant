School is out for the summer, and a group of young teenagers go on a hike with Vic, an experienced guide. One teen, Alan, butts head with Vic during the film as Vic's attempts to teach life lessons annoy Alan. The more defiant Alan gets, the more extreme the lessons come from Vic. Alan's defiance and Vic's aggressive lessons culminate in disaster and Vic winds up breaking his leg. Alan then has to use his skills and some of Vic's to get down from the mountain.
