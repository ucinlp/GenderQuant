As a front-line police officer, you never leave a brother behind... Tactical Unit Column Sergeant Sam  and May  have been working together for some time but have never got along well. May is promoted recently as she always wins praises from her supervisor, whereas Sam is shut out from any chance of promotion. As a result their column's morale drops to all-time low. A daring bank heist takes the tactical unit to Hong Kong's remote mountains searching for armed bandits. As Sam and May lead their team to conduct sweeps amidst treacherous terrain and deadly ambushes, they understand the only way to survive the mission is if they stick together as one.
