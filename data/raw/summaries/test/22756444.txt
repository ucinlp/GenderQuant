Abby  is creative head of a private Ad Agency in Mumbai, which is on the growth curve when the owner of the ad agency decides to sell it to an American multinational with Maxi  as the VP in charge of the merged entity. Abby and George, who is the account executive in the agency, do not want the merger as they feel they don't need another agency for their growth. When Maxi comes on board, she doesn't like Abby's lack of punctuality and now wants him to work with her as per her directives. This sets the ball rolling with multiple tiffs laced with situational comedy, between the new VP and Abby. Maxi decides to shoot campaign for a new and important customer in Pokhara where the tiff between her and Abby continues. As they are directing the shoot standing on a dingy on a fast moving river, the dingy cuts loose and both Abby and Maxi are swept away by the strong currents and somehow manage to swim ashore together and it is here they realize that they do like each other. An event takes place that suddenly morphs the movie from a lighthearted comedy into a thriller. One evening Tanya, an attractive women, and a native of Pokhara, who was a fellow traveler on the flight from Mumbai lands up with Abby that angers Maxi and she refuses to speak normally to Abby the next day. Abby, also a bit hurt and angry, lands up spending the night with Tanya after a drinking bout only to wake up next day that she is lying murdered next to him. He runs away from the scene, quite certain that he will be blamed for killing her. As the local police start to chase the leads, Abby confides in Bunty, the local Guide, and Maxi, and both disbelieve him. He also starts to get calls from a stranger demanding something. With police in hot chase, it is now up to him to find out who really killed Tanya, what was the motive for her death, and who wanted him at the scene of the crime. The surprise pack of the movie is Sonu Nigam who other than playback singing for himself, has displayed very natural acting and good comic timing. Rajpal Yadav as usual is very good and so is the newcomer Sweta Keswani in the role of Sandy. Flora Saini is adequate. Soundtrack of the movie has been composed by Nikhil-Vinay, with few catchy numbers.
