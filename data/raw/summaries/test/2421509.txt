Marion Post  is a New York philosophy professor past the age of 50, married to Ken , a doctor, and on a leave of absence to write a new book. Due to construction work in their building, she sublets a furnished flat downtown to have peace and quiet. Her work there is interrupted by voices from a neighboring office in the building where a therapist conducts his analysis. She quickly realizes that she is privy to the despairing sessions of another woman  who is disturbed by a growing feeling that her life is false and empty. Her words strike a chord in Marion, who begins to question herself in the same way. She learns from her sister-in-law that her brother may idolize her, but he also hates her. She comes to realise that, like her father , she has been unfair, unkind and judgmental to many of the people closest to her: her brother Paul  and his fragile wife Lynn , her best friend from high school Claire , her first husband Sam , and her stepdaughter Laura . She also realises that her current marriage to Ken is unfulfilling and that she missed her one chance at love with his best friend Larry . She finally manages to meet the woman in therapy as she contemplates a Klimt painting called 'Hope' and, although she wants to know more about her, she ends up talking more about herself, realizing that she made a mistake by having an abortion years ago and that at her age there are many things in life she will not have anymore. By the end of the film, Marion resolves to change her life for the better.
