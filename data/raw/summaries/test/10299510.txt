Hajji Hossein-Gholi Noori, an influential Qajar politician is sent by Nasereddin Shah to the United States of America during the time of President Andrew Johnson to serve as Iran's ambassador. Once in America Hajji hires a number of employees but soon finds himself missing his family and finding his work unrewarding considering there are very few Iranians in America at the time. Hajji Hossein-Gholi Noori is sent to the United States, then under the presidency of Grover Cleveland, to open up the first embassy for Iran by Nasir al-Din Shah Qajar. He is sent there with one helper on this mission and soon hires three workers to maintain the embassy. It doesn't take long for him to realize that there is no real work for him there and he is forced to quit his staff and allow his helper to attend medical school in Washington D.C. Although most of the first meeting of Hajji and the President is comical, the overall tone of the film is rather elegic in nature.
