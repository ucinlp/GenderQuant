In 1950s South Africa, a land torn apart by apartheid, Amina epitomizes individuality and freedom. She runs the Location Café, a haven of fun, food and festivities open to all. Amina defines her own laws and lives on her own terms undeterred by the reproving police and the disparaging Indian community. Miriam demurely follows conventions and makes no demands on life. Her world is confined to being a doting mother to her three children and a subservient wife to her chauvinistic husband Omar. Amina has a covert business partner Jacob. By virtue of being ‘coloured’ he is not allowed to own a business. Jacob fancies a local white postmistress Madeleine but their desire to pursue a relationship is thwarted by the indignities and injustices of the prevalent laws. Omar’s sister Rehmat marries a white man against rules that forbid mixed marriages. When she needs protection from police Amina shelters her. Amina’s charm and strength of character captivate Miriam. When Amina accepts a farming job in her backyard Miriam secretly rejoices at the opportunity to connect with her. Amina notices Miriam’s inherent kindness and silent dedication and the mutual attraction between them grows. They bare their hearts to each other and their emotions get entangled. They contrive another reason to meet – driving lessons. The inescapable social distance between them makes them question their feelings but in the midst of hatred and oppression their only refuge is love. In the resplendent South African landscape with retro music strewn in the background, The World Unseen explores Miriam’s relationship with Amina and how it empowers her to make personal choices that change her world.
