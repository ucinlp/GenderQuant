The film begins with the birth of Karishma  and Karan  on the same day in the same hospital. 23 years later, unknown of their family backgrounds, they meet each other one summer at Krakow University Poland and fall in love. When Karan finds out her family background, he starts avoiding Karishma. What happens thereafter is a succession of interesting events that you would get to see in this musical extravaganza from the house of Shakti Samanta which made some memorable romantic films like Aradhana, Kati Patang, Amar Prem, Kashmir Ki Kali and others. http://www.gomolo.com/yeh-jo-muhobat-hai-movie/42248/
