A celebrity roast for Fred Flintstone on his 48th birthday featuring Yogi Bear, Jabberjaw, Huckleberry Hound, Scooby-Doo, The Banana Splits, Hong Kong Phooey, Quick Draw McGraw, Snagglepuss and The Hair Bear Bunch. The show is hosted by Roy Clark and Bonnie Franklin with special guest stars The Sylvers and featuring Course & Young, the Fentons, Sashi Kuchiki, the Ice Capettes and a special appearance by The Skatebirds. When Roy and Bonnie announce the guest of honor, Fred is at home watching the event on TV. As Fred and Barney rush off to the ice arena, the show continues with musical numbers, mediocre ice displays including a comedy team, precision skating, disco-on-ice, jazz skating and an acrobatic number with fiery torches. When Fred finally arrives, the guests perform a "Happy Birthday" salute.
