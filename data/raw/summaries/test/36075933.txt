Brian is a 16 year-old who can't play basketball, but he still wants to play like his hero, Kevin Durant. At an Oklahoma City Thunder game, Brian gets chosen to shoot a half court shot, misses badly, and hits the mascot in the process. Later on, he gets a chance to meet Durant and expresses his desire to play just like him. When Kevin gives Brian the ball, they  switch talents. Brian becomes a high school phenomenon and Durant is stuck in a supposed "slump". Brian's success comes to the attention of Durant's agent, who figures out what happened to his client. With the Thunder on the verge of missing the playoffs, Brian and the agent try to give Kevin his talent back.
