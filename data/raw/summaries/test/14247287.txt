The trio run a dog grooming business who use a conveyor belt contrivance Ã  la an Our Gang invention . On their way home, the Stooges pick up what they believe to be an abandoned baby on a front doorstep. When the trio realize that the mother  had simply locked herself out and was simply in the back of house looking for an extra house key, they become frantic. In an effort to quietly work their way to the police station with the infant, Moe and Larry disguise Curly as the baby's mother, crowning him "Mrs. O'Toole." Unfortunately, kindly Policeman O'Halloran  strikes up a conversation with the Irish mother, leading the boys to eventually get cold feet and run. After they are caught, the father of the child  recognizes the Stooges as the local dog groomers and all is forgiven.
