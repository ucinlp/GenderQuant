In the spring of 1865 in Nevada, a small band of Confederate soldiers disguised as civilians intercept a shipment of gold escorted by Union cavalry troops. Following a heated battle that results in losses on both sides, Confederate Major Matt Stewart  learns from a dying Union officer that the war ended a month earlier. Matt and his men transport the gold as planned to the scheduled rendezvous with Captain Petersen  who has been scouting the area disguised as a traveling peddler. When Petersen confirms that the war is indeed over and admits that he knew of Lee's surrender but made no attempt to tell the men, hot-headed Rolph Bainter  shoots him dead. The men briefly debate what to do with the gold. As ranking officer, Matt decides they will take the gold back to the South to help finance their country's reconstruction. The following day, Matt disguises himself as a peddler and uses Petersen's covered wagon to transport the gold out of the areaâ€”his men hidden inside. Soon they are stopped by a posse looking for the gold thieves, but before they discover the Confederate rebels hidden inside the wagon, Matt persuades the posse's leader Quincey  that they've been caught, and the posse rides off. Matt and his men continue on, but at one point the mules bolt from the wagon an the rebels are forced to commandeer a stagecoach carrying a former Union war nurse Molly Hull  and her companion Lee Kemper . Quincey's posse returns and chases the stage to a station house, capturing one of Matt's men, Cass Browne , in the process. They drag him through the brush in an effort to discover the location of the gold. Meanwhile, Matt and his men take the stage passengers, the aging station agent Plunkett , and his daughter Margaret Harris  hostage. Inside the station house, when Kemper accuses Matt and his men of having murdered all of the Union volunteers guarding the gold shipment, Matt explains that they were carrying out a military mission, acting under orders, and that men died on both sides. Margaret is unmoved by the explanation, embittered over the loss of her husband and son in the war. Molly and Kemper remain suspicious, but Molly tends to one of the wounded rebels. Matt then addresses Quincey's posse who have surrounded the station house by now, trying to convince them that the gold is hidden near the abandoned wagon. As night descends, Matt asks each of the hostages to give him their word that they will remain silent while he and the men slip out in the dark. As they leave, Kemper yells out a warning to the posse, and Matt and his men are forced back into the station house. Matt prevents the violent Rolph from killing Kemper. Later that night, the posse try to lure the Confederates out by threatening to hang Cass, but Matt is able to rescue Cass using the remaining sticks of dynamite from their ambush. The following day, Kemper offers Matt a way of escape in exchange for two gold bars. Giving Matt an Indian token, Kemper explains that his good trading relationship with the local Paiute Indians and this token will guarantee fresh horses and safe passage out of the territory. He also knows by the approaching clouds that a brief torrential rainstorm will soon arrive and supply Matt and his men cover for their escape. Matt agrees to the plan. Later, while Molly is caring for the wounded man in another room, Rolph tries to force himself on her. An enraged Matt stops him and a fistfight ensues. After Rolph is beaten, Matt moves to console Molly. When an angry Rolph tries to shoot Matt, young Jamie Groves  shoots the gun out of Rolph's hand, and when Rolph picks up the gun and tries again, Jamie shoots him dead. Meanwhile during the night, Quincey and his men have been digging a short tunnel under the station house. Just when they break through and reach a trap door in the floor the station house, Cass stops them from entering. Frustrated, Quincey decides to burn the station house down and orders his men to torch the roof. When one of his men tries to leave, he shoots him in the back. As the fire burns through the roof, Kemper's predicted thunderstorm arrives. In the confusion, Kemper tries to escape with his two gold bars and is shot dead by the posse. When Cass sneaks outside to scatter the posse's horses, he is also killed. As Matt and Jamie prepare to escape, Molly begs Matt not to take the gold. Outside in the chaos of the storm, Quincey and his men begin shooting at each another. Believing Matt has escaped with the gold, Quincey races after him into the night. The next morning, the surviving members of the posse are gone. Respecting Molly's wishes, Matt and Jamie surrender the gold to Plunkett. Margaret and Plunkett offer a home to young Jamie who promises he will return. Matt also promises Molly that he will return to her after he is repatriated in Virginia, and the two embrace.
