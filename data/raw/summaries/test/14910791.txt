Kasam Paida Karne Wale Ki is the story of Satish Kumar. After the passing of his father, Satish is the only heir to a vast estate. As he is five years old, he can only inherit it fully when he becomes 20. The estate is placed under the care of his paternal uncle, Udaybhan, who carefully drugs and intimidates Satish to such an extent that Satish is terrified of his uncle's shadow. Years go by. Satish has achieved adulthood, is married to Aarti, and continues to live in fear of his uncle. After one night of bliss, Satish finds out that Aarti had married him to rob him of cash and jewelry. He is devastated. Uday asks Aarti to leave, and Satish follows her. Aarti asks him for forgiveness, and he does so. However, Udaybhan knifes him to death and has it written off by the police as suicide. Aarti swears to avenge this through her child in her womb. Years later, Aarti and her son, Avinash, surface to avenge Satish's death &mdash; they find out that it is not easy to hoodwink a wily Udaybhan, and they could well be endangering their very own lives.
