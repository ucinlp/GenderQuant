Young Pei Fen goes from mainland China to Java. In her father's book Youn Lun Fah, she has read that a jar with Gautama Buddha's ashes is hidden in the temple of Borobudur. The temple's guardian, Gandha Soewasti, unsuccessfully forbids her from looking. When Young is out searching, betel juice drips onto her. Thinking that Gandha is behind this, she finds the guardian and beats her with a chair. Gandha's friend Koesoema tries to have vengeance on Young with black magic, but Gandha uses her own magic to stop him. In the temple, Young finds a doorway leading down. However, she collapses after poisonous gas leaks out of the room. Gandha rescues her and reveals that she owed a life debt to Young's father, Lun Fah, who had rescued her from a bandit thirty years previously. Gandha had also given Lun Fah the book. Young decides to abandon her search for the ashes, and instead leads an ascetic life as a guard to the temple with Gandha.
