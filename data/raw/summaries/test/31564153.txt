Shaitan starts off with Amy , who is mentally disturbed and deeply affected by the attempted suicide and eventual institutionalization of her mother. She moves from Los Angeles to Mumbai, where she meets KC  at a party her parents forcefully take her to. KC introduces her to his gang &mdash; Dash , Zubin  and Tanya . They lead a directionless life, having fun, drinking, using drugs and driving around in a Hummer. On one such occasion, they start racing a random car and win but, in the celebration rush, they run over two people on a scooter killing them instantly. They quickly leave the spot but are easily traced down by a slimy cop, Inspector Malwankar, who demands Rupees 25 lakhs to make the case go away. Dash tells them about a friend  who faked his own brother's kidnapping and pulled out 20 lakhs from his own parents. Therefore, they hatch a plot to kidnap Amy, who volunteers. Amy's father immediately approaches Police Commissioner  for help. The Police Commissioner assigns an uptight cop Arvind Mathur  to solve the case unofficially as he is suspended after he throws a corporator from the first floor of his own house for allegedly beating up another woman. Inspector Arvind Mathur is shown having a disturbed married life and nearly divorces his wife. Amy's kidnapping quickly turns into a media circus, which puts pressure on the youngsters who go on a gruesome and disturbing killing spree. KC kills a man who attempts to rape Tanya, and the police inadvertently solve a case involving kidnapping of a German girl whose description matched Amy's. Tanya freaks out and convinces Zubin, who has feelings for her, to take her home. Zubin goes to bring a cab. Amy finds cocaine in Dash's satchel. Under the influence of cocaine, Amy catches Tanya on Zubin's phone and assumes that she had called the police, while she had actually called her sister. Amy acting aggressively gets into a fight with Tanya while KC intervenes and knocks Tanya to a nearby wall in anguish. When she accuses him of getting all of them in trouble, she is left unconscious in a pool of her blood. Zubin discovers this and quickly flees from the spot in fright and is eventually found and arrested by the police. Later Dash discovers the scene and escorts KC and Amy away to a church and instructs them to stay there. Meanwhile, Tanya is hospitalized after she was found by a sweeper. Zubin confesses everything to the police, and they trace down Malwankar, who is nearly killed in the chase. Then police trace Dash, KC and Amy to a church when KC had called his father on seeing his sister being traumatized by the insensitive media and requests him to help them out. Dash, however, is reluctant to KC's action and kills KC after their disagreement turns into a bloody fight. Dash tries to force Amy to run from the scene but is killed by Amy, now high on cocaine, who has a violent flashback about her dead mother trying to drown her , while Dash holds her down in the church. She stabs Dash to death, ending the mayhem. The police finally wrap up the case declaring that all four friends were kidnapped by Dash. To save the reputation of the police force, the commissioner clears the name of Inspector Malwankar by saying that he was injured while solving the case. Inspector Arvind Mathur reunites with his wife after she returns to him.
