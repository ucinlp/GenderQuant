Five years after the first film, Crown Princess of Genovia Amelia "Mia" Thermopolis  has just graduated from Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School and is returning to Genovia with her bodyguard Joe  and beloved cat Fat Louie. There, she will await her reign once her grandmother, Queen Clarisse , abdicates from the throne. During Mia's 21st birthday party, she dances with all the eligible bachelors in hope of seeking a husband. She happens to meet a handsome young gentleman  by accidentally stepping on his foot. After saving her from a dysfunctional dance, the charming man introduces himself as Nicholas. During the course of the night, Mia's tiara falls off and is caught by Parliament member Viscount Mabrey  who secretly plans to steal Mia's crown. The next morning while Parliament is in-session, Mia explores the castle. She stumbles upon a hidden room that allows her to secretly listen in on Parliament's session. Viscount Mabrey reveals that his nephew, Lord Devereaux, is another heir to the Genovian throne. Despite Queen Clarisse's objection, the only way Mia can assume her duties as Queen is if she marries within the next 30 days. Clarisse invites Lord Deveraux to stay at the palace, stating that if any mischief goes on she will want to know about it. Mia is shocked to discover Nicholas is the man with whom she flirted with at the ball. Enraged, she stomps on his foot, this time on purpose. Clarisse confronts Mia demanding an explanation for her behavior and she confesses her and Nicholas' history. Clarisse says that as her Queen, she cannot condone Mia's behavior, but as her grandmother she completely agrees. Mia's best friend Lilly Moscovitz  surprises her and comes to Genovia. Together, they pick through all potential husbands, including  Prince William. Mia eventually chooses Andrew Jacoby , Duke of Kenilworth and days later they are engaged. Mabrey plans to dissolve the engagement by instructing Nicholas to pursue a romance with Mia, which he willingly does. For a ceremony, Mia is to ride sidesaddle but does not know how. Queen Clarisse puts this worry to rest by presenting a wooden leg decoy to make her seem she is riding sidesaddle. Mabrey spooks Mia's horse with a rubber snake and Joe rushes to Mia's aide, but accidentally tears off the leg which lands on the ground. Humiliated, Mia flees to the stables, where Nicholas finds her and tries to comfort her, which Mia misconstrues as an insult. Later, at a garden party, Mia and Nicholas quarrel about Mia's relationship with Andrew. Nicholas tricks Mia into admitting that she is not in love with him. Angered, she follows him to argue but instead gets bombarded by a kiss. At first, she kisses back but then backs away. Nicholas pursues her even more, which causes both of them to fall into a fountain. Queen Clarisse finally tells the soaked Mia that her behaviour with Nicholas needs to stop. During the Genovian Independence Day parade, Mia sees some boys picking on a little girl. She abruptly halts the parade, and goes to comfort the girl, while the boys who run off. Learning that the children are orphans, Mia has a vendor give them all tiaras and lets them walk with her in the parade. Everyone, especially Nicholas, is impressed by her act of generosity, while Mabrey is disgusted at what he sees as a political maneouver. Mia later decides to build a temporary children's centre at one of the royal palaces with the help of Parliament member Lord Crawley  and his architect twin brother, Dean . That night, Mia has her bridal sleepover party, where Queen Clarisse surfs on a mattress and sings a duet with Princess Asana , one of Mia's good friends. Nicholas begins to have second thoughts on sabotaging Mia in order to become King. Mabrey realizes that Nicholas has fallen in love with her, but Nicholas says that Mia will never have feelings for him. Mabrey claims to only want Nicholas' happiness. Nicholas comes upon Mia as she is practising her archery as part of her coronation rites. He helps her succeed in getting the arrow to hit the target, something she had been struggling with. Nicholas then informs Mia that he is leaving, but asks to see her just one more time before he goes. She declines, saying she is under close guard. That night, Nicholas appears outside Mia's window and asks her to come down. Lilly encourages her to go, and Mia climbs down the vine. They ride out to a lake where they share secrets, dance and eventually fall asleep in each other's arms. The next morning, they awaken to a find a man in a boat videotaping them. Mia thinks Nicholas set her up and angrily storms off. By the time she gets back to the palace, their scandalous footage is broadcast on Genovian breakfast television. Andrew is disappointed but tells Mia he still thinks their marriage could work. Hopefully, he kisses Mia and asks her if she felt anything to the kiss which she says no. They realize they do not love each other, but do not call off the wedding because Andrew said he would marry Mia and that a gentleman never breaks his promise. The wedding is to take place the following day, and Mia's mother Helen  comes with her new husband Patrick  and their newborn son Trevor. Paulo  arrives promptly to do Mia's hair. Right before leaving for the wedding, Nicholas debates on whether he should attend, and Mabrey ends up leaving without him. Their surly housekeeper Gretchen, informs Nicholas that it was Mabrey who engineered their televised scandal. Nicholas rushes to the church, first on his grandfather's old penny-farthing bicycle before getting a horse from a local farmer. Moments before the wedding, Joe informs Mia that Nicholas did not set her up. As she walks down the aisle, Mia finds it difficult to go through with the marriage and rushes outside to catch her breath. Queen Clarisse follows and encourages her to not make the same mistake she made about giving up on true love. Mia reenters the church to break it off with a relieved Andrew and she addresses the attending members of Parliament. Mabrey stands up and, citing the nation's law, once again suggests that Nicholas be named monarch, only to be interrupted by Nicholas saying he refuses the crown. Mia proposes that the law on royal marriages be abolished, and Parliament unanimously gives its assent. Mia tells her grandmother to have her own happy ending. Joe says that since the guests came to see someone get married, he proposes to Clarisse, and they are promptly married by the Archbishop. About a week later, Mia is preparing for her coronation when Nicholas shows up. He professes his love for Mia on bended knee, and they kiss. The next day, Mia is crowned "Amelia Migonette Thermopolis Renaldi, Queen of Genovia", with all in attendance in the royal palace. An epilogue shows that Genovian Parliament now allows female members, one of which is Charlotte. Queen Mia officially opens the children's home as she had planned to.
