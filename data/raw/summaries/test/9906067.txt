This film opens with police officer Jimmy Mercer  and his partner  doing some undercover work, when Mercer's partner is shot and killed by a new man, Ronnie  that criminal Red Diamond  pulled out of jail. Now on a snap of anger and thoughts of revenge, Mercer wants to find the killer and take him down before he gets transferred to another precinct. Although a cop and close colleague claims over dinner that Mercer must do it "by the book," Mercer replies that "when I'm done with this motherfucker, I'm gonna put him in a box..... by the book." Red continues to try to build a relationship with one of his old girlfriends but fails. Through explosions and action, Mercer's temper rises with the suspense. At a club which Mercer is at, coincidentally at the same time as Red and Ronnie, the latter pulls out his gun on the second floor, to which Mercer quickly reacts by unloading all six rounds of his snubnose .38 into Ronnie. Red is arrested. Justice is served.
