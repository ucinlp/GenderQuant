It is basically an investigative film as CBI officer Kasi Viswanath  is entrusted to investigate the mysterious disappearance of Judge Sadasivam . The Kasi Viswanathan team comprises junior officer Kesavan Nair  and a constable . Soon Kasi finds out that a state minister Elakyam  is behind all crimes in the city and he is assisted by three senior cops. Suddenly one by one the bad cops are killed, with needle of suspicion resting on Kasi as a look-alike is behind the murders. It is revealed that it is a revenge killing by Perarasu , Kasi’s twin brother. We are told in a flashback by the family retainer  that Kasi was the long-lost twin brother of Perarasu and their father, the local chieftain , was at one time the king maker of Panchalakurichi. After making Mansoor Ali Khan and Prakash Raj, MLAs he falls out with them and they murder him. Perarasu who has seen this murder now wants to take revenge. All this led to a gripping climax in which the brothers are pitted against each other. The patchy storyline serves as a pretext to spark skirmishes, fights and punch lines. It has a fairly exciting climax. Captain Vijaykanth dominates the film and is in blistering form. Prakash Raj as the buffoon villain who loves Karagattam dances brings the house down with his one-liners and is perfect foil for Captain. Anand Raj as the Malayalee officer in a comic role shows his mettle. Heroine Debina Bonnerjee has nothing much to do other than be crazy about the CBI officer and play around with some children. It is a straight rip-off from one of Vijaykanth's his previous film Ramana. Anil Malnad’s editing makes the film racy.
