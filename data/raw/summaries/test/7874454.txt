When a schoolteacher is sacked, he projects his bad mood at his troubled teenage son. The son, in turn, buys a CD player from a pawnshop with counterfeit money. This starts a chain reaction of misery as every victim projects his problems on to another person. The film plot is based on http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0866243/ on Leo Tolstoy's "The Forged Coupon" part 1 like Robert Bresson's "L'Argent".
