In the Goutte d'Or neighborhood of Paris, North African immigrants share a tiny apartment amongst their French neighbors. The two communities get along uneasily, their relationship rife with misunderstandings and mutual offense. Salah , from the southern Maghreb, is a witness to this immigrant life in Paris and to the day to day incidents which make up the life of his compatriots. They, excepting those willing to pursue a life of petty crime, live a life of tedium and depression. French racists in the area escalate tensions with a series of attacks that end in a double murder. Salah, with the help of his friends, decides to organise protests against the injustice they face.
