Featuring images of Weston Manor in Totland, Isle of Wight in 1999, Richie and Eddie  run the worst guest house in the United Kingdom, neighbouring a poorly maintained nuclear power station. The chef is not only unable to cook, but is both an idiotic drunkard and an illegal immigrant and eventually leaves due to not being paid. The guests are totally unsatisfied  at the poor service, and all decide to leave, except for one "Mrs Foxfur"  who lives there. Life seems bleak for Eddie and Richie, but things seemingly improve with the arrival of the "Nice family", with Simon Pegg  playing the father. Furthermore, the famous Italian actress "Gina Carbonara"  comes to stay in the grotty house seeking safety from her ill-tempered fiancé Gino Bolognese . However Gino does eventually find her at the guest house as Eddie and Richard had put her name up in lights outside in order to attract more guests. Later, Richie finds some fish, which fell off a military lorry heading away from the nuclear power station. Richie and Eddie don't realise that the fish had been contaminated by a radiation leak until they feed them to the guests. Hours later the guests are expelling huge quantities of green vomit at high velocity — all except for Gina Carbonara, apparently the only guest who did not eat the fish. In the resulting chaos, Gina's violent boyfriend is propelled out of a window into the sea by a tsunami of vomit from the rest of the guests and drowned. Government agents arrive to hush up the incident and give Eddie and Richie ten million pounds, first class tickets to a Caribbean island and new identities for both the duo and Gina in exchange for their silence over the leak. The three accept the offer, and head to the Caribbean.
