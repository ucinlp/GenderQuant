This film begins with Nicholas Tse's character, Fung, waking up and getting ready for work as a mail man. During this he explains his life and the illness that has inflicted him. When Fung was younger, he got an illness that permanently took away his ability to hear and feel, even hearing aids will not help him. For Fung he has to read lips in order to understand what someone is saying to him. As he gets ready for work he is in the bathroom brushing his teeth while all of a sudden he smells something from behind him. It was his roommate Buddy who had an emergency and rushed into the bathroom, even though Fung was still in there. Fung reprimands his roommate and tells him that next time he better tell him that he is in the bathroom. Buddy defends himself by saying that he knocked but Fung did do or say anything so he took it as that it was ok to go inside. With this Fung leaves the bathroom and goes and gets his watch, it's special because it helps him hear better. Now that he is ready, Fung leaves his apartment and goes to work. When Fung gets to the Postal Office he receives a bag full of mail and packages that he must deliver by the end of the day. After a long day of delivering mail and packages he has one left to deliver, which is far away from where is now so he takes the subway. After getting on the subway he sits next to a young woman. Then out of nowhere this man in a business suit walks in, sits next to Fung, and talks to him, calling Fung Brian. Fung who is shocked that a random person would do this he politely says that they've never met and he is not Brian. Now the man notices Jane sitting next to Fung and declares that she is Fung's girlfriend. Both Fung and Jane deny this while the man is joking about the situation. Fung has had enough of this man, so he grabs Jane's hand and takes her out of the subway to get away from that man. Once they're outside Fung quickly pulls his hand back and walks away. Soon after Fung left Jane leaves too. This is the first meeting of theirs that was brought by fate and destiny. Fung is now walking to a dance studio where he must deliver a letter to the dancers there. He begins walking down the stairs and while he's walking Jane is walking up the stairs too. For some reason Jane stops walking up the stairs and goes back. This would have been the second time by fate and destiny that they would have met. Fung continues to walk down the stairs and to the studio. When he gets into the room, he says that there is mail, but no one hears him. So he walks past a pile of shoes and toward the group of male and female dancers, who are stretching on the floor, and proceeds to give them the letter. Once they see him they all shout at him for wearing shoes on this floor, so he tries to remove them but they all shout at him not to move. With nothing else to do he gives the letter to the girl that approaches him and swiftly takes off his shoes. While he's taking off his shoes, the group of dancers all run around trying to read the letter that they just got. After Fung took his shoes off he walks away and leaves the studio. Back at the studio Jane finally walks into the dance studio and sees everyone trying to read a letter. The girl who got the letter rips it open and reads the contents. This is the letter that informs them that their dance studio has been accepted to be a participant in a tournament that is a little more than a week away. They all cheer and celebrate their acceptance into the tournament, as Jane sees Fung walking away from the dance studio.
