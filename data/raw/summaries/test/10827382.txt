Two bored housewives have affairs with two different men that they meet in online chatrooms. As their online relationships develop offline, they often pass each other unwittingly in the hallways of the motels where they meet their lovers. One day, the lady known as “Dew” is in a motel room with her college-aged lover. Suddenly, her husband bursts through the door, along with police officers that he has brought along. The other lady, known as “Small Bird”, is in an adjacent room listening to what’s going on in Dew's room. Small Bird whispers to her lover to be quiet, because the police officer in the other room is her husband.
