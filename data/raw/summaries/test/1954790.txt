Pamela defies her autocratic father , and has a baby out of wedlock with her lover, Gerald Waring . Pamela raises her illegitimate daughter as her niece after her pregnant sister  falls and dies over the death of her young husband and becomes a crusading journalist for women's rights. Eventually she agrees to marry diplomat Thomas Lane  after being unfairly named as co-respondent in Waring's divorce. Hepburn's performance as the defiant young woman is considered the epitome of her feminist characterizations of the 1930s.
