The son of a wealthy Greek immigrant, Nick Stratton  is attempting to find his own way in the world. His father, Pete Stratton  is a self-made millionaire in New York City in the 1950s and important in the Greek immigrant community. Pete loves his son but he tries to buy his love and dominate his life like he does his employees and business associates. Nick struggles to assert his own identity but the family pressure and his love for his Father are very strong. Pete wants Nick to marry a nice Greek girl, the daughter of a business associate but Nick falls in love with Guilietta Cameron . He takes her as his date to his parents' wedding anniversary full of members of the Greek immigrant community. Pete tells him in no uncertain terms that Guilietta is a prostitute, whose services Pete and many of his friends, who are present at the party, have purchased. Nick tries to disengage from Guilietta but they are madly in love. Everywhere they go they keep meeting former clients of Guilietta's. Guilietta does everything she can to drive him away, hurting him and making him feel like just another "John" who now bores her, but she really doesn't want this. She wants him to prove his love for her. She is devastated when she succeeds in driving him away. She sees him in a bar after she has gone off with a former client and starts flirting outrageously and physically with every man she can find. Nick gets into a fight dragging men off her and is arrested. See the film to find out how it ends. It's an excellent multi-layered psychological drama with probably Gina Lollobrigida's best performance. Ernest Borgnine is also brilliant as is Anthony Franciosa. The milieu of the immigrant Greek society and the world at large is accurately depicted and very authentic. It appears to be a highly underrated film which has not received the critical acclaim it deserves.
