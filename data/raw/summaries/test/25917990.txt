A group of explorers go hiking in the forests of northern California. While exploring, they stumble upon an old mine which mined gold in the gold rush of 1849. In the depths of the mine, they find a large amount of gold that they, of course, take. However, what they do not know is that the gold belonged to a miner named Jerimiah Stone, who died in the mine. He has awaken from the dead and is planning on killing anyone who gets in the way of his gold, extracting revenge in whatever way he can.
