 Tracy Samantha Lord Haven  is a wealthy Main Line Philadelphia socialite who had divorced C. K. Dexter Haven , a member of her social set, because he did not measure up to her exacting standards.  She is about to marry nouveau riche "man of the people" George Kittredge ([[John Howard . Spy magazine publisher Sidney Kidd  is eager to cover the wedding, and he enlists Dexter, one of his former employees, to introduce reporter Macaulay "Mike" Connor  and photographer Liz Imbrie  as friends of the family so they can report on the wedding. Tracy is not fooled but reluctantly agrees to let them stay—after Dexter explains that Kidd has an innuendo-laden article about Tracy's father, Seth ([[John Halliday , who, Tracy believes, is having an affair with a dancer. Though Seth is separated from Tracy's mother Margaret  and Tracy harbors great resentment against him, she wants to protect her family's reputation. Dexter is welcomed back with open arms by Margaret and Dinah , Tracy's teenage sister—much to Tracy's annoyance. In addition, Tracy gradually discovers that Mike has admirable qualities, and she even takes the trouble to find his published stories in the library. Thus, as the wedding nears, Tracy finds herself torn between her fiancé, her ex-husband, and the reporter. The night before the wedding, Tracy gets drunk for only the second time in her life and takes an innocent swim with Mike. When George sees Mike carrying an intoxicated Tracy into the house afterward, he thinks the worst. The next day, he tells her that he was shocked and feels entitled to an explanation before going ahead with the wedding. Tracy takes exception to his lack of faith in her and breaks off the engagement. Then she realizes that all the guests have arrived and are waiting for the ceremony to begin. Mike volunteers to marry her , but Tracy graciously declines. At this point, Dexter makes his bid for her hand, which she accepts.
