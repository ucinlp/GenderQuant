The movie starts at what seems like a small house in a natural setting. Mickey walks out the door and says, "Oh boy! What a day!" Then, he pulls a lever and walks inside. The house is converted into a trailer  and Goofy's car is released from the side. Then, Goofy starts driving through the countryside while Mickey makes breakfast . Meanwhile, Donald can't wake up. Thanks to a secret controlboard, Mickey manages to rouse him for a machine-assisted bath. Later, the bath is converted into a dining area. When Mickey rings the dinner bell, Goofy foolishly leaves the driver's seat - while the car and trailer are still in motion - for breakfast. After several mishaps during the meal, Goofy accidentally and unknowingly unhitches the trailer in his panic to resume driving and goes on his way. The trailer rolls downhill on an epic runaway adventure, nearly crashes in several places and is a wreck by the time it's miraculously rehitched to the car. Unaware of the dramatic events, Goofy says in the end, "Well, I brought you down, safe and sound."
