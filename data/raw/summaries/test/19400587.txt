Anxious to go fishing, Spanky skips out of Sunday school, despite the admonitions of his pals Alfalfa, Mildred, Sidney, and Marianne that "Something's going to happen to you." Actually, everything happens to Spanky and his kid brother  in the course of the morning. Chased out of a private estate by cantankerous caretaker, the two boys wander into a dark, mysterious woods just as an eclipse occurs and at the same time a large group of black worshippers are holding a mass baptism ceremony. Some now insist on seeing the baptism and background singing of the Negro spiritual " Come out of the wilderness" as a racist stereotype. They miss the point that this story had a religious casting, Spanky skipping church, and going into the "wilderness". At worst it is an internal pun on the plot. The song is performed well and was most likely not intended to denigrate anyone. Inevitably, the kids scare the worshippers, and vice versa, culminating in a hectic chase.
