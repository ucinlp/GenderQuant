"Padmavyooham" is a Malayalam term  that represents a special type of army constellation. It is a top secret army deployment method which contains one entry point and one exit point which is difficult to locate. The film is about the mythological story of Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple, the design of the idol, and the temple's riches. The story is presented in the backdrop of Travancore royal palace and brings out the ideas behind the construction of the temple and the significance of the placement of the idol of Vishnu. Padmavyooham opens with a police probe into a few temple robberies and the death of a journalist who investigates the complex defence mechanism of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple. Following this, Adhitya Varma, the patron of the temple sets out on an expedition to find out the details of temple construction. The story develops based on the myth that the temple idol can work as a water valve to let the sea water in and out of the temple in case of an emergency. As in a "Padmavyooham", Varma's expedition runs into a series of events that unfold the relation between the famed Travancore ruler's vision, security features implemented in the temple, and the significance of the temple treasure.http://www.padmavyooham.com/#!__synopsis
