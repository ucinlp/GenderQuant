Jay Killian  is a senior member of the Secret Service. It's the day before the Inauguration of the new President, and Killian has just returned from a six-month sick leave. He's given a new assignment: to protect the First Lady, Lara Royce Craig . Being highly qualified and a seasoned veteran of the service, he's dismayed that he isn't on the Presidential detail. To make matters worse, Lara is a royal pain in the ass. She's arrogant, condescending, demanding, and she detests the presence of Killian. With the First Lady doing what she wants and ignoring all of Killian's suggestions, it becomes apparent that someone wants Lara dead—especially when a biker tries to shoot Lara. A wild cross-country adventure ensues as Killian attempts to protect Lara and flush out the assassin and his contractor—and the assassination attempts may have originated from the White House.
