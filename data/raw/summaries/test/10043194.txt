 The film tells of three women who live a nondescript apartment block in a chaotic world. Perla , her disabled daughter, Nena , and their next-door neighbor, Madrina  spend their days engaged in unrealistic conversations. For example, Perla dreams of resuming her study of the French language although she is in constant need of blood transfusions to delay her imminent death. The transfusions, are performed by a mysterious female staff member in a surreal stark-white hospital room, and provide rare glimpses of the world outside the block.
