Lives start to unravel during an eventful dinner party when the group are forced to face their issues head on. For one couple, vicar Dan  and his wife Emma  are faced with the revelation that one of them has been having an affair with the evening’s hostess Kate . Worse of all she has to in turn face her mother  who drops in to “help-out”. Drug fueled sex, lustful longings and how to make cous-cous… are there some things a girl shouldn't share with her mother? Even the therapist  has to face her own maternal misgivings as she returns home to deal with the aftermath of her own mother’s descent into Alzheimer’s - a startling performance by Jean Boht as Mary. Nina  explores the painful reality of having to care for a sick mother who, when she was well, appeared not to care for either Nina or her sister. A funny, honest and often tender look at the complicated relationships that create the unique bond between Mothers & Daughters.
