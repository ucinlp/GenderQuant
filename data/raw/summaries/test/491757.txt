On Mars in the year 2046, in the Union Aerospace Corporation  Olduvai Research Facility, scientists are attacked and pulled into the darkness by an unseen monster. Doctor Carmack ([[Robert Russell  transmits a warning about a Level 5 security breach before the door behind him is torn open. He turns around and sees a large humanoid creature through the gap. On Earth, a team of eight Marines -  known as the RRTS Hellfighters  are preparing to go on leave. Their leave is cancelled when the squad leader, Sarge , receives new orders. Contact with Olduvai has been lost and the RRTS is being sent to investigate. The Mars station is quarantined and the 85 UAC employees on Mars are not allowed to return to Earth. As the men suit up, Sarge pulls aside John "Reaper" Grimm  and asks him not to go because Olduvai is where Reaper's parents died and his sister is still on the station. Reaper suits up anyway, and their team is deployed to Mars via a teleportation device called the "Ark", located at Area 51. The Ark was discovered in 2026, and scientists have been studying it. The team meets an early victim of the Ark system, Pinky , who "went to one galaxy while his ass went to another" during an Ark teleportation event . They meet up with Dr. Samantha Grimm , Reaper's sister. She briefs the RRTS that Doctor Carmacks division of the facility focused on genetic research has been quarantined off, with Carmack and five other scientists sealed inside. Sarge instructs his team that their mission is to eliminate the threat, secure the facility and retrieve UAC property; Dr. Grimm going into the genetics lab with the squad to recover Carmack's research data. Reaper converses with his sister and learns that they discovered humanoid remains on Mars, which, unlike humans, have an extra chromosome pair which granted them invulnerability to disease as well as advanced cellular regeneration. The team locates Carmack, who has gone mad to the point of tearing off his own ear. They return him to the lab and Grimm sedates him. The Marines explore the facility, encountering two of the five remaining scientists only to discover that they have been transformed into zombies, forcing them to kill them. After spotting and chasing a large creature through the facility, the team follows it into the sewer system, discovering the bloodied lab coat of a 'Doctor Steve Willits'. Whilst the team is split up, an Imp ambushes Goat  and causes a mortal wound on his throat before being killed by Reaper and brought to Dr. Grimm, alongside the wounded Goat. Despite the best efforts of the RRTS, Goat dies in the lab. In response to the event, Sarge orders the 85 workers in the facility to evacuate back to Earth through the Ark with the exception of Dr. Grimm and Pinky, the latter being left to guard the Ark. After the evacuations are complete, Duke  remains with Dr. Grimm whilst she examines the remains of the Imp, and the two notice that Doctor Carmack has vanished from the infirmary. Moments later outside the lab they are attacked by an Imp which manages to lightly wound Duke before Dr. Grimm closes a nanowall on the creature, keeping it alive but trapping it halfway through the wall. Shortly afterwards, Dr. Grimm conducts an autopsy of the deceased Imp and discovers that it was once human. A second later Duke notices that Goat has returned to life as a zombie and broken free of the body bag containing him. Retaining some shred of his humanity and aware that he is turning, Goat prevents it by violently smashing his head into the observation room window to kill himself once again. Meanwhile, the rest of the RRTS return to the genetics lab and begin exploring the archeological digsite in the facility. While searching the caverns, the team discovers the bodies of two more of Carmack's scientists, leaving only Doctor Willits still unaccounted for. While Sarge and Reaper examine the bodies, Mac  is ambushed and immediately decapitated by the Hell Knight, the large humanoid monster seen prior. Convinced that the team is going to need some additional firepower to take on the creature, Sarge uses the severed hand of one of the scientists and takes the Bio Force Gun, dubbing it the "Big Fucking Gun." Elsewhere, Portman  leaves his post to use the restroom, leaving Destroyer  alone. In reality, Portman is going against Sarge's orders to maintain quarantine by sending out a transmission to Earth to request RRTS reinforcements. At the same time, Destroyer is attacked by the Hell Knight and thrown into a pit with electrified walls used as a prison cell. The two engage in a brutal melee fight before Destroyer manages to pin the Hell Knight to the electrified wall with a large pipe, attempting to climb a hanging chain out of the pit. Unfortunately as he reaches the top, the Hell Knight breaks loose and pulls the chain down, causing Destroyer to fall to his death. Shortly after the fight concludes, Portman successfully sends his transmission to Earth and is abruptly attacked by the Hell Knight which proceeds to hang him upside down from the ceiling and smash him violently through the stall walls. By time the rest of the RRTS arrive to help him he is dead and Sarge fails to hit the Hell Knight with the BFG before it retreats again. After being brought the bodies of Portman and Destroyer, Dr. Grimm determines that the genetics of the creatures have been altered by the addition of the 24th Martian chromosome, which led to their mutations and that the chromosome is spread by the ovipositors of those infected. She also reveals that the Imp trapped halfway through the nanowall is in fact Doctor Carmack, as identified due to his missing ear. She theorizes that the Imp killed in the sewers is the missing Doctor Willits. Losing his patience with Grimm, Sarge executes the transformed Carmack and interrogates her for an explanation of their research. After reviewing the research data Grimm collected from Carmack's lab, video footage is discovered which reveals that Carmack and his team deliberately injected the chromosome into a man named Curtis Stahl, a prisoner convicted of multiple murders before being given to the UAC instead of facing execution. The footage revealed that Stahl mutated into the Hell Knight, which led to him breaking loose and killing / infecting the research team. With four men KIA, the squad is reduced to Sarge, Reaper, The Kid , and Duke. The team realize that the Hell Knight is cutting through the vault door into the Ark in an attempt to escape to Earth. Sarge orders Pinky to detonate an ST grenade that Mac left him to destroy the Ark and prevent it from getting through. However, Pinky fails to and instead retreats through the Ark back to Earth and the Hell Knight chases him through. Sarge confirms the mission is no longer containment and orders the RRTS to head back to Earth to eliminate the Hell Knight. Reaper returns to the lab to bring Dr. Grimm, who reveals that the ovipositor of the creatures are selectively choosing what humans to infect. Reaper and Dr. Grimm theorize that the creatures pick up on genetic markers to make their decision, impulsively trying to infect people with "evil" tendencies  while ignoring those with more of a "good" personality . Dr. Grimm explains that the 24th chromosome would turn "good" people into super humans like the remains found on Mars, while those who are "evil" are turned into monsters. Meanwhile, the rest of the RRTS reach the UAC facility on Earth and find it full of corpses, the researchers from Olduvai and the base staff having been slaughtered by the Hell Knight when it came through. With the facility on automatic lock down to prevent anyone from leaving, the RRTS have a single hour before the lock down is lifted and the creatures can escape the facility. Sarge orders his men to kill anything alive in order to prevent the infection from spreading, leading them on a cleanup operation through the facility that leads them to kill a considerable number of UAC employees transformed into zombies. However, Sarge shows no distinction between targets and even kills survivors who do not show immediate signs of infection. While confirming the bodies in the facility are really dead, Duke discovers Pinky hiding under a pile of bodies and brings him back to the Ark chamber where Reaper and Dr. Grimm are trying to convince Sarge that not everyone is capable of being infected due to their "good" genes. Sarge doesn't heed them and prepares to execute Pinky before The Kid rushes into the room, stating that he found a large group of non-infected humans. Sarge orders him to return and kill them but The Kid refuses, resulting in Sarge executing him for insubordination. Reaper prepares to retaliate for the murder before Pinky aims a pistol at Sarge, ordering him to drop his rifle. The stand off is abruptly cut short when the Hell Knight enters the room, grabbing Pinky and fleeing into the halls with him in tow. The RRTS attempt to chase the creature down before they run directly into a horde of Zombies, making their stand at a nanowall that is malfunctioning and failing to shut. Duke is suddenly pulled through a vent in the floor by an Imp and killed while the zombies drag Sarge through the nanowall. Just then, the nanowall shuts and Reaper is hit in the gut by a ricochet from his own rifle. The two siblings flee the area and barricade themselves in a storage room. To save Reaper's life, Dr. Grimm injects Reaper with Chomosome 24. Instead of becoming a monster, Reaper awakens as a superhuman with enhanced speed, strength and healing abilities, his gunshot wound and other inflicted injuries having healed. Following Reaper's transformation and the discovery that Dr. Grimm is missing, the movie takes on a first-person shooter perspective. Within a few minutes, Reaper moves through the facility and slays an array of zombies and Imps, eventually having a showdown with the Hell Knight after severely burning it. Reaper successfully manages to kill the Hell Knight when he detonates a planted mine at its feet, blowing it to pieces. Shortly after, Reaper is attacked by Pinky, who has now transformed into a Demon after the Hell Knight infected him. After an intense and brutal fight, Reaper manages to incapacitate Pinky with the Hell Knight's chainsaw and proceeds to finish him off with his rifle. Switching back to a standard camera angle, Reaper emerges at the facility's exit. Bodies are scattered everywhere, and a melted blue hole in the wall, the mark of a BFG blast, is still cooling. Reaper finds Dr. Grimm lying on the floor, injured but alive. Sarge then appears, seemingly none the worse for wear, but Reaper notices the same injury on Sarge that Carmack had before he turned into an Imp. When asked what happened to the non-infected survivors, Sarge replies that he "took care of that problem"- he has killed them. Reaper tells Dr. Grimm to crawl to the elevator to the surface, intent on not letting Sarge leave the facility with the lock down only minutes from being lifted. After spending their last ammunition- Reaper's half of a magazine and Sarge's one round in the BFG, the two Marines battle hand to hand in the Ark chamber with their superhuman abilities. As Sarge manages to pin Reaper against a wall, he begins transforming, developing features such as a prominent skull structure, sharp teeth and yellow eyes. Without any other choice, Reaper activates the Ark and throws Sarge through, followed by a grenade. Sarge lands back in the Mars facility and soon notices the grenade. He and the Ark are obliterated in the explosion. Reaper retrieves Dr. Grimm, who is conscious but unable to walk, and holds her in his arms as he returns to the Earth's surface.
