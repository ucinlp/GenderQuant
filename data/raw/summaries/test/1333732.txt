The movie tells the story in pictures accompanied by the entire Brave record minus "Paper Lies" and the final song "Made Again". On the recording, it never really made clear that the girl the story is about commits suicide in the end. In the film, she does. Therefore, "Made Again", which concludes the story on the record as a happy ending of sorts, is not included. On the back of the cover of the videocassette, the following can be read: :Brave.. The Movie is a fifty minute concept film directed by cult movie director Richard Stanley. It is Stanley's stark vision of a young life in the 90's inspired by Marillion's album of the same name, which centres around a teenage girl who is found wandering in a state of amnesia on the Severn Bridge, and her consequent search for her past. Although this story bears similarities to actual recorded incidents in the history of the Severn Bridge we wish to stress that this is a work of fiction. On the bottom of the cover, the following lines can be read: "Watch it loud with the lights off."
