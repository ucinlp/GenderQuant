London, 1921. At a hospital receiving the war wounded and sick, a psychiatrist tries to help a young woman. One morning she finally manages to talk to him and whispers "I believe, in the devil". The surprised psychiatrist asks her to relate what happened at the mansion where she worked looking after two children. She begins to tell him everything. A few months earlier, the young woman, Ann, had been hired by a rich aristocrat to care of his orphaned nephew, Miles, and niece, Flora. Arriving at the mansion, Ann becomes the housekeeper, where she first meets Flora. Later, there are unexplained apparitions. A few days later, Miles, a very nice boy and good student, arrives at the mansion. Once the children have arrived, Ann discovers that they often make strange gestures. She learns that Miles cannot go back to school because he was expelled for good reason. After talking with one of the housemaids, she learns that the previous governess, Emily Jessel, and her lover, Peter Quint, both died under strange circumstances. She believes the children are possessed by the spirits of these two people.
