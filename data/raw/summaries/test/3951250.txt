The cartoon shows how the character, as the happy-go-lucky "Mr. Walker", undergoes a change in personality to the violent "Mr. Wheeler" when he gets behind the wheel of his car. As Mr. Walker he's good natured, while Mr. Wheeler, he is bad-to-the-bone. Upon reaching his destination in town  and leaving his automobile, he reverts to the mild-mannered Mr. Walker, whereupon he is the victim of other motorists' unsafe  driving habits. However, once he returns to his car, he becomes Mr. Wheeler again, seeking to impose his own will upon traffic, to the point of blaming the tow truck that hauls him away for his slow pace after an auto accident.
