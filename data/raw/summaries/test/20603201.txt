Now that Seaver children are out of the house, the Seaver parents, Jason and Maggie, attempt to sell their house, because they want to retire. They both have their own idea about what they want to do after the sale; Jason wants to buy an RV and travel the country, but Maggie wants to purchase an Italian villa. Ben is the real estate agent who is closing the sale, much to the delight of his new boss. Mike and Carol, however, are very much against it, and have both returned to the Seaver house, each with issues in their own lives that they are trying to sort out. On top of all this, Chrissy, now an aspiring rock singer, has also returned to the Seaver house, looking for a place to come to after having been evicted from her apartment and needing a place to crash while looking for gigs.
