The plot of the film concerns the potential outbreak of a Fourth Great Ninja World War when ninja with Kekkei Genkai abilities begin to disappear from Kumogakure, Iwagakure, Kirigakure, and Sunagakure. Konohagakure remains the only village not affected by these events - people start to suspect its role in these incidents, and rumors of a possible rebellion begin to circulate. With the other nations amassing troops on the borders of the Land of Fire and threatening invasion, the Feudal Lord of the Land of Fire orders Tsunade to capture the real culprit and prove Konoha's innocence; in the event of failure, the Land of Fire will be forced to destroy the village to preserve world peace. The true culprit and main antagonist of the film, Hiruko, is a missing-nin and former friend of the Legendary Sannin , who left Konoha long ago, after developing the Chimera Technique, a jutsu that allows the user to absorb both the chakra and Kekkei Genkai of other ninja. Based in Mount Shami with his followers, Ichi, Ni, and San, Hiruko uses a genjutsu to project himself onto the skies above Konoha, announcing that he will obtain the Kekkei Genkai of the Land of Fire and become immortal and invincible, then instigate the Fourth Great Ninja World War and conquer the world. With Hiruko intending to use the power of a solar eclipse to carry out his plan, a race to defeat him begins as the moment of the eclipse draws near.  Hiruko's target, the Land of Fire’s Kekkei Genkai, is Kakashi's Sharingan. One night, Hiruko activates a Puppet Curse placed on Kakashi over ten years ago. Kakashi asks Tsunade to allow him to go, so he can defeat Hiruko. Before he leaves, Kakashi asks Tsunade to place a special seal on him that will automatically activate Kamui when Hiruko attempts to absorb him. Under the influence of Hiruko's Puppet Curse, Kakashi leaves the village. At the Hokage's office, Tsunade labels Kakashi as a missing-nin and orders everyone from the village without any further orders from her to stay away from Kakashi. Upon hearing of Kakashi's desertion, Naruto and Sakura leave the village to pursue and rescue their teacher. Team 8, Team 10, and Team Guy are sent to retrieve them. Naruto, Sakura, and Sai follow Kakashi and defeat Hiruko's subordinates. Eventually they reach the temple where Hiruko is waiting for Kakashi. Naruto enters the temple. The eclipse begins, and Hiruko starts the absorption. Suddenly, Kakashi's Mangekyō Sharingan activates, and the space inside the slime created by the Chimera Technique begins to distort. Naruto saves Kakashi by breaking into the slime with multiple Rasengans and pulling him out, but Hiruko remains alive. He states that the eclipse hasn't ended yet and releases a large amount of chakra, reducing the surrounding area to rubble. Hiruko then summons a chimera beast. Team 8, Team 10, and Team Guy work together and defeat the chimera beast. Naruto and Kakashi battle Hiruko who easily absorbs their attacks, Raikiri and Ōdoma Rasengan. As a last resort, Naruto attacks Hiruko with Fūton: Rasenshuriken. Hiruko tries to absorb it, but cannot. He dies, and the Konoha ninja celebrate their victory at Mount Shumi.
