The story follows Yu Honda , a young teenage Catholic attempting to live his life in a faithful and orderly manner. His father, Tetsu, has become a devout Catholic priest following the death of Yu's mother, and operates his own church. Yu's father asks Yu to confess his sins, but Yu believes he is a good person, who has little to confess. At first he makes up sins, but his father sees right through him, and Yu sets out to commit real sins. Because of this, he falls in with a questionable crowd. Yu is taught by his new friends to steal, fight, and take stealth photographs up women's skirts. Yu promptly becomes a skilled "panty shot" photographer. He is perceived as a pervert, but he is never aroused by these photographs. After Yu loses a bet with his friends, he agrees to go into the city dressed as a woman and kiss a girl he likes. When they go into the city, Yu and his friends come across a young teenage girl named Yoko , who is surrounded by a group of thugs. Yu, still dressed as a woman, then helps Yoko beat up the gang of thugs. Afterwards he kisses Yoko and runs away. He falls in love with her â€“ the first time he's been in love with a girl- but Yoko falls for his disguise and develops feelings for his alter ego Sasori, or "Miss Scorpion". Meanwhile, Yu is being followed by Aya Koike , a member of the cult "Zero Church", who has become infatuated with him after she catches him taking a picture of her panties. Aya, who we are shown was sexually abused to the point that she became psychotic and set out on a series of violence sprees, including shooting every student in her class and cutting her father's penis off, devises a plan to bring Yu's entire family into the Zero Church, planning to gain the favour of Yoko by masquerading as Sasori. Aya manipulates those around Yu, and Yoko and Yu's family become caught up in the Zero Church. Yu desperately tries to free Yoko from the Zero Church by kidnapping her, but fails to persuade her to leave, as she does not trust him and is convinced he is a pervert. Armed with a sword, Yu then breaks into the building where the Zero Church are present and once again tries to escape with Yoko. Aya, who is present along with Yu's family, fights back, but resorts to suicide by driving the sword through her stomach. Yu is taken to a mental hospital, where he has forgotten all of his past and convinced himself that he is really Sasori. Yoko comes to visit, claiming that she now realises that she loves Yu, as he was the one always trying to save her. Yu cannot remember who she is, so security escort the hysterical Yoko out of the building. Moments later, Yu remembers who Yoko is, and is confirmed of his true male identity as he is aroused at the thought of Yoko. He escapes from the hospital and runs after the car that is driving Yoko away. The film concludes as Yu smashes open the car window and joins hands with Yoko.
