Set in October 1920, it tells the story of Major Dellaplane, a man whose job is to find the identities of unknown dead soldiers after World War I. Dellaplane forms a relationship with a woman who is looking for her missing husband, but a dilemma begins when he learns that her husband may still be alive. The movie is a sensitive examination of the deep psychological scars left behind by the Great War, clear of sentiment yet with delicately nuanced irony.
