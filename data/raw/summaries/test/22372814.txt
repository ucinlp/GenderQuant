The Goofy Gophers are about to harvest the carrots in a farm's carrot patch when the farmer beats them to the punch . Worried that their food source is being "vandalized," they follow the truck to the barn so they can recover what they consider to be their food. After waiting for the farmer to leave, they run into the barn to reclaim their stolen property, but they spot Barnyard Dawg sleeping in front of the truck and retreat outside. As Tosh points out how they would never stand a chance against Dawg if he woke up, Mac explains that the best way is to take back the vegetables is get Dawg out of the barn and he has just the plan to do it. First, Mac lowers a big pot lid over Dawg so that Tosh spreads banana peels over the floor and whacks the lid with a mallet. Shaking from the vibrations, Dawg slips over the banana peels and straight into the water trough where he finds himself face to face with a deadpan pig. At this point, Tosh is eager to reclaim the vegetables, but Mac reminds him that Dawg will return, from which they will initiate Phase Two of their plan to wear him down psychologically. Sure enough, Dawg returns and looks in the mirror, but finding nothing wrong, just shrugs it off and goes back to sleep. The Goofy Gophers then carry out Phase Two, which involves Tosh taking a rope through the pulley of the well and tieing it to Dawg's tail while Mac ties the other end to a large hay bale. As soon as they are ready, Mac pushes down the hay bale so that it drags Dawg out of the barn and drops him in the bucket so he falls down into the well. Dawg manages to pull himself out and finds himself face to face with the deadpan pig again and gives a disturbing chuckle . Confused, Dawg returns to the barn and picks out a book titled "The Significance Of Dreams" written by Dr. Sigmund Fraud. When Chapter 4 recommends that Dawg must convince himself that what he experienced was just a nightmare that never happened, Dawg laughs it off and settles back to sleep. The Goofy Gophers then initiate Phase Three of their plan . They saw a hole in the floor  and take Dawg to the pond, where they agree it will be a real shock for him. Sure enough, a duck in a bad mood swims up to Dawg and gives a rude quack, which startles Dawg into waking up and seeing his new surroundings. As Dawg begins to shake, the duck swims nervously away  and Dawg runs out of the pond screaming. Now completely shaking all over, Dawg takes out a box of Easy Doze It Sleeping Pills, of which he consumes the whole boxful and drops off to sleep. Once Dawg is fast asleep, as part of Phase Four, Mac wraps a girdle around him and ties it to a cord attached to a hot air balloon, which Tosh fills up with helium. As the balloon carries Dawg away, it snags on the pointed end of the barn roof and tears a hole in itself. With Dawg gone, the Goofy Gophers reclaim their carrots as well as some other vegetables the farmer picked and return them to their hole via a pipe rigged to go from the barn to the hole. Meanwhile, several miles away, the leaking balloon sets Dawg atop a telephone pole. After the cord snaps, waking up Dawg, he finds himself face to face with a crow that's flying by and sees the deadpan pig down below. Now completely confused over what's happened, Dawg mentally snaps by pulling a series of poses and faces, to which the crow shrugs off Dawg's behavior and flies away. Seeing the crow leave, Dawg calls out "Hey, wait for baby!" and, literally, flies off after the crow. At this point, the deadpan pig  also mentally snaps by trying not to smile. Later, in the big city, the deadpan pig has gone to see animal psychiatrist Dr. Cy Kosis  over his mental problem. Just as Kosis is trying to explain to the deadpan pig that dogs don't fly, he happens to spot Dawg go flying past his window. Straight after that, Kosis mentally snaps by dropping his notepad and pencil, joins the deadpan pig on the psychiatrist's couch, and tries not to smile .
