The four adult sons of Katie Elder – John , who is a famous  professional gunman, Tom , a professional gambler who is also handy with a gun, Bud , the youngest brother who is a college student, and Matt , who is a rancher – reunite in their hometown of Clearwater, Texas, in 1898 for their mother's funeral. They share regret that none of them has lived up to her high expectations of them. The townspeople are unfriendly with John, the gunfighter, and Tom the gambler. Katie Elder was extremely well liked by everyone in the community, who were all aware of her honesty, her poverty and her undying love for the sons who neglected her. The brothers want to do something for Katie's sake, and their plan is to send youngest son Bud to college, raising money through a sale of another man's herd of horses, even though Bud wants to emulate his eldest brother. Morgan Hastings ([[James Gregory  a gunsmith, claims ownership of the Elders' ranch after their father Bass Elder's death, claiming to have won it from him in a game of cards; Bass was afterwards shot in the back, and the killer is still unknown. Hastings hides a hostile attitude towards the brothers and brings in a hired gun, Curley , just in case. Gradually, the Elders suspect foul play. Hastings claimed Bass lost the ranch in a game of Blackjack, while John, in a ruse, states their father wouldn't have been caught dead playing Blackjack, as he decried it as a "woman's game" and claimed he would have shot any of his sons that he caught playing it. John's brother privately questioned John's story since they were weaned on Blackjack, and John states that Hastings wouldn't know that, foreshadowing the holes in Hastings' story. As it turns out, Hastings had indeed claimed the Elder ranch by murdering Bass Elder. When Hastings learns about the brothers' investigations, Hastings frames them for murder of the sheriff  and, not content with seeing them going to prison, arranges an ambush in which Matt is killed and Bud seriously injured. John and Tom take it upon themselves to avenge the family by going after Hastings. John gets him in the end by blowing him up in his own store.  William H. Wright picked up a copy of Life of the Marlows in a Los Angeles, California, bookstore in around 1953. Thinking that it would make the basis of a good Western, he paid members of the Marlow family $1,000 each for the rights to make it into a screenplay. But when the movie was made 12 years later, the film's plot had been drastically changed. Talbot Jennings was credited for the script.Rathmell and DeArment p. 6.
