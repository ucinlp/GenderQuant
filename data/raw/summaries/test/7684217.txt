According to an opening title card, this film is based on a true story. A group of oil prospectors travel to the island of Mindanao, but a rough landing damages the plane. While the plane is being repaired, prospectors Robert Harper  and Rolf  find the remains of the original prospecting team's camp, which is abandoned. Later, one of their team goes missing. They go into the jungle to investigate, and the pilot  is killed. Robert and Rolf are then separated, and Harper is kidnapped by a "stone age" cannibal tribe. The tribes people take Robert back to their cave, then tie him up and strip him down to his underwear. A native girl  comes up to Robert and tears his underwear off, then two other natives fondle his genitals. The cannibals then attach Robert to a bungee-cord and repeatedly drop him from great heights. Robert is imprisoned in a small cave, and is continually humiliated and tortured by the cannibals over a long period. After realizing he is going to be eaten, Robert manages to escape with the native girl, then ties her to a cord and wanders around with her in the jungle. After she tries escaping, he rapes her. While escaping from a rainstorm in a cave, Robert finds Rolf, whose leg is infected with gangrene. The three of them wander through the jungle until they eventually find the landing field. As they descend towards it, the cannibal tribe finds them, then manages to kill and eat the native girl in an exceptionally graphic sequence. After Rolf is hit in the chest with a spear, Robert manages to kill one of the cannibals with a spear laced with cobra venom, then he pulls out and eats his liver in front of the other cannibals. After frightening them off long enough to make it to the plane, the two of them finally manage to take off. According to the film, the real-life Harper returned to the U.S. and settled down in Mexico .
