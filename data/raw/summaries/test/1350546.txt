The US east coast is suddenly struck by a type of a massive destructive force of nature usually only happening after a major earthquake in the Pacific and Indian ocean rims: tidal waves of the destructive tsunami type. Scientist and fiction author John McAdams is forced to attend a type of Department of Homeland Security conference which concludes the phenomenon must be man-made, quite possibly abusing the findings of John's secret former Sea Lion project, but leaves questions of who wants to and has the means unanswered. Indeed John and his colleague Sophie, a Québécois, soon find John set up for a murder of a potential whistleblower and are pursued by The FBI,Maine State Police and a pair of foreign ruthless assassins. Major destruction means major contracts for construction and coastal defenses, so building tycoons like Victor Bannister certainly have a considerable interest. The movie is two part mini-series originally aired in The UK . Sophie, a very successful Québécois Canadien actress and singer but generally unknown to viewers outside of Canada and France, was recently cast as a lead in the American ABC TV series "Pan Am."
