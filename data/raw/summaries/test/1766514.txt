Leila  and Charli  go to Rome for a summer job with four other people. After a few minor accidents, the twins are fired. Both girls are shocked, and so are the other interns. The sisters soon meet Derek Hammond, the owner of the fashion company. He re-hires them and the girls and Jamie stay at Hammond's for a few days. There, Leila meets a bad boy from New York named Ryan . The two soon bond and start to develop feelings for each other while Ryan comes out and tries to kiss her good night. Leila does not respond the same and she pushes him away. It is very clear that she likes him too, but she might have just broken up with her boyfriend back home and was not ready for a new love. The girls soon return to work and do very well. But soon another accident happens and this time it is much more serious. All six interns are fired. Soon after Leila returns with Ryan and the two reveal the plot. They use Charli's designs for the missing clothes. They tell Derek when he returns he already knew about this. They do a photo shoot where Mr. Tortoni comes too he re hires everyone but he is then arrested also the interns and Ryan are very proud of themselves. Jamie and Derek decide to take them all to New York. While Derek and Jamie as well as Charli and Paolo kiss. Ryan tries again with Leila leading to her smiling at him but says she'd rather have a hug. The two hug with huge smiles on their faces, showing that Leila did really like Ryan in that way. The photo shoot is still going on with everyone smiling and laughing.
