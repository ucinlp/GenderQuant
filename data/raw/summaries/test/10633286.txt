All of the women on the planet Mars have died in an atomic war, except for Martian Princess Marcuzan . Marcuzan and her right hand man, Dr. Nadir , decide they will travel to Earth and steal all of the women on the planet in order to continue the Martian race. The Martians shoot down a space capsule manned by the android Colonel Frank Saunders , causing it to crash in Puerto Rico. Frankenstein's electronic brain and the left half of his face are damaged after encountering a trigger-happy Martian and his ray gun. Frank, now "Frankenstein", described by his creator as an "astro-robot without a control system" proceeds to terrorize the island. A subplot involves the martians abducting bikini clad women. The title's space monster refers to the radiation-scarred mutation 'Mull' brought along as part of the alien invasion force. The Frankenstein android and Mull confront one another at the climax.
