A car containing a bullet ridden blackmailer's corpse is left in front of the police station. The daughter of a mayoral candidate had visited the blackmailer that day, and is brought in for questioning. A newspaper editor, who does not want that candidate to win, visits Lt. Carson and pressures him to tarnish the daughter's reputation until the election is decided. Carson resists. The corrupt medical officer takes orders from the editor, and is commanded to get the body out of the police station before anyone else learns that the blackmailer was poisoned before being shot. Some slapstick comedy ensues during attempts to smuggle the body out of the station. After further plot complications, the murderer and his motives are revealed. The mayoral candidate's daughter is cleared of suspicion before her father's chance in the election is ruined.
