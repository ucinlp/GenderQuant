A Garuda came down from his celestial residence to gamble with ancient king in a dice game. The Garuda saw the beautiful Ka kee who was the king's wife and stole her away. The king's musician helped her to escape by also seducing her. The King took offence at Ka Kee's unfaithfulness, for she had slept with three men. He punished her by sending her away on a raft that floated to the middle of ocean, sure that she would not survive her ordeal. The raft drifted on the deep seas until it arrived to an island while Ka Kee was unconscious, tired and hungry for months. A group of thieves saw her and the chief wanted her for his wife but Ka Kee woke up and escaped from them. Meanwhile the soldiers of a certain king fought all those thieves and took Ka Kee home but she refused cause she knew her fault and accepted her punishment. The new king was the former king's musician who had slept with Ka Kee and he declared his love openly to her. Finally Ka Kee went with the king and they lived happily together ever after.
