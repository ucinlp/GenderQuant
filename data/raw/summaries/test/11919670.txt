Azhagappan  is a member of a theatre group. One fine day an unlikely visitor from the heavens stumbles upon him and almost falls for him. The beautiful trio of the heaven – Ramba, Thilothama, and Urvashi – comes to the earth to enjoy its “beauty”. While the others get back to where they belong to at the right time, Ramba  loses her track and gets into trouble. Vadivelu accidentally helps her to go back to the heaven. She gets him to the heaven during the night and sends him back to the earth early in the morning.  Frequenting to the heaven and the hell gives Azhagappan an idea of what is happening in the other world. He is not serious about his rare opportunity to see the Devendran  and the deities but the death of a neighboring child changes everything. He takes thing seriously and wants to teach a lesson to the deity of death . Vexed with the death and the ways human beings are treated with in the hell, Azhagappan decides to tamper with the process of life and death. He wants to tamper with the laws of the gods. The gods get angry and Azhagappan pays the price. Comedy turns into tragedy, as he is transformed into a 90 year old whom even his mother  cannot recognize and Rambha is cursed to become a formless soul. Naradha , as usual, makes amends to bring up the climax. Devendran seeks Brihaspathi's counsel and a way to relieve both Azhagappan and Rambha from their curses is born. How this happens even though Yama tries his best to stop it from happening forms the rest of the climax.
