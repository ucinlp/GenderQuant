The film opens with the introduction showing the death of Dr. Gero at the hands of the Androids 17 and 18 including the Red Ribbon Army, but also reveals that Gero previously copied his consciousness into an underground supercomputer, working on an alternate ultimate android. Cutting to the present day, Goku is shopping with Gohan and Chi-Chi, while Krillin, Master Roshi, Oolong and Future Trunks wait for a beauty pageant. As Goku, Chi-Chi, Gohan and the gang eat in the restaurant on the shopping centre's top floor, two humanoid beings enter the city and begin causing mayhem. Oblivious to their surroundings, they head straight for the restaurant and attack Goku. Goku briefly fights them and realises that they are androids, since he cannot sense their energy. The humanoids introduce themselves as Androids 14 and 15 as Gohan, Krillin and Trunks join the fray. Goku requests that they take the battle elsewhere in order to avoid harming innocent people, and the androids accept, flying to an Arctic area. Goku and Trunks take on the androids and manage to hold their own until a red neck android wearing the Red Ribbon Army insignia appears. This android introduces himself as Android 13, and explains that Dr. Gero may be gone, but previously programmed his supercomputer to think that it is Gero himself to continue Gero's dream to killing Goku in revenge for defeating the Red Ribbon Army. Vegeta and Piccolo also show up to aid their friends. Goku, Vegeta and Trunks power up to their Super Saiyan forms. While Android 13 manages to hold the upper hand against both Goku and Piccolo, Trunks and Vegeta destroy Androids 14 and 15, and surround 13, ready to take him on at once. Irate, 13 proceeds to absorb 14 and 15's main cores into his own being and undergoes a hideous transformation into Super Android 13. In this form, nobody is able to match 13, and he pummels Goku and the others about. Seeing no other choice, Goku begins summoning energy for the Spirit Bomb while Piccolo and the others stall 13. 13 eventually gets wind of this and tries to stop Goku, but Piccolo holds him off just long enough for Goku to go Super Saiyan again and merge with the Spirit Bomb. 13 attacks, but Goku effortlessly punches through 13's stomach and sends him into the core of the Spirit Bomb, where he is obliterated. With 13's demise, the underground supercomputer shuts down for good. Following 13's death, Krillin and Gohan are sent to the hospital. There everyone jokes about Krillin's attempt to help Gohan's summer school . The film ends with Piccolo and Vegeta sitting on an iceberg, isolated from the celebration.
