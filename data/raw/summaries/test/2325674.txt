In World War 2 some American and Australian airmen tell the story of Charles Kingsford-Smith. It starts in 1917 with him recovering from a wound incurred in fighting over the Western Front. Kingsford-Smith is rewarded with the Military Cross and is determined to make a career out of flying. After the war he visits America and has a brief romance with Kay Sutton but later falls in love with and marries Mary Powell. He attempts to enter the England to Australia Air Race in 1919 but is stopped by Prime Minister Billy Hughes. He then decides to become the first person to fly from the US to Australia across the Pacific. He does the trip with Charles Ulm in a plane called the Southern Cross and becomes world famous. Kingsford-Smith attempts to set up his own airline but is not successful and is forced to take people on joy flights to make a living. He breaks another record, crossing the Pacific from the Australia to the US in a single engine aeroplane with P.G. Taylor. He almost dies flying to New Zealand with Bill Taylor and John Stannage, and retires the Southern Cross. In 1935 he flies from Australia to England and disappears over the Indian Ocean.
