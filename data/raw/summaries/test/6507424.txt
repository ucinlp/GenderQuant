In the near future, the entire world is struck with a bizarre malady which affects every girl between the ages of 15 and 17 years old. Victims first experience a period of giddiness called "Near Death Happiness"  before expiring. Within minutes of death the victim rises again as a flesh-eating zombieâ€”a "Stacy". These Stacies run amok until they are cut into pieces in an act called a "Repeat-Kill" . The government has organized the poorly-trained "Romero Repeat-Kill Troops," who ride around on garbage trucks, ordered to act out the disposal of the Stacies. By law, a Stacy may only be Repeat-Killed by her loved ones or the Romero Repeat Kill Troops. Through research, it is discovered that a key to the Stacy phenomenon is the "Butterfly Twinkle Powder"  that accumulates on the Stacies' skin.
