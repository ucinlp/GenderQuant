A body left in a dumpster by Mafia hitmen is discovered by financially troubled travel agent Paul Barnell . Heavily in debt and attempting to find a cure for his wife's apparent Tourette Syndrome, he stages a disfiguring animal attack with the body in order to cash in his missing brother's life-insurance policy, for which a corpse is required. Local police are convinced, but a promotion-hungry insurance agent  is not. The Mafia hitmen are also in search of the corpse for proof to collect their payment. They take Paul's wife  hostage to ensure that they will get the body. Paul stays in his brother's cottage. Paul's missing brother Raymond  returns home, beats him, and demands a portion of the insurance money. By suggesting the insurance agent has assaulted him, Paul speeds up the delivery of the million dollar insurance payment. He has the body exhumed and agrees to exchange it and a portion of the money for his wife. In fear that Raymond will attempt to kill his wife to keep her quiet, Paul considers killing his brother in his sleep, but cannot bring himself to do so. The next morning Paul leaves his brother asleep and meets the hit-men for the exchange. Raymond is angered at his brother's deception and arrives as well, and is told by the insurance agent, who has finally pieced together what has happened about his million dollar policy. Raymond then pulls out a pistol and shoots Paul's fleeing wife in the back. He is in turn shot in the stomach by one of the hit-men . Paul finds his wife alive, the insurance money he had hidden in his jacket his wife was wearing stopped the bullet. The brothers reflect on childhood memories as Raymond dies. Using the money, Paul takes his wife on a flight to a tropical location, his love for his wife being the sole motivation for the whole situation.
