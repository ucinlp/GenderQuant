= A teenage gothic band heads for a gig in a remote province. During the long journey, not many of the young band members talked too much, while, their manager Hans  keeps complaining why he's the one who should drive. Meanwhile, Tonee  and Ian , who were long-estranged couple, ignored each other. Vince , the band's leader and Richard  have a small commotion, only to be stopped by Richard's ex-girlfriend Dang . The group stopped into a small store beside the road. The others decided to relax while Vince and Dang disappeared from view. The two latter confronted each other; Vince revealed he will be leaving them soon, a fact that Dang objects strongly. Back at the store, Lucio , a local townsfolk, warned them to stay in sight, for they might be kidnapped by an engkanto . He then told of the story of his son Paeng : the latter was gathering firewood when he was suddenly grabbed by someone or something. He then also explained that the engkanto was the reason why they are lost in the middle of nowhere. Worse, the bus ran out of gas, forcing the band to take refuge in an abandoned resort. Dang, Ian and Tonee then encountered a young and beautiful woman clad in white. Tonee and Ian asked where is the beach. They followed the woman's directions but were lost. Tonee lost her temper but Ian wants to court the young woman. Accidentally, he was bitten by the woman, who revealed to be the engkanto . Vince then encountered Paeng, the aforementioned boy who was kidnapped by the engkanto. He, Dang and Richard demanded that who did this to him and who is this. As they speak, the engkanto summoned her slaves to hunt the band down. Hans, who was looking for gas, was bitten. Meanwhile, Dang met a retreating Tonee informing the former that Ian was killed by the engkanto and made her slave. Sadly, Tonee too was choked to death. Paeng and Vince then lured the slaves to the beach, discovering they fear water. They formulated a plan: he and Dang will ward off the slaves while Paeng, Richard and Tikoy  refilled the bus's gas. Paeng then noticed the tree beside them; this was supposed to be the engkanto's lair. They must burn it to kill the engkanto. The engkanto, who stopped in her tracks for she fears water, rushes to Richard and choked him hardly. The young man can hear what the latter was saying: he  was the one she need. Paeng, meanwhile tossed the matches in the air, burning the tree and killing the engkanto. With all things seem to be alright, the remaining band members visit Paeng's home where his father warmly welcomed him. But, something in their plans went horribly wrong: no matter the engkanto's home was burned down, she will only move into a new dwelling, for she is a spirit of the nature. Mang Lucio was right: Richard was kidnapped by the zombie engkanto and was never seen again.
