The cartoon begins with Mr. Meek carrying an axe in his hands. He turns to the audience and exclaims: "My wife, Sweetypuss, says if I don't have a roast duck for dinner, she'll cook my goose." The scene cuts to Daffy eating corn while singing "I Dream of Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair" minding his business. A shadow of Meek is show getting ready to chop off Daffy's head. Then he jumps and shout "Watch it, Bub!" directly in his face. After a brief talk to Meek, he flicks his beak at his face and marches to a hay stack. Meek chops the stack various times and on the last chop, he thinks he kills the duck. Daffy fakes his death by squirting ketchup and crying "You crushed my little head." This fools Meek by pretending he is beheaded and runs rapidly. Meek feels sad and goes back to his house, where Daffy is seen pouring coffee into a cup. Meek guiltly tells him that he has killed a duck. He cheers up Meek into giving him a cup of coffee and asks how much "lumps" does his wife usually give him. Meek shows Daffy a lump on his head and Daffy gives him another lump and some cream. Daffy dances on the cakes and pies, singing "Shortening Bread" and Meek replies "Say. That's that Daffy Duck." Daffy throws a pie at him, leading into a war between himself and Meek. Daffy goes into army plane mode, by dropping an egg on Meek as a "Secret Bomb Site." Next, he goes into battle weapontry mode, by making various sounds and smashing hosehold items. After all the fun and games are over, Meek gets mad, which causes the egg to fry on his head. Daffy runs off, but is caught by Meek with a shotgun. He puts it up to Daffy's face and orders him to get in the oven. Daffy goes into his stripper mode and performs a striptease to the tune "It Had to be You." The war continues through some parts of the cartoon, including a fortune teller . Going back to the curve run scene, Daffy says "No no. Not twice in a same picture." Meek blows the feathers off him and throws him in the oven. When he hears Daffy cries he fells guilty and opens the door. The cartoon ends with Daffy bathing himself in gravy saying "Say. Now you're cooking with gas."
