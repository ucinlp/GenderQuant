Paul is a German soldier who goes AWOL when the truck he is riding in stops at a fast food restaurant. He then returns home to where his older brother Max lives. Paul is immediately attracted to Max's girlfriend, Lene, and tries to entice her into a sexual relationship, but she refuses. Paul is shown to be angry and frequently loses his temper at those around him, including his brother, his old friend, and his ex-girlfriend. The military soon begins to look for him. After they arrive at his house, Paul runs to a nearby motel. Lene visits him, and they have sex in his motel room. Two military officers, along with Max, track him down at the motel, but Paul disappears.
