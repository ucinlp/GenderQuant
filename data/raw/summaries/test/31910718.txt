A beautiful real-estate agent Li Peiru  gets drunk at a karaoke bar and throws up on a righteous but lonely cop Fang Zhendong . Zhendong quickly feels a connection to the flirtatious Peiru despite the fact that she's having a torturous affair with a married man who happens to be her boss. The affair ends with Peiru finding out that her boss has been cheating on her with another employee. Peiru works hard to get funding for her business idea, and when she repeatedly fails, Fang  sells his house and puts up the money to fund her business. The business fails before it can even get started, and she finds herself destitute. Meanwhile, Fang has found out that an injury in the line of duty has resulted in an illness that's causing him to slowly lose his mental faculties. To make matters worse, Fang loses his job as a police officer after using an official vehicle for personal purposes. As she begins to recover from the loss of her business and the money it promised, Peiru begins to question her own materialism as she begins to appreciate the selfless support she has received from Fang. She realizes that she has fallen in love with the good-hearted Zhendong, but she is unable to find him since he moved and did not inform anyone of his new location. One day, when she has established herself in a regular job and is back on track to a normal life, Fang's friend comes into the business she works for and asks for her. She accompanies him to his home where he reveals that her things have been waiting for her since Fang left. He makes her promise she won't leave after meeting Feng in his progressively worsening condition. She agrees, and heads for Fang's new home. They meet, he cooks her dinner, and they reconnect. He insists that she move on since she has come at a time when he can no longer support her, but in turn needs her support and will need it more as time goes on. She stays and they eventually get married. Fang is painfully aware that his condition is worsening over time. Eventually, it gets to a point where he is unable to perform the functions of his job and gets lost on his way home from work. Upon arriving back at home, he finds out from Peiru that she is pregnant. As Fang's condition worsens, he finds himself forgetting more every day, which makes taking care of his new child difficult and frustrating. Fang happens to see a burglar coming out of a home near his, and gives chase. After a run through the back-alleys of his neighborhood, he is hit on the head with a brick and ends up in the hospital with serious head-trauma. After days of keeping constant vigil by his bedside, Peiru becomes sick and passes out just as Feng's heart stops beating. They both flash-back to earlier, better times. She awakens to Fang at her bedside apologizing for making her worry. They live happily ever after.
