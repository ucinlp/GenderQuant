Fresh trouble begins there. The landlady chases the girls out, saying a wandering soul is following them. The girls were harassed and threatened by their college mate Jithulal. Chacko accepts help of his friend Vinod Varghese , who promises to take them to a guesthouse out in the woods. Vinod actually had an agenda to cheat the girls by bringing them to Jithulal.

They took shelter at an old bungalow in the forest where they had strange experiences. Ram was a nuisance throughout their journey; however, Minu made a good company with him. Ram told her his stories. He was left only by a younger sister who went missing from Bombay which made him a drunkard and a psycho. After long treatment, Ram returned to his professional life and in one of his forest tours, he happened to visit a girl named kalyani who looked exactly as if his sister. He offered her to take her to Mumbai and she wholeheartedly agreed. But on the day they planned to left, she too went missing and the aborigines accused Ram for the incident. Ram searched for her throughout the forest but on another side of the jungle she was brutally raped by Jithu Lal. She was burnt alive by Jithulal and his friend Vinod. The spirit of the murdered girl followed the three girls. At sunrise, Chacko and Vinod informed the police inspector  Ram's missing. They were terrified to discover that Ram died when they met their accident. They returned to the forest house, and Minu once again tried Ouija board. Ram's spirit came to them and they fled the house; they discovered that Vinod was cheating them. The soul of Ram followed Vinod and killed him in a marsh.
