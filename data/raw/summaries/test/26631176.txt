At a small diner, several people are gathered. Noreen, a waitress, Lonnie, a cop, Jimmy, the owner, Billy and Starr, a couple on their way to elope, John, a salesman, and Hank, a quiet man. The radio is turned on and tells of four family members murdered gruesomely a county over. Noreen is shocked, wondering how someone could kill children. She talks to John, who reveals his wife died two years ago. Then she goes back to the counter and talks to Lonnie and Hank, complaining about her lazy husband. The cop flirtatiously offers to run away with her, but is rebuffed. A man in a black leather jacket comes in and sits. When his order of steak is denied, he gets angry, and Jimmy yells at him to leave if he doesn't like it. Noreen not so stealthily gets Lonnie to the back, and suggests the man could be the killer. The cop does not believe her, and the man approaches them to ask for more coffee. Noreen spills it betraying her nervousness, and Hank asks Lonnie to check out the man. Questioned, the man is antagonistic, belittles Lonnie and just wants to be left alone. Angry, Lonnie pulls a gun and demands answers, asking if he drives a black truck, but Hank confirms the man drives a red truck. Lonnie regrets his actions and apologizes, and explains. The man pays and leaves. Hank smokes in the bathroom, and Noreen and John talk. But the man comes back with a shotgun and kills Lonnie and Jimmy. He points it Noreen's face, but doesn't shoot after Noreen begs him not to. The man assembles the five remaining characters and demands their wallets, keys and cellphones. Noreen tries to keep one, but gets caught. Hank is ordered to drag Lonnie's body out. He doesn't want to, but does after being threatened. Afterwards, he says there are likely only 8 bullets in his handgun and 7 shells in his shotgun, and Hank wants everyone to rush him, but John is too scared. Greene comes in, and the man threatens him, but Greene stays cool and flippant, asking him if he finished the job, and gives him a suitcase of money. He tries to leave, but the man won't let him, saying he's not Smith. Greene is handcuffed to a chair, and the man asks about Smith and the money, but Greene doesn't want to answer, so the man beats him. When the shotgun is aimed at his crotch, Greene comes clean: he's a businessman who was buying up land to build a shopping mall. But one man wouldn't sell, worried about his partner wanting his money, he hired Smith to persuade the holdout. Smith killed the man, his wife, and his kids, the deaths on the radio. With no heirs, Greene could buy the land from the bank. After this, the man kills him. The man now suggests that one of them is Smith, and wants to know who. John volunteers to talk, but the man wants to talk to Hank first. He beats Hank, and sits him down without handcuffs. John plans with Noreen to get the gun away. Hank reveals he's an exsoldier and claims he's married, but the man shows him his wallet with a condom inside. Hank doesn't want to talk about it, so he's shot in the leg. In pain, he admits he has sex with men at truckstops, and claims he's Smith if he'll stop shooting, but the man kills him. Noreen asks him why he's doing this, but he says he just came in to get something to eat and 'just snapped'. John  after threatened, admits to be Smith and turns back the questioning, revealing the man is an ex-military man who was booted on psychological issues. The situation is now reversed, the man bargaining with John, who refuses to let the man go without all the money. The man panics, kills the couple, shoots John, and when he goes for the kill, Noreen comes from behind and cuts his throat. John asks Noreen for the key, but Noreen pulls the handgun, not trusting him. John taunts her, saying she doesn't have the guts and she's out of bullets. But Noreen, good at counting, knows and proves she has one left, and kills John.
