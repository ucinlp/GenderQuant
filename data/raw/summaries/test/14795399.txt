After a dramatic scene at the front, the two are apprehended by the MPs, and brought to Colonel Marshall, for justice. He readies the firing squad, but opts for the worst sentence he can think off, ordering them to marry Olga and Annette. After, the two point out that the "secret papers" they were carrying to the commanding General, was an actually a love letter from Olga to the very married Colonel. The Armistice has been declared, but as Wheeler & Woolsey say at the end, has it!
