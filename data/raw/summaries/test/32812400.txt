Returning home to Tennessee from a trip to Texas, nightclub owner and gambler Ron Lewis happens across a shooting and is nearly shot himself. A deputy determines that Lewis is involved and roughs him up, resulting in a fight that ends up in the deputy being badly beaten and Lewis placed under arrest. Corrupt cops, including a thieving sheriff, and lawyers  ignore Lewis' claim of self-defense and railroad him into a prison sentence of up to 10 years. His girlfriend Susan is sexually assaulted and warned not to aid Lewis' defense in any way. Behind bars, Lewis is befriended by mob boss Sal Viccarone and hit man Vince Greeson. He is paroled after four years and immediately sets out to get even with those who wronged him. Vince, also out of prison, is contracted to kill Lewis, but decides to help him instead, as does a law-abiding deputy, Sam Perry. Lewis proceeds to torment and even torture the guilty parties in a number of ways, gaining his revenge.
