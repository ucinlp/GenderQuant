Although he is scheduled to wed his boss George Salt's niece that weekend, Amalgamated World Metals vice chairman Cliff Barton is sent to London to do a business deal that will enrich the firm. Salt considers him a protege and intends to turn over control of the company to Barton someday, insisting to him that business always comes first. Cliff must hide the fact from Mr. Carew, who runs the British company, that Salt intends to unscrupulously assume control of the company rather than simply merge with it. And while following through on Mrs. Salt's request to drop by her pet London-based charity, Cliff learns that it is actually a front for prostitutes run by a German refugee named Miriam Linka. Although his loyalties are with the company and future father-in-law, Cliff wants no part of betraying Carew's trust. He also, against all odds, falls in love with Miriam and persuades her to return to America with him to be married. Salt angrily tries to spin the guilt so that it appears Cliff was the one defrauding the British, while false accusations fly that Miriam is not only a prostitute but a Communist as well. Cliff must fight for his reputation and the woman he loves.
