Mumbai-based Tanvi Sharma, married to Financer, Nikhil, for 3 years, is thrilled when she is not only promoted as Assistant Vice-President with her employer, ICBI Bank, but also tests positive for motherhood. But her joy will be short-lived when she must abort the child as it comes in the way of her promotion as Vice-President - the venue to power, position and wealth - as well as incur the wrath of Nikhil. The duo do make up, and decide to have a child through a surrogate who will live with them during the pregnancy period. A broker, Shukla, arranges a surrogate, Gauri, an impoverished village-based mother of two children, and the wife of an unemployed idol-artist, Mohan. While dealing with pressures of the stigma attached of nursing a child sired through another woman from family and friends, she must also deal with the fact that a naive Gauri may decide to keep the child.
