Baywatch lifeguards Mitch, Stephanie, C.J., Matt, Caroline and Logan travel to Oahu, Hawaii for a vacation and get caught up in a series of misadventures. Stephanie teamed up with a local lifeguard. Logan became obsessed with competing in a surfing competition which left no time for his girlfriend and fellow lifeguard Caroline. C.J. was called back to Baywatch, while Mitch and Matt took a boat trip to a remote part of Kauai where they were stranded after Matt was stung by a poisonous scorpion fish, and then they were captured in a remote village of local Hawaiians who had gone native. It also serves as David Charvet's last Baywatch appearance, spelling an end to his popular character Matt Brody.
