When Tommy Collins , an unemployed stripper living at his parents' home, finds out that his parents are going on a private getaway for a few months and taking the mobile home with them, he decides that he needs to find a place for him and his chihuahua Peanut to stay. By a stroke of luck he is called up for jury duty and he must be sequestered for the duration of the trial. Collins prolongs the trial with meaningless debate in an effort to stay in the lap of luxury. In the process he irritates his fellow jurors and inadvertently makes a break in the case. The movie features a host of courtroom antics performed by Shore and his cohorts. This movie was based on the teleplay, Twelve Angry Men, which itself was adapted into film in 1957 starring Henry Fonda.
