The film is set in 1911 at a Roman Catholic parish in the rural town of Solon, Michigan. Sister Rita , a young nun, arrives at the parish to help run the church school. When the parishâ€™s two elderly nuns contract tuberculosis, Sister Rita is forced to move into the rectory that is home to Father Rivard , the parish priest. The close proximity between the two begins to set off gossip and suspicions, to the point that a monsignor from the diocese  comes to give Father Rivard a talking-to. The gossip turns out to be correct, as the priest and the nun confess their love for each other. However, their declaration of emotion leads to tragedy.Spirituality and Practice review
