As film star Frankie Fane  is about to hear if he won a best acting Oscar, his friend Hymie Kelly  reminisces about Fane's struggle to the top, beginning as a spieler for his stripper girlfriend Laurel . After moving to New York, Frankie dumps Laurel for a budding fashion designer, Kay Bergdahl , which sets up a chance meeting with talent scout Sophie Cantaro . Sophie arranges for him to be signed with agent "Kappy" Kapstetter  and brings Frankie to Hollywood, where he quickly becomes a rising star. At each turn, however, Fane is an unprincipled heel, using and hurting others and causing them to recoil from him. His life into a tailspin, he unexpectedly receives an Oscar nomination, which Kappy believes is the result of Fane's portrayal of a "man without morals", therefore portraying himself. In order to ensure his victory, he secretly employs the services of a crooked private investigator , who leaks information that should influence voters to support Fane's Oscar candidacy. The moment of truth comes as presenter Merle Oberon  announces the winner. As she states the name "Frank," Fane rises instantaneously, prepared to bolt to the stage; she then immediately follows with "Sinatra." As Frank Sinatra moves towards the stage, Fane is left with a completely stunned, crestfallen look, clapping his hands robotically, while everyone in the assemblage whom he has wronged enjoys the comeuppance for this wholly self-absorbed, unfeeling individual.
