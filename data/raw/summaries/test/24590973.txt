It’s Christmas Eve and the staff of the adult video store, Amazing Video, are settling in for a long night. Not only will there be a crush of last minute shoppers, but porn star Dyanna Lauren is appearing to sign her latest release for her rabid, trench coat-wearing fans. Prudish new owner, Joe  has recently inherited over the store from his much wilder late sister. Joe has also taken over parenting duties for his precocious niece Grace  who would rather go out on the town than spend Christmas with her puritanical uncle. Helping Joe learn the ropes of porn and teenagers is anything goes-assistant Tina . When not helping her overwhelmed boss by demonstrating proper use of a strap-on, Tina needles her ex-boyfriend Adam  with tales of her sexual conquests which include family members and a curious pooch. Adam secretly hopes for a chance to talk to Grace. Wise guys Dean  and Christian  work security and pass the time ignoring their job and betting who would perform the more disgusting sex act for a rare comic book. As the night goes on, the gang is confronted by wacky customers including a dildo-craving Rastafarian, a borscht belt comedian, a K-Y jelly eating space alien, the man in black tailing him and his partner, a chicken. Dean and Christian perform the musical number: “You Can Have Sex With Anything You Want.” Everyone gets involved when a mad bomber learns that the Price is Right girls are better than Viagra. Finally, Dyanna Lauren and Moby lead the porn geeks and employees in a rousing rendition of Feliz Navidad before everyone heads to Joe’s for tofurkey.
