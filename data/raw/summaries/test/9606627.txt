This film depicts the disputes between two forms of the dance styles. One being purely Classical  and the other being rural folk . The film clearly shows the egos, hatred and ignorance faced by both the forms of music towards each other. The climax ends with a beautiful note which joins both the music genres. Hence the name Sangamam.
