Four New Jersey girls set off to New York City to see the Beatles' Ed Sullivan show: Rosie Petrofsky  is in love with Paul, and wants to meet him in person; Grace Corrigan , is certain that if she can get some exclusive photos of The Beatles, her career as a photographer will be secured; Pam Mitchell ([[Nancy Allen , is about to get married and wants to have one last night of fun before her wedding; and Janis Goldman  believes that the Beatles "undermine artistic integrity", and tags along to protest their music. They are aided by Larry Dubois  – their "chauffeur" – and tough guy Tony Smerko , who is annoyed that the Beatles are supplanting American acts on the charts and on the radio, but who tags along, just the same.
