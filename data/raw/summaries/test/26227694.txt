Slip is a copy boy for a newspaper, but dreams of having his own byline. Sach is an aspiring photographer for the same paper. The two of them come across a plot to fix sporting events and go undercover to expose the gangsters. Gabe, who is working for the gangsters, has a story of Slip's published which brings a libel suit against the paper because of lack of evidence. The lawsuit goes to trial, and at the last minute Gabe, who is feeling remorse, retrieves photographs that would back the story and gets them to Slip in time for them to be presented as evidence.
