On the planet Eternia, both the forces of good and evil struggle for the ultimate power of the universe. But for some, power is not enough. The evil Skeletor, ever plotting his conquest of Eternia turns his eye to one of the last remaining wizards of the old kingdomâ€”Malik, The Wizard of Stone Mountain. Tucked in the sleepy village of Artana at the base of the Mystic Mountains, Skeletors' ally, Evil-Lyn summons a demon, Locus, to manipulate Malik. Tampering with magic beyond his control, Malik makes a Faustian deal with Locus to help his people and win the love of his life. It is up to the heroic Masters of the Universe to save Malik from certain doom.
