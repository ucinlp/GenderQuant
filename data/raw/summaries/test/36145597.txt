On Papua, the easternmost island in Indonesia, Thomas, Mazmur, and their friends are waiting for a teacher, who should arrive through the small airstrip in their village; the airstrip is their only contact with the outside world. They have been without a teacher for six months. They have studied on their own from nature and their elders, such as the priest Samuel , doctor Fatimah, and the elders Ucok and Jolex, but it is not enough. However, Mazmur's father is killed by the father of their friend Agnes. This news drives Mazmur's uncle, Michael, and his wife Vina  to come to the village from their home in Jakarta. They arrive in the village as tensions continue to build. Michael tries to ease tensions between the two factions, but is unsuccessful; his other brother, Alex, despises Michael's modern way of life and insists that the killers must pay an eye for an eye. While open violence breaks out among the adults, the children&nbsp;– despite being from different factions&nbsp;– continue to play together and learn with Vina.
