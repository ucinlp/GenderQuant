Terry Taylor  is a senior at conservative Wyndham College for Women and, under an assumed name, a successful pop songwriter. After her publisher Gary Underwood  unknowingly exposes her career, Wyndham's board of trustees&mdash;including the college founder's grandson, California State Senator Hubert Morrison &mdash;condemns Terry for indecent behavior. To distract herself from a possible expulsion, Terry, her friends Sue Ann Mobley  and Lynne , and their physical-education instructor Marge Endicott  travel to Sun Valley, Idaho for a Christmas-break ski vacation. There they meet Gary and his artist friend Armand ; Senator Morrison, who wants to solicit the youth vote; and Lynne's husband. The Dave Clark Five, The Animals, and other musical acts perform in the background as Gary and Armand romance Terry and Sue Ann, respectively, while Lynne and her husband spend the entire vacation in their room. Senator Morrison courts Marge and shows that he is a talented dancer, but an embarrassing newspaper photograph threatens his reelection. The others demonstrate his support among the young by holding a successful telephone poll with musical performances.
