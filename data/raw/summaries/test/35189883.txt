After his mother Nancy Lincoln , falls victim to an illness that requires her to be tied to her bed, vicious and cannibalistic, 10-year-old Abe Lincoln  sees his father Thomas Lincoln  commit suicide at her bedside. Taking up a weapon, the distraught young Abe tells his mother that he loves her before beheading her. He then joins others in his community in containing a local zombie outbreak. When an adult Abraham Lincoln  has become President of a fracturing United States, he is apprised of rumors concerning a prominent Confederate stronghold. He is told that a regiment of 30 men had gone to Confederate Fort Pulaski to seize it from the Confederates and only one man returned barely alive. When questioning the survivor, Lincoln discovers the soldier has an illness that seems to bring corpses back to life. He then personally leads a team of the newly established secret service of 12 men to accompany him in investigating the fort. They get to the fort and are attacked by Confederate survivors led by General Stonewall Jackson  as well as by several of the infected people. Abe kills one of his men who had been bitten by a zombie and explains to the others in his party that if they are bitten or scratched by a zombie, or if zombie's blood makes contact with their mouths or eyes, that they too will become infected and, within twenty-four hours, would no longer be considered "human". In the meantime, while downtown, Pike  and John Wilkinson  are investigating an office of some sort and without warning two zombies  and  eat Pike, causing John Wilkinson to escape. When John Wilkinson reunites with Abe and the rest of the men, Abe encounters an old lover turned prostitute Mary Owens  who is hiding a young Theodore Roosevelt , Mary's daughter Sophia , and their friend Annika  to protect them from the invasion. The group makes their way back to the fort where after a dangerous attack from the zombies, Annika is bitten by a zombie and Abe shoots her in the head much to his deepest regret. When they all reach the interior of the fort, all feel the heartache and loss of their friends taking its toll. Abe then goes to Jackson, seeking help in killing the zombies. Jackson refuses to kill the zombies, believing them to only be sick and in need of care. He claims Lincoln's actions are only against the members of the confederacy. When escaping to the fort, Mary is splashed in the face with zombie blood and soon falls ill. Meanwhile, agent John Wilkinson plots to kill Lincoln while he's alone. He recants when he catches Abe praying, as in his mind prayer would ensure Lincoln's soul going to heaven, and remains behind as the rest of the group heads into the township to kill off the zombies. Being greatly outnumbered, only Abe, Theodore, and Sophia return when the other agents are slaughtered. In the meantime, Agent Hawthorne  and Agent Chamberlin  are surrounded by zombies, causing them to run to the attic stairs while being pursued by zombies. Chamberlin gets bitten while Hawthorne escapes, after Hawthorne pulls the ladder up in order to keep himself and the others safe. Hawthorne falls from the roof of the building breaking only his ankle. After realizing there's no hope, he commits suicide by shooting himself in the mouth, causing the zombies to eat him. After finally realizing that Lincoln is right and escape is unlikely, Stonewall shows Abe a cache of gunpowder. They then decide to use the explosive to blow up the fort after trapping and containing the zombies inside. When the fuse goes out, Stonewall ventures down alone to re-light it, but is overrun and killed by the zombies just after doing so. Abe and Brown escape just in time and the entire place goes up. Mary accepts her fate and goes off with Lincoln to die, much to Sophia's heartbreak. Eighteen months later, Abe goes to visit Mary who had been in the care of a doctor investigating the illness in vain hope of finding a cure. As Abe cleans wounds caused by her restraining shackles, Mary grabs his hand scratches his skin infecting him, much to his horror. Knowing he is himself uncurable, Abe requests that a message be sent to John Wilkinson, as earlier he'd discovered that Wilkinson was actually John Wilkes Booth who had a plot to kidnap Lincoln in response to the end of the war and the Union the victor. The message gives Booth the information to know exactly where Lincoln would be the following night as Abe and his wife Mary go to the theater, thus leading to his assassination at Booth's hands.
