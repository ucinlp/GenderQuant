Rod Steiger stars as Christopher Gill, a serial killer who is fixated on his late mother, who had been an actress. Gill preys on older women who remind him of her. A Broadway theater director and costumer, he adopts various disguises, e.g. priest, policeman, plumber, hairdresser, etc., to put his victims at ease  before strangling them and painting a pair of lips on their foreheads with garish red lipstick. Gill strikes up an adversarial relationship, via telephone, with Detective Morris Brummel , who is investigating the murders. As Brummel realizes that the killer has access to costumes, he seeks out local costume outlets, and tracks down Gill. Once he sees a portrait of Gill's mother with bright red lipstick in the theater, he knows he has his man. A B-plot concerns Brummel's own mother , who wants her son to be more like his brother . Brummel's love interest in the film, Kate Palmer , manages to win over Brummel's mother, but is later targeted herself by Gill--for reasons other than his mother fixation as Palmer does not fit the profile of his previous victims.
