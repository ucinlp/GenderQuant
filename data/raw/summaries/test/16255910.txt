Anthea  is undergoing a crisis of confidence: overworked, no boyfriend, and now all her friends are leaving Brisbane. She is tempted to leave herself, but is opposed by her longtime best platonic male friend Michael . Michael thinks people who leave Brisbane are copycats who follow the crowd; he is quite happy to stay in Brisbane, he is in a stable job and a stable very low-maintenance 'sex-with-the-ex' relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Stephanie . In short, he is in a rut. Anthea’s temptation to leave Brisbane increases with the impending departure of her flatmate Kath . However, she then hears that her ex-boyfriend Jake  is coming back to Brisbane to live. To Michael’s annoyance, she dreams of a great future with him. Michael is then thrown out of his comfort zone by starting a new relationship with a girl he meets at work; Simone . Slightly "alternative" and good natured, Simone is totally different from the sorts of girls he normally deals with, and he finds himself in a relationship over which he does not have total control. On her last day in Australia, Anthea and Michael finally resolve their feelings for each other.
