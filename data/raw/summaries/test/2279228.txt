She reveals this secret only to her elder sister Aarti . The secret is her love for a budding musician Raja . Raja is not a rich man, but that does not deter Anjali from loving him. Aarti assures Anjali and Raja that she will convince her parents of their true love. But unfortunately fate has different plans for them. Aarti passes away on the birth of her twin babies. Circumstances force Anjali to marry Aarti's husband, Aditya Sahai . With the much older and mature Aditya, Anjali migrates to New Delhi. Aditya is a business tycoon who hardly finds any time for his sister-in-law turned wife or his two lovable daughters. Anjali fulfills every role asked for her by society but cannot bridge the gap between herself and Aditya. She finds herself in a marriage that has no compatibility but only compromise. Her only source of solace are her two endearing girls. Amidst all this, one day Raja, who is now a famous fusion singer, walks back into her life. Suddenly Anjali is torn. She begins hanging out with Raja. When Aditya returns, he senses a change in her and decides to look into it. He seeks the help of his friends, a flamboyant couple &mdash; Dil and Pallavi Arora . After revealing to Anjali that he did know about Raja and acknowledging that Anjali is not at fault, Aditya gives her the freedom to choose between Raja and himself. She chooses Aditya over Raja, not only because of her duty as a mother, but also because she realises that she loves Aditya. Raja leaves and Anjali embarks on a tour with her husband.
