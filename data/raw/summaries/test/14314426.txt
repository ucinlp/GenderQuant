Samantha Jackson, a television videotape editor, was last seen in August 2003 and is officially classified as a missing person. Whilst sifting through Sam's flat several weeks after her disappearance, one of her friends, Abi Wright, discovers part of a video diary that Sam was making only a few weeks before her disappearance. The diary was a record of Sam's experiences phone dating, and was designed to be shown as Reality TV. Soon afterwards, the TV producer working with Sam, Kerry Finch, returns from a foreign assignment and tries to contact her - finding Abi instead. Kerry Finch has more tapes, which end dramatically after an apparent sudden downturn in Sam Jackson's fortunes. The search, conducted with the police and the National Missing Persons Helpline and followed by the documentary crew, finds more clues which hint at a darker side to Sam's character. However, just when the trail seems to be going cold, a dramatic breakthrough occurs.
