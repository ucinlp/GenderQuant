The title page of this film shows the shadow of a cross, with "No war is holy" written across the transept. Constantineâ€™s Sword is the story of James P. Carroll's journey to uncover the roots of war. Carroll, a former Catholic priest whose father  was a famous Air Force general, implies that there has been a relationship between religiously inspired violence and war, beginning with the adoption of Christianity by the Roman Emperor Constantine I in 312 AD. Constantine was convinced that he had won a battle because he had followed the instructions of a vision, to inscribe a sign of the cross  on the shields of his soldiers. In Carroll's view, this event marked the beginning of an unholy alliance between the military and the Church. Carroll focuses on Catholic and evangelical anti-Judaism, and invokes the cross as a symbol of the long history of Christian xenophobic violence against Jews and non-Christians,Constantine's Sword, HollywoodJesus.comChris Barsanti.
