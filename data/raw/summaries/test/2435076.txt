SoundtrackPete Best's helpEuropean version A European version exists, and is a different cut from the American version. The following changes were made to the European version: #Some of the dialogue and text in this version is different. #The opening narration is now done by a British narrator, with the opening text superimposed on a black screen as opposed to a blue screen. #The prologue, which includes John saying that he wants to see Mickey Mouse is omitted. #The opening theme song is "My Bonnie" instead of "She Loves You". #A scene in an art school with a naked woman is included. #The scenes where The Beatles perform at Der Kaiserkeller are longer. They also include two additional song scenes: "Kansas City" and "Shake, Rattle and Roll" . #The scene where they find Stuart badly beaten has extra dialogue. It also fleshes out Stuart's refusal to see a doctor even more, unlike the regular versions where it abruptly cuts right after John says "Let's get him to a hospital", making the viewer think that Stuart went to a hospital after he got badly beaten, when it is clear that he did not. #The scene where Stuart and Astrid have their moment in bed together is different. The other version has him showing her her new necklace, while this version, has the two of them making love to each other. #John's bedroom scene with Stuart has extra shots of the others in bed. #The scene where they first talk to Brian Epstein is a little bit longer. #The scene where Brian goes to find The Beatles performing "Love me Do" at a venue is longer. #The scene where Brian goes to tell the Beatles about George Martin and EMI, has him getting out of a taxi. #In the scene where Cynthia tell John about expecting a baby, John asks her "What are we gonna call him?" #The scene where the Beatles arrive at New York City is longer. #The end credits feature "She Loves You", instead of "My Bonnie".
