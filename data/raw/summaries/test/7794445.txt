Eighteen years after seeing their mother overdose in a seedy Hollywood motel room, a pair of permanently warped siblings attempts to fulfill their mother's dying wish that they both become world class ventriloquists. The son hasn't said a word since the day he watched his mother die, and daughter is determined to make it to Las Vegas by whatever means possible. They both come from a long line of talented ventriloquists, but these days the balance of power has shifted in the dummy's favor. Now, as these twisted siblings embark on a murderous desert rampage, it's plain to see who's really in control here.
