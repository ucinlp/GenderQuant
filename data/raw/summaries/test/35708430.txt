Roy is a handsome black Surinam man who studies in the Netherlands. He is recalled by telegram to Suriname because his mother is dying. His Dutch girlfriend Karina  lends him money for a plane ticket. Back in his homeland, Roy soon becomes obsessed with his own country and its culture. When he falls for the Hindu nurse Rubia, the conservative Hindu and Black communities are in revolt. Roy will not return to the Netherlands to finish his studies, even if Karina comes to pick him up. His duty is in Suriname, he says.
