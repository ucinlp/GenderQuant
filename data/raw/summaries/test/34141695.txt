Seoul, the present day. Out of the blue, architect Lee Seung-min  is approached by Yang Seo-yeon , whom he knew at college some 17 years ago, to design a new house for her on the site of her 30-year-old family home on Jeju island. Seung-min reluctantly agrees but can't come up with a design that pleases her. In the end, they decide to renovate and expand the existing house, and he and Seo-yeon spend a considerable amount of time together down in Jeju, to the growing annoyance of his fiancee Eun-chae , with whom he is soon to be married and move to the US. As Seo-yeon cares for her dying father  and Seung-min learns more about what became of Seo-yeon in the intervening years, he recalls their initial meeting at college in the early 1990s. Seung-min and Seo-yeon  had lived in the same neighborhood and attended the same architecture class. He remembers her liking for rich student Jae-wook , his inability to declare his attraction to her, and the times being coached by his best friend, Nab-ddeuk , in how to get girls. Hoping to confess his feelings to her at the perfect timing, Seung-min asks Seo-yeon to meet him at the abandoned house they frequent, on the first day that it snows that coming winter. But one night he catches Jae-wook and a drunk Seo-yeon entering her house together. Fearing the worst, he ends his friendship with Seo-yeon due to his pain of believing she had chosen Jae-wook. The first day of snow arrives, and Seo-yeon is left waiting in the abandoned house alone. Heartbroken, she leaves behind her CD player with a CD of her favorite artist at the house. Seo-yeon in the present day receives that very same CD player and CD from Seung-min, meaning that he actually went to the house later and remembered their promise. But despite the bittersweetness of their first love, in the end, Seung-min still chooses his fiancee Eun-chae and flew with her to America, while Seo-yeon sits in the house he built for her, listening to the CD.Architecture 101.
