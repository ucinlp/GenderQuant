After the end of World War II, Peter Kuban , a Hungarian displaced person and survivor of the Nazi concentration camps, stows away on a ship bound for New York City. However, he is spotted and held for the authorities. When they arrive, he claims that he qualifies for entry under an exception for those who helped Allied soldiers during the war, but all he knows about the paratrooper he hid from the enemy is that his name is Tom and he is a musician from New York City. The authorities decide that this is not enough and that he must be sent back to Europe. He jumps off the ship, breaking some ribs, and starts searching for Tom. He encounters an unemployed ex-factory worker named Maggie Summers . When she steals a coat in a restaurant, Tom helps her keep away from the police. They go to her apartment, where she tends his injury as best she can and learns his story. When Mrs. Hinckley, her landlady, threatens to evict her for being behind on her rent, Peter gives her all the money he has. Later, however, Eddie, the landlord's son, barges in and tries to become amorous with Maggie. Peter bursts out of hiding and starts fighting him, but gets the worst of it. Maggie knocks Eddie out with a chair, and the pair flee into the night. The police are notified. Meanwhile, Tom sees Peter's picture on the front page of a newspaper. He wants to go to the immigration department, but his girlfriend Nancy persuades him to go to an important audition she has arranged instead. Though he impresses band leader Jack Teagarden, Tom leaves abruptly to try to help Peter. The fugitives are recognized in the subway. The police grab Maggie, but Peter gets away. She meets up with Tom. After hearing Tom's story, Inspector Bailey believes that Peter can stay, but only if they can reach him before 7 am. At that time, the ship will depart and, by law, Peter must be jailed and deported. The trio drive around searching. Peter slips into an unoccupied taxi and falls asleep. When burlesque dancer Tanya gets into the taxi after work, she recognizes Peter from the newspaper photo. However, she takes him home to her apartment for rest and a meal. When he asks why, she explains that her real name is Bella Zakoyla, and that she is a fellow "Hunky". Her immigrant mother approves, but her brother Freddie does not want to risk getting into trouble, saying that it is the responsibility of the United Nations. The loud argument rouses Peter, sleeping in the other room, and he slips away. Acting on Freddie's remark, Peter heads toward the United Nations building. He is seen. The police, Maggie, Tom and Bailey drive there. Peter panics and flees to the roof, where he contemplates jumping. However, Maggie and Tom get to him in time to reassure him that he is now safe.
