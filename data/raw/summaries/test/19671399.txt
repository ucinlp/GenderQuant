Set in the future, youth gang violence is so high that the areas around some schools have become "free fire zones", into which not even the Police will venture. When Dr. Miles Langford , the Principal of Kennedy High School, decides to take his school back from the gangs, robotics specialist Dr. Robert Forrest  provides "tactical education units". These humanoids have been programmed to teach and are supplied with weapons to discipline trouble-makers. The androids soon overstep their authority, causing the students to fight back.
