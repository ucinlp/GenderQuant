Here too, a man loses his sister and his mother to the villains.But instead of going after the villains to extract revenge, he goes after all bad guys. He turns into a self-styled vigilante, ridding the streets of rowdies and goondas. Vijay is a Tamil professor living with his widowed mother and his sister. He is in love with Uma ([[Ambika , a lawyer. During a visit to his friend Ravi's  house, he is disgusted by goings-on in his neighborhood. Illicit liquor is being sold at a tea-stall while prostitution is flourishing in another house in the same colony. But his complaints to the police, yield nothing since the policeman is on the villains' payroll and manages to warn them before making a raid. When Ravi's sister is raped and killed and the perpetrator Mohanraj  gets off scot-freewith help from a minister, Vijay and Ravi take matters into their own hands and clean up the tea-stall and brothel on their own. Wanting to teach Vijay a lesson, Mohanraj and his goondas rape his sister  and kill his mother. Vijay then turns into a vigilante, walking the streets at nights and dealing out his own brand of justice - shoot first and ask questions later - to the rowdies and goondas. He soon becomes known as Robinhood, helper of the poor and the police sends Singaaram  to unmask Robinhood.
