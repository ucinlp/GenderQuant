In Miami, three lifelong friends, months away from high school graduation indulge in reckless behavior that finds them on the brink of either their graduation or their mortality. These three friends are from very different backgrounds. Mikey Acosta is a star high school baseball prospect, while Angel is a whiz of a student as well as the son of a prominent Miami politician. Stok is the son of an incarcerated drug lord. These three best friends attempt to navigate through their senior year amongst the pressures and temptations of the city.
