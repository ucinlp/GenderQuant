After fifteen-year-old Nik's  favorite uncle passes away, she feels like the world is about to collapse and considers suicide. In addition to dealing with typical problems such as school, bullies, wearing braces, body changes, incest, and babysitting, she overhears a portion of a conversation between her parents, causing her to believe that her father is having an affair with her recently-widowed aunt, which considerably adds to her stress. She fears that her parents are going to divorce on her sixteenth birthday. The only factor that is helping to give her balance is a limerance she harbors for pro wrestler Bret Hart. With help from her unconventional friends, Mouse and Babyface, she attempts to save her parents' marriage, as well as deal with a horrible rash.
