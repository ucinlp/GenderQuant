The film is set in 1890s Paris. Henri Danglard is the owner of a cafe, which features his mistress, Lola, as a belly dancer. Losing money, Henri finds himself in Montmartre and seeing a pretty girl  at a dance hall there, has an idea: to revive an out of fashion dance, the cancan. He sells his theater to pay for debts and, receiving backing from a patron, essentially in exchange for Lola, purchases a property that will become the Moulin Rouge. Meanwhile, he hires Nini away from her mother and her mother's laundry business.
