{{POV-section}} 96 MINUTES is the story of a carjacking and the four kids caught in the chaos of one night. The story builds to a climax as it intercuts between the car and the beginning of that day, following the separate stories of each kid - where they come from, who they are and how they all ended up in one car on that fateful night. With performances by a young multicultural cast, this tale touches on issues of race, class, friendship and the connections to the past.
