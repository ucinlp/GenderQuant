The film follows several inhabitants of the Italian town during the end of World War II. Defeat is certain for the Germans, and the front is retreating back to Germany, leaving a path of destruction in their wake. The Germans plan to bomb several buildings in the town, and have told all the villagers to congregate in the town's church. Approximately half of the town decides to stay, and place their trust in the church. The rest of the town dresses in dark clothing, and go out to seek the Americans, who are rumored to be nearby, liberating towns as they come to them.
