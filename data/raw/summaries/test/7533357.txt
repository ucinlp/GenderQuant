Annabel Andrews  and her mother, Ellen Andrews (Barbara Harris  constantly quarrel. Following a disagreement on Friday the 13th, Annabel leaves to join a friend at a local diner. In sync, Annabel and her mother  both wish aloud, "I wish I could switch places with her for just one day." The mother and daughter's wish comes true when they switch bodies and, subsequently, lives. Annabel and Ellen continue to live their everyday lives as each other. Annabel remains at home, tending to laundry, car repair, grocery deliveries, carpet cleaners, dry cleaners, her housemaid, and the family Basset Hound. As though Annabel did not have her hands full, Mr. Andrews coerces her to cook dinner for twenty-five as his catered dinner party plans fell through. Annabel enlists the neighbor boy to assist her, but manages to destroy every course in the making. Ellen attends school as Annabel where she struggles with marching band, destroys her entire typing class's electric typewriters, exposes her photography class's developing film, and leads the school's field hockey team to a loss. In an effort to escape school, Ellen  runs to her husband's office. There, she encounters Bill Andrew's  new attractive, young, and immodestly dressed secretary. Ellen attempts to intimidate the young woman by sharing how frightening "her mother" is. This effort appeared successful as the secretary adopts more modest clothing, glasses, and an unflattering hairstyle. Ellen  asks Mr. Andrews for access to his credit card in order to make herself over as her braces were scheduled to be removed that afternoon. As the day ends in a comical twist, the mother-daughter pair wish a new request: To return to themselves. With a new understanding of each other's lives, they forgive each other. Following the events of Freaky Friday, Father Bill and son Ben discuss how fun a Saturday in each other's place would be. As they wish to switch places, Ellen nervously throws her cards into the air.
