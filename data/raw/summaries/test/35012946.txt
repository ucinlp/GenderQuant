Tango Ya Ba Wendo is the name given to the 40's and 50’s in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, a time when Antoine Kolosoyi, called Wendo, the pioneer of Zairian rumba, triumphed. In 1992, Wendo is almost 70 years old. The old singer and adventurer tells of his life, his mother as a traditional singer, his first job – as a mechanic, his beginning in songs during colonial times, followed by success and then oblivion... And he still keeps on singing.
