Jonas is soon comfortably assuming Rocky’s identity. Initially he believes that Mara is just delusional, but when Warren, Mara’s old friend and neighbor, arrives for a visit, surprisingly Warren also acts as if Jonas were Rocky. As Billie, his alleged sister, comes home, Jonas thinks that the game is over and that he will be finally unmasked as an impostor, but even Billie recognizes him as her brother.
