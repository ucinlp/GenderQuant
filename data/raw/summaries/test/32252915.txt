Jayaraman  is popularly known as Kunjaliyan  in Gopalapuram, a village in the Keralaâ€“Tamil Nadu border. He is the younger brother of three sisters. The sisters were caring him as their own child since the death of his father and mother. Jayaraman was the pet of his sisters and he was not interested in to do any job. He is lazy. Everything was perfect until the sisters got married. The brothers in law were not interested in Jayaraman at all and they were not considered him as their younger brother. One day he left Gopalapuram to become a millionaire. Somehow he reached Dubai after years and he managed to get a job there. Unfortunately he got terminated from his job due to the due global recession. He is forced to go back to Gopalapuram and he is not interested in returning to his village without being a millionaire. Now Jayaraman is returning to his village considering the advice of Mr. Preman, his best friend in Dubai. But Jayaraman is shocked to see the warm welcome by his family members at the airport. Everyone is trying to take their young brother-in-law to their home. Why are they showing this much interest in him now than before? That question is what remains to be.
