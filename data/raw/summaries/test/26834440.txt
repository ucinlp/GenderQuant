The film opens with a young girl  running through a graveyard, crying, her face covered with skull paint. She makes it to her house and her parents ask her what's wrong. The little girl, named Sandy, responds by stating, "I don't remember." Years later, Sandy Channing  and her brother, Eli , are both academic students with scholarships to Stanford University. They go to a party at night at their friend T.J.'s house, and they and their friends go to the graveyard to play a game. As they are about to start, a girl about their age  asks to play. They allow her, and they play a different version of tag, where one of them is a ghost, and whoever the ghost tags becomes a ghost until there is one left. Eli, who is the ghost, and the others tag everyone, leaving the unnamed girl the winner. As Sandy tells her that she's won, the girl asks if she remembers her. Sandy tells her she doesn't, with the girl stating, "You will," before jumping from the cliff behind her. The police arrive but are unable to find a body. The group then decides to call it a night and go home. The next day, Layla  and Chad  are on the side of the road after having sex in Chad's car, with Chad telling Layla he wants to break up. Furious, Layla throws his class ring, which was hanging on her necklace, into the lake. With Chad driving off and leaving her alone at the lake, Layla goes into the water to retrieve the necklace when she sees a girl seemingly drown. When Layla swims to the buoy to look for the girl, it's as if the girl was never there and she swims back toward the shore. However, before she can get out of the water, she sees the girl floating lifelessly in front of her. Leaning down to see if the girl is okay, Layla is pulled into the water and drowned by the girl, who is revealed to be a demon-like incarnation of the unnamed girl who had disappeared the night before. Meanwhile, Chad arrives at Sandy and Eli's house with a different girl in tow, candy striper Cecilia . Looking on in disgust, Sandy asks what would Layla think, with Chad replying, "Who?" Before anything else happens, Chad leaves to take Cecilia back to the hospital. As the rest of the group is waiting for T.J.  to get off of work, T.J. is negotiating a deal to buy an engagement ring for his girlfriend, Lex . After bartering his paycheck for the ring, T.J. is asked to check the safety on machines one, two, and three before going home. As he is alone, he opts to smoke a little pot before doing so. After checking the safety on the first two machines, T.J. believes he sees someone at the other end of the warehouse before deducting it was an hallucination, stating, "Note to self: drugs are bad." However, he is soon scared by the sight of the demonic Layla and gets his caught in the machine , before having his head pushed into the machine by the unnamed demonic girl. Just after this, Jake  remembers he forgot to get beer for their trip, to which Sandy replies that T.J. was supposed to be bringing it. However, just like Layla, the rest of the group has no memory of T.J. and Sandy decides to call him, only to find his contact information erased from her cellphone. Just then, Jake and Lex's dad, Sheriff Mitchell , pulls up in his patrol car to drop off Lex. Opting to go on with their spring break trip to the beach, the group stops at a convenience, with Lex distracting the cashier by having sex with him in the backroom while the rest of the friends steal liquor and food. Frustrated with Lex's seemingly promiscuous behavior despite dating T.J., Sandy walks off while Eli and Hannah  look on. Going after Sandy, Jake asks who T.J. is and calls Chad to check to make sure he is on his way. After hanging up, however, Chad is killed when the ghosts scare him into flipping his car, with the unnamed girl making it explode. Leaving the store, the group gets into Eli's Jeep with Sandy asking Jake where his bike went, to which responds that he had left it at her house. Once on the road, Sandy becomes even more confused when her stuff and the beach gear are gone, but her friends look at her confusingly, asking why they would be taking a boogie board to the mountains for spring break. Just then, Sandy yells at Eli to pull the car over, with Sandy getting out to look at Chad's car, battered and dirty in a junkyard. However, for some strange reason, no one but Sandy remembers who Chad is, and they soon drive to T.J.'s house, which appears vacant and in ruin, the apparent scene of some unknown crime of some sort, as there is caution tape around the house and yard. As Sandy goes into the house with her boyfriend Jake and her brother Eli, the other girls, Lex and Hannah, get into an argument in the car. At the same time, Sandy begins to remember the unnamed girl from the graveyard as her friend when she was little, but nothing more. Later, Lex is killed by what appears to be undead versions of her murdered friends, with Sandy witnessing her demise. The other three think Sandy is losing her mind, as none of the others remember Lex anymore. Sandy and the others go to the police station, where they learn the mysterious girl's name is Angela Smith and she lives in a convent. Sandy begs her friends to go with her, and they agree, but also agree to wait until morning. At a local hotel, Sandy sleeps due to a sleeping pill in her drink while Hannah and Eli go to the pool and have sex. Eli goes back up to the room to find Jake trying to contain Sandy who is throwing herself around in the room. Hannah is killed, and Sandy and Jake are now alone in the hotel room. Eli calls Sandy and tells her he can no longer cover for her. She then tells him to meet her at the convent. She and Jake then discover Angela is in a coma. At the convent, Jake is killed. Eli, who doesn't remember Jake, picks up a shaken Sandy. Sandy cries over her dead boyfriend, and Eli begins to realize that they are being erased in time, just like the rhyme they sang before playing the game in the graveyard. After heading home, Sandy, whose parents believe she has become depressed and suicidal, is sedated and taken to the hospital. While there, Eli is attacked and killed by the undead versions of his murdered friends. As Sandy is sedated again once at the hospital, she asks for Eli, of whom her parents have no recollection at all. Asking if Eli is a friend of hers, Sandy's parents tells the doctor that she has no friends. Later, Sandy dreams of a time where she and her friends played a scary prank on Angela , who had a seizure in front of the convent after knocking her head into the door. It is soon revealed that the little girl at the beginning of the film is a young Sandy, and the girl who mysteriously vanished and who has been committing the murders is, in fact, Angela. Sandy awakes and, recalling the rhyme to "kill the ghost or seal your fate," goes to Angela's room and switches off her life support. Leaving the room, she hears beats from Angela's cardiac monitor and returns to the room, only to find Angela sitting up in her bed. Sandy is then chased up to the roof by the ghosts of her friends, and encounters the young version of Angela. Despite a failed attempt to reason with her, Sandy falls from the roof of the hospital. The film ends with Angela "miraculously" awaking from her coma, while Sandy is revealed to have taken her place in a coma of her own. The mystery about Eli & the friends is not revealed whether they were imaginary people or real.
