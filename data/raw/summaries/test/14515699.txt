Porky Pig is the supervisor of the "Flockheed Eggcraft Factory", where dozens of hens lay eggs for the war effort (in this case, World War II to the tune of [[Powerhouse . The hens suddenly get distracted from their egg laying when a handsome rooster named Frankie  is heard singing outside. Frankie's renditions of "It Can't Be Wrong" by Dick Haymes and "As Time Goes By" (from [[Casablanca  causes all the hens to swoon. Porky rushes to investigate. Soon, he's auditioning for a new crooner; those showing up are caricatures of Nelson Eddy , Al Jolson , Jimmy Durante ("[[Lullaby of Broadway , Cab Calloway , and Bing Crosby  Porky asks the Bing Crosby rooster  to be the crooner, provoking a competition with Frankie. Between the two of them, the overexcited hens' egg production is increased to a level beyond what Porky can handle, including a just-hatched hen chick laying an egg many times her own size. Surveying literal hills and mountains of eggs all over his farm, an impressed Porky asks the two roosters, "How did you ever m-m-make 'em lay all those eggs." The roosters demonstrate their technique by crooning at Porky, who lays a mountainful of eggs himself as a result.
