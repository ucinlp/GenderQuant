The story unfolds in its original late 19th century tsarist Russia high-society setting and powerfully explores the capacity for love that surges through the human heart, from the passion between adulterers to the bond between a mother and her children. As Anna Karenina  questions her happiness, change comes to her family, friends, and community.
