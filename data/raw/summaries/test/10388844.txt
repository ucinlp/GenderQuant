The movie focuses on the three main characters - Tan Chun Huang ([[Mark Lee , an illegal bookie and "super gambler" who leaves the running of his family's bak kut teh stall to his younger sister, Hui Min ; Lee Yong Shun ([[Christopher Lee , an ambitious but unlucky man who abhors gambling; and Richard , a white-collar executive who is indecisive and easily influenced, but does not listen to his wife's  pleas not to gamble. Huang is first introduced into the movie, with two of his fellow bookie friends drinking at a coffeeshop. He then shares his thoughts about the gambling issues in Singapore, in which his sister then enters trying to lecture him, which he refuses to heed her advice. Shun and Richard are then introduced in a phone call Huang makes to Richard, where it is shown Shun goes beyond the speed limit and is caught. They later rush to work, late for a meeting. The latter in which results in a disgraced Richard unwanted of his proposal and Shun fired from his job. While clearing his desk, Shun, together with Richard are approached by their colleagues. A woman named Coffee-Lady wishes to ask for digits, which exasperates Shun who tries to tell her about her addiction. While Shun leaves, the colleagues and Richard talk about benefactors as a way to pick numbers, which ridicules the way how even the worse people can be a benefactor to one. The discussion goes on later back in the coffeeshop with the three friends just as they offer prayings. Before Shun meets back with his friends, he is caught beating a red light, and throws a rock at the red light camera. Unknown to him, a van also beats the red light and catches him attempting to destroy the camera. The three friends return to the stall, with Hui Min wishing to lend an encyclopaedia to her brother which enrages him, making her think that it will ruin his luck to win in his gambles. A fake monk shows up near the bak kut teh stall and recommends the 4D number 3791, but Huang, who is skeptical of fake monks, refuses to buy the number, especially after the feud with his sister. A fellow stallholder  buys the number just then. When the number comes out, Huang lashes out at Hui Min, blaming her that the number came out and he she had supposedly ruined his luck. Shun has trouble paying the instalments for his condominium, and his girlfriend Evita compounds his financial woes by demanding he buy her expensive gifts. Huang suggests Shun rent out a room in the condominium to two of Huang's friends, who moved from China to Singapore. Although this causes a furious Evita to dump Shun, he is touched by the gesture, and suggests Huang and Richard start a business with him. They welcome the idea, and take a bank loan to fund the business. Things go well with the business as they prepare everything for a stall and even a grand opening ceremony. Everything goes fine at the opening ceremony until the official opening where the trio cut the red ribbon. Unfortunately, at the opening ceremony of their business, Shun is arrested and sentenced to jail for breaking the red light camera and housing Huang's friends, who turn out to be illegal immigrants. Consequently, the hired lion dance troupe had illegal immigrants as well, which causes a big scuffle. A fight with the police and a fellow lion dance troupe artiste results in the shop blown. The situation results in the business goes bankrupt, landing Huang, Shun and Richard heavily in debt. Worst, Richard's company goes bust, and he witnesses a neighbour's home, once rich from a first place stike in lottery now vandalised by loan sharks. Richard now worries of the bank doing the same. Richard and Huang visit a remote Chinese Fortune God shrine in the wilderness, which Huang manages to ask for good numbers, turning out to be the numbers 7272. Somehow, others also get the number. Thus, Huang and Richard try to clear their debts by borrowing from a loan shark, but the police ambush them at the coffeeshop. While Huang hides in a public toilet, he refuses to comply with a policeman and beats him up, but he is later succumbed to. Huang is arrested and sentenced to jail for illegal bookmaking and causing hurt to a public servant, but he was temporarily bailed out to settle family matters. Richard is now left alone. Coincidentally, Huang, Shun and the fake monk are incarcerated in the same cell. The fake monk recommends the number 7272, exactly the same number Huang had received in the wilderness. As the fake monk had previously recommended the number 3791, which came out, Huang and Shun are determined to buy the number. After a discussion with Richard, who also wishes to buy the number, they agree that Richard will place a joint bet, paying S$100 for each person. When the number comes out, Richard's wife tempts him to keep all the winnings, because Huang and Shun had not paid for their bets. That night, Richard and his wife dreamt that they kept all the winnings to themselves, but had difficulty keeping the money safely and preventing others from knowing that they had won 4D, and that Huang and Shun took revenge on them after coming out of prison. Eventually, they decide not to keep the winnings to themselves. They decide to invest their winnings in a bak kut teh business based on an innovative business model by Huang after his release, which prospers. The trio handle their business well, setting up many branches islandwide. Shun makes up with Hui Min, and everyone becomes happy.
