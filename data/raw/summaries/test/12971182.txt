Lili, a 19 year old, returns from holidays and learns that her twin brother Loïc has left the house after a violent argument with their father. Lili had a very strong relationship with her brother and is distraught after having no contact with him at all, concluding that something happened to him. Lili stops eating and begins losing strength and ends up in the hospital where she has decided to stop living at all. She receives a letter from Loïc where he apologizes for leaving without a word or getting back to her and makes it very clear that he will not be coming back. He also says that he has been traveling around living on petty jobs and blames their father for his lot in life. Lili recovers and begins looking for her twin by following the trail of the letters she has received along with Thomas, the boyfriend of her friend from school, Lea. Lili and Thomas gradually fall in love. When Lili goes to Saint Aubin with Thomas, she sees her father mailing letters, concluding that her father was imitating Loïc's handwriting and sending letters to Lili, in an attempt to protect her and keep her alive. Coincidentally, Thomas, when visitng his grandmother's grave, sees Loïc's gravestone. When Thomas arrives at Lili's house for a family lunch, he speaks with her parents, mentioning that he knows of Loïc's death. They reveal that Loïc had died in an accident during mountain climbing, and they plead for Thomas not to tell Lili anything. Thomas believes that they are crazy, but decides to keep the truth to himself. Lili, who arrives home shortly after to meet Thomas and her parents for the lunch, finds her brother's guitar hidden in her father's car. Knowing he would never have left behind his beloved guitar, she learns that he can not just have gone away. Even though both Lili and Thomas know the truth by now, they don't talk about it, even though Loïc has been the most important thing on their minds for the past year. They talk about leaving the city and go to the sea.
