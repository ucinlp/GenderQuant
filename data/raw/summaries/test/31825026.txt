Oswald is a fire fighter who is seen resting in bed inside the fire department. Also lying in bed beside him is his colleague, a horse. One day, a condo building went ablazed and calls for help from the scene were audible miles away. Oswald and his horse were at first reluctant to leaving their bed but still managed to rush toward the site on time. In their first rescue mission, Oswald scales a building to the floor where stranded mice are waiting. Oswald provides them a long rope which they used to slide downward. Next, Oswald and his companion moved to another building to salvage a hippo. Inside their targeted room, they found the hippo unconscious and started to carry it out the window. While Oswald was walking down the ladder and carrying the hippo, the massive weight of the large animal caused the ladder to collapse and those two to plummet into the sidewalk, leaving a hole. Nevertheless, Oswald comes out through a basement door, carrying the hippo single-handedly. The hippo regained consciousness.
