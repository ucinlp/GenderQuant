Pretty, popular and athletic Aly has been banking on a softball scholarship as her ticket to college. She has an active life and never seems to sit still. When she injures her knee, she realises that she will have to fund her education in other ways. She resents her mother because a few years ago, her mother became ill as a consequence binge eating and used the money from her daughter's college fund in order to pay her hospital bill. Aly is overly critical of her family's high-fat diet. She even refuses to eat a cake that her mother purchased for her. Aly enters a documentary film contest in hopes of using the prize money in order to fund her further education. Convinced that her overweight younger brother and mother use their struggles with weight as an excuse for everything wrong in their lives, Aly decides to take a summer course wearing a fat suit and hidden camera to prove personality can outshine physical appearance. But this high schooler has no idea how harsh the world can be through a "fat" girl's eyes. Aly soon realises how difficult the world can be for someone who is overweight. During her course, she is shunned by other students, despite her resolve to be kind and not to alter her personality. She meets Ramona, who is overweight and taking the same class as Aly. Ramona shares aspects of her personal life with her new friend and feels betrayed when Aly uses Ramona's words as part of her documentary.
