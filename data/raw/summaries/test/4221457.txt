The film takes place in a future where water is an immensely valuable substance, both as a commodity and as a currency. Princess Karina is a spoiled princess who purchases captured space pirates Jason and Roscoe. They then proceed to locate a "lost" planet that contains massive amounts of water. The planet must be approached on a specific course or the ship will be suspended in time forever. The course apparently contains some sort of real or illusory time distortion .
