Their friendship strained by love of the same woman, cowboy buddies Bobby Ray Burns and Pal Grisham return to hometown Cherub, Texas, to renew old ties and settle an old debt. In the thirty years since the pair split up, Bobby Ray's guitar picking and singing have won him gold records, while Pal's good looks have earned him silver-screen stardom—and the hand of the woman who divided them, Kitty O'Donnell. Known once around old Cherub as 'The Three Musketeers,' Bobby Ray, Pal, and Kitty come home to confront the past in this warm-hearted, cowboy valentine to friendship, love, and fidelity. Even as Cherub welcomes them back as celeb-heroes, Bobby Ray seeks to involve Pal in breaking into the town bank to make an anonymous deposit of $211.63 — repayment of a loan drawn on a whiskey-drinking night, years gone, that saw the 'Musketeers' go their separate ways. Complications ensue as they learn that the bank, much of the town, and Pal's ancestral ranch have fallen into the hands of antagonist, Cale Chason.
