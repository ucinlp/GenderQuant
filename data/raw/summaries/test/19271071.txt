Pralay , an orphan, is given shelter by Kaka Babu , just like the latter had given to the brother- sister orphans, Mainak  and Khushi . The three grew up like family members. When they grow up, Pranay falls in love with Chandni, the daughter of Tridib babu, the local don. Pralay and Mainak often clash with Tridibâ€™s men and always teach them a lesson. The entry of Sangeeta  creates a misunderstanding between the two, as Mainak has a crush for her, but he comes to know that Sangeeta loves Pralay. Siddhartha is a college-mate of Khushi. He was not getting any scope of conveying his love for her. Ultimately he joins as manager in the Mainak-Pralay company. But due to some misunderstanding Sangeeta has an impression that Pralay would marry her and Mainak was under impression that Pralay had chosen Chandni as his match. The comedy of errors continues till the entire confusion is cleared.
