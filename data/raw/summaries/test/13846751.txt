The film is an epic tale of Domenicos Theotokopoulos, best known as El Greco, a great Greek artist of the 16th century with an uncompromising character, who sets off from his homeland Crete and goes to Venice and finally Toledo, in search of freedom and love. There he is confronted by his greatest adversary, the Spanish Inquisition, but his creative consciousness and power make him stand out and overcome barbarity and ignorance. Being imprisoned and awaiting execution by the Spanish Inquisition, Domenicos  writes out his story, thus parts of his life play out in extended flashbacks. Born on the island of Crete, which was part of the Republic of Venice, he falls in love with Francesca , daughter of the Venetian governor of Crete. But his father is preparing a political rebellion and as a result Domenicos leaves the island and moves to Venice, away from the young woman. There he meets the famous painter Titian  and the Spanish priest Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara . Guevara immediately shows a confused interest in Domenicos, and, when roiled by the Greek - and fighting personal demons - calls Domenicos before the Inquisition where he must defend himself against charges of Heresy.
