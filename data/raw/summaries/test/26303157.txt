Dorothea "Dot" Parker  is a spoiled rich girl whose father invites a working stiff at his steel mill to dinner after the man saves several of his coworkers lives in an industrial accident. Dot's mother  is a hopeless snob who wants to call off dinner with a worker she deems lower class, but Mr. Parker, who is a far better judge of character, persists. Dot takes one look at her father's handsome employee Richard Brunton  and is hopelessly smitten. Dot wagers with her father that she will get a proposal from Richard and is soon collecting on her bet. The marriage initially threatens to emasculate Richard, who loses interest in his career and finds himself dominated by Dot's vapid, social whirl of bridge games, cocktail parties and passive acceptance of life as a "kept" man. He must ultimately put his foot down and assert to the spoiled heiress that he is the man of the house and that they must live honestly off of his income alone, much to the petulant Dot's initial distress. Though made in the years before Hollywood's Production Code placed uncompromising rules on the sex, drinking and violence that could be shown in movies, the romantic comedy Kept Husbands  is far from the racy content of other Pre-Code movies of the time. In fact, the film is in many ways highly conventional for how it reaffirms the gender roles in the Brunton household, arguing that the man and woman should fulfill their proper duties. In the Depression years, rich heiresses were not especially appealing figures for impoverished audiences. Conventions of the time demanded that haughty women like Dot be put in their place by the film's end.
