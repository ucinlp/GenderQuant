One day at the Swiss mountains, Oswald was milking a goat which would then runaway upon being called by another one passing by. As Oswald's goat jumps out of the scene, the bucket used was kicked off and was all over the rabbit's head. Oswald struggles to remove the pail but was able to get it off on time when he stumbled. Just then, his faithful St. Bernard dog came to him, carrying a message. The message was a distress note from the girl cat seeking Oswald's help. Oswald and the dog moved forth and head upland. Obstacles on the way include large rocks and a canyon, both of which they got through with little trouble. After a few more paces, they found the girl cat up a cliff and hanging onto a branch. To reach her, they stuck a ladder on top of a boulder. Oswald climbs up and collects the feline. It turns out momentarilly that the boulder was in fact a wolverine which wakes up and isn't happy to see them. Frightened by this, the dog runs off, carrying the ladder with Oswald and the girl cat still on it. Keeping away from the fierce predator, the three friends ran into a cave. When they reached the opened end, they found themselves on an edge thousands of feet above water. They then moved further from the exit and around the mount to hide themselves. The wolverine also enters the cave but was unaware of what lies ahead and therefore picks up speed. As a consequence, the wolverine overshoots the edge and plunges into the sea. Oswald and the girl cat ride the dog on their way back.
