{{Plot}} Johnny "Pono" Kapahala, a teen snowboarding champion from Vermont, returns to Oahu, Hawaii, for the wedding of his grandfather, local surf legend Johnny Tsunami. Johnny is excited for the marriage as he anticipates finally getting an uncle to hang out with until he realizes his "Uncle Chris" is a bratty 12 year old. The Dirt Devils, a dirt boarding group, tell Chris to do a dangerous stunt down a large sand dune on illegal property, but he is caught by the police. Johnny then bans Chris from dirt boarding, which further strains his relationship with Johnny. The next day, Sam and Johnny catch Chris heading off with the Dirt devils. They follow him to a barge set up with a skate park. Before Chris can skate, Johnny and Sam show him up by skating the barge. Annoyed, Chris runs away. When he gets home, he gets into a fight with Johnny and tells him to leave him alone. So, the next morning, Johnny goes surfing. He bumps into Val and gives her a surfing lesson, which makes Chris jealous and upset. Forced to hang out with Chris, Johnny and Sam blackmail him into coming along with him for a day. With Val, they go dirtboarding and ride ATVs. To his surprise, Chris has a good time, and he and Johnny finally start to get along. The group heads out to a dirt boarding event to meet Akoni Kama and possible sponsors, but the Dirt Devils kick Val out of their group for hanging with Johnny and Chris, the "competition". Chris runs away from home again, and when Johnny and Sam find him, Chris is fighting with Jared, the leader of the Dirt Devils, on joining his group. Chris agrees to do a dangerous jump the next day during the rehearsal dinner for Carla and Johnny's wedding, which is also the night before the opening of the shop. Johnny tells Chris that he isn't allowed to do the jump, so Chris tricks Johnny into thinking that he has changed and goes with Johnny to town to get items for the rehearsal dinner that night. Chris then runs away to find the Dirt Devils. By the time Johnny finds him, Chris has done the jump-and now has a broken arm/wrist. They go back home, and just as they begin to set aside their differences and get along, they get news of a break-in at Johnny's grandpa's shop, which is now trashed. Jared is immediately arrested after he is found with a bag of broken gear from the shop. Troy comes over and denies being involved in the break-in. He then tells Chris that he is fit to join the Dirt Devils, but both Johnny and his grandpa say no. Chris runs away once again, saying that he hates the family, leaving Carla feeling guilty about trying to force him into this new family. Carla decides to move back to Pennsylvania in a conversation with Johnny's Grandpa, which Chris overhears. He feels guilty about causing their break-up, but doesn't know how to mend it. Johnny then says that he is lucky he has a smart nephew and eventually, with help from Val, Sam and Johnny fix the surf shop. They decide to stop hanging out with the Dirt Devils. The opening of Johnny's grandpa's store, is a huge success and even pro-dirt boarder Akoni Kama comes. Meanwhile, across the street, the Dirt Devils, find Troy in a heated argument with Val's dad over negotiations for him to move to California. The Dirt Devils, betrayed and angry, turn on Troy. He then gets into a fight with Johnny's grandpa over who can sell dirt boards in their shop. Johnny, realizing that he's never seen the "godfather of dirt boarding" ride before tells him to be quiet and eventually challenges him to a mountain boarding race to see who can sell the dirt boards. If Johnny wins, they can both sell them and if Troy wins, he can sell them. Johnny and Chris finally reach terms of friendship and Chris helps Johnny with the race by describing the course set up by Val's father. The race begins with Troy in the lead for a large portion of the time, until the ending when he falls when doing one of three required tricks and crashes into the barrier at the finish line. Johnny wins, and both shops decide to sell dirt boards. Carla and Johnny finally decided to get married, and both families are finally happy. The movie's tagline caused much a stir for Disney. The tagline read, "Once you go snow, you do go back."
