Nancy, a.k.a. "Dr. Love", is a radio talk show host unskilled at practicing what she preaches. She eventually meets Mickey, a romeo with women whose wildly varied experiences and stories make people assume him to be a compulsive liar. Mickey also gets to know Eve, who is a former prostitute who now owns a bar bearing her name. The bar is in particular popular with people looking for one night stands. The three lead lonely, unfulfilling lives in Los Angeles. They have never met before, but their experiences become intertwined and complicate a number of lives.
