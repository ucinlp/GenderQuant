 The film tells of Rulo , a moderately successful musician in the 1970s. Today he's divorced and an unemployed forty-something day-laborer living in Buenos Aires in the late 1990s. He's anxious for whatever work he can find. He lives with his son who's also musically inclined, and his mother . His best friend Torres , who has connections in the Argentine construction industry, finds him work as a large crane operator. Rulo is dating Adriana , who runs a sandwich shop. He lands a job as an excavating machine operator in distant Patagonia. The workers live in a remote farmhouse and the relationship between management and labor is difficult. One day the workers are not fed during lunch so they refuse to work until they eat. Rulo soon discovers that making a fresh start at a late age proves to be harder than he first thought.
