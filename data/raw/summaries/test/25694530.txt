Nikki Cominsky  is a lawyer with problems in her married life. She moved from Cincinnati, Ohio and is working for a large law firm in the Chicago area. She invites her husband to have a romantic dinner at a local restaurant, but he has already made plans to go to a baseball game. Disappointed, she goes to work and sees an invitation for dinner at the very same restaurant that she was planning on going to with her husband. At first she is irked because she is sick of the local churches' attempts at getting new followers, but quickly realizes that this may be a romantic attempt from her husband. Excited, she goes to the restaurant, but sees a mysterious man claiming to be Jesus Christ . She thinks the man is crazy and attempts to leave, but the man persuades her to stay by telling her that he would tell her who sent him after dinner. Knowing that she would want to find out who is responsible, and not wanting to refuse a free dinner, she stays. The man begins to use real life examples such as family and other religions to tie in why Christianity is the one true religion, also as to why he really is, in fact, Jesus. Throughout their evening of conversation, arguments and debate, Nikki learns things she never knew about life, Heaven, Hell, other religions, the universe, and even herself. By the time dinner is over, she notices large spike scars on the man's wrists, and her life has been changed forever. He says that she was the one who sent for him, years before.
