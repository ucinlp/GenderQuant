"Cyclone" Tom Saunders, a free-spirited cowboy, is hired by a ranchers' association to look into a series of cattle thefts, for which they suspect a pair of "nesters". When Saunders discovers that the nesters are an old man and his pretty young daughter and could not be the rustlers, he begins to suspect that Nate Lenox, a bullying ranch foreman, might have something to do with it.
