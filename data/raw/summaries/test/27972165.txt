A group of elite interstellar commandos crash lands on a planet while transporting an alien prisoner. Amidst shifting loyalties among the group, they must track down and recapture the escaped creature, alive.{{Cite news}} The escaped prisoner sets up traps and picks the commandos off one by one. Soon there are only Commander Karza and Lieutenant Centauri 7 left. Centauri wants to kill the alien and be done with it, but the Commander insists that he be taken alive, regardless of the mounting cost. The two engage each other in a tense standoff, as Centauri demands to know why the prisoner is so important. The commander then reveals that the prisoner is the only survivor of its kind, whose planet was destroyed in war, and that he "plans to return the favor." The standoff is interrupted when the commander is killed by a sniper shot. The prisoner has a clear shot at Centauri as well, but declines for reasons not yet known, and moves off. Centauri begins to track the beacon implanted into the prisoner’s body, but when he finds it, it's another trap. The prisoner has torn the device out of his own flesh, and left it as a decoy to sneak up and ambush him. After knocking the Sedonian unconscious, the prisoner rummages through his gear until he finds a tool to cut off the "inhibitor mask," thus revealing himself as a human. The human steals Centauri’s gear and water, but leaves him alive. The human also steals Centauri's communication device and tries to access the Sedonian computer database through it. He is denied access, but he is still able to communicate with Centauri via the communicators. The two exchange a few words, in which the human fails to persuade Centauri to abort the mission and go back. There are a few narrow escapes and near captures of the human. During a lull in the chase, the human chats with Centauri, in the conversation, it is revealed that the Earth was destroyed because humans accepted refugees of a Sedonian enemy. Centauri announces for the second time that he will not stop until he kills the human. During a chase of the human, an inter-planetary bounty hunter is able to take the human captive. The bounty hunter begins to drag the human back to the ship with intent to cash in on the human's reward set by the Sedonians. Centari intercepts the bounty hunter and engages in battle with him. During the fray, the human escapes. Centauri finally captures his prey, Lieutenant Orin Jericho. He then calls for extraction, and sits down to wait. With bound hands and feet, Jericho criticizes the atrocities of the Sedonians, in a heated conversation with Centauri. But Centauri sees nothing wrong with enslaving other races and destroying anyone who opposes, as he calls it, "our way of life." After learning from Jericho that the humans have launched a cloaked ship, loaded with enough explosives to destroy the Sedonian homeworld, Centauri appeals to Jericho's sense of honor, and asks him to spare the lives of the innocent Sedonians who will be killed. He asks, "Is that what you want the legacy of your kind to be?" Jericho appears to relent, and wants to reveal the coordinates of the ship. Centauri orders his comlink to recognize Jericho as an authorized user, so that he can give the coordinates to "Alpha Base." The ship is quickly located, and Centauri is ordered to kill Jericho, since he is no longer needed. But, then Jericho reveals to Centauri, that the ship was a decoy. Jericho tells Centauri that there is nothing he can do, he has been playing for time, and now it is too late to save Sedonia. This thought distracts Centauri enough to allow Jericho to cut himself loose. Jericho defeats Centauri in a bit of hand to hand fighting and escapes again, now leaving him tied up. At this point, Jericho reveals that the bomb ship was in fact, never launched. Earth did not even know the location of Sedonia. His purpose all along was to force the crash, on this particular planet, and trick one of the Sedonians into giving him access to a comlink, so that he could use it to upload Sedonia's coordinates to the bomb ship. As he's leaving, he goes back to Centauri and says: "Do you want to know the difference between me and you?" as Centauri is trying to untie himself, Orin says "I did have a wife and a son back on Earth." Which has Centauri in a short period  thinking about that statement. Now disguised in Centauri's armor, he eliminates the arriving Sedonian extraction team, just as Centauri breaks loose from his bindings. Jericho proceeds to move towards a hidden hatch, buried in the sand. Before he can enter the hatch, Centauri has a clear shot at him, but now Centauri declines. He watches through a scope as Jericho drops into the hatch.  Jericho proceeds down the hatch, and launches in the bomb-ship hidden under the desert, only to discover that the AI chip has been plucked out of the comlink by Centauri, he cannot use it. Centauri finds the corpses of the extraction team, and snaps his own AI chip into one of their comlinks. He then responds rather rudely to a call from Alpha Base. Jericho monitors this communication from the ship, and the comlink warns Centauri that he doesn't have much time before the human traces the signal back to Sedonia. Centauri looks to the sky and says "He already has. Isn't that right, Earthman?" Then they both agree that they have something to talk about when they meet again, and Centauri begins to look for the bounty hunter's ship.
