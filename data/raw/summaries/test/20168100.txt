Batwoman employs the services of several young female agents known as "Batgirls", in her pursuit of justice. Her archenemy is a masked villain named "Rat Fink". Added to the mix is the President and Vice-President of the "Ayjax" Corporation. The company, using plutonium as its fuel source, has created a powerful listening device called "The Atomic Hearing Aid", which allows for limitless eavesdropping. The company has been ordered to destroy the hearing aid by the US Government when the government turned down the offer to buy the listening device  but the President of the company has refused to do so and now is being confronted by Rat Fink about selling him the device. The Vice President of Ayjax recruits Batwoman to protect the device but Rat Fink's minions use drugged bowls of soup to drug Batwoman and her allies and steal the device. The two storm the lair and retrieve it, unmasking Rat Fink and converting several of his minions to the side of justice after they fall in love with the Batgirls.
