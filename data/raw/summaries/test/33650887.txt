Young newsparer reporter Matt Harper  is dispatched from Nashville to cover the murder of the police chief of Amos, Alabama. There he meets Trey Hall , a 21-year-old "blue blood" who lives on her family's hunting plantation. She wants Matt to investigate the nearly 20-year-old unsolved killing of a black teenager, Wallace Sampson . Matt believes solving the murder will jump start his career, and he begins to investigate. Being distracted, he forgets an appointment related to his upcoming wedding, which casuses his fiancée Delana Calhoun  to call off their engagement. Matt asks his editor, Walker Burns , to let him look into the murder. While Burns notes that Matt is already on thin ice with the publisher  for a lack of productivity, Burns allows Matt some time to investigate, on the condition that politically-incorrect reporter Ronnie Bullock  accompany him. Matt and Ronnie discover old police files that point to a Klansman who operated 'The Store' near where the shooting occurred. The day before Wallace's murder, someone had attempted to firebomb 'The Store' during a civil rights protest. Just as the two reporters are making headway, Matt's ex-fiancée Delana tells Matt his father, Lucas , has cancer. Matt and Delana visit Matt’s father, but later fight because Matt hasn’t told his father about the broken engagement and because Matt is critical of his ill father. Matt and Bullock continue investigating without the publisher’s knowledge. One of their sources, Wallace’s mother Mary Pell Sampson , is reluctant to talk to them, and Matt begs Delana to help him in speaking to the woman. Delana reluctantly agrees, not for Matt, but because she dislikes someone getting away with murder. Mary Pell tells Delana that The Store was firebombed because it was a front for prostitution. The publisher discovers that Matt and Bullock are continuing to work on the story against his orders. After a public confrontation in which Matt challenges the publisher, Matt seeks his father’s help. Using his father's advice, Matt and Bullock subvert the publisher and renew the investigation. They ask Delana to help with the interview of Wallace’s girlfriend Vanessa , and Delana again becomes part of the team. Vanessa reveals a crucial clue about someone running from the scene. Matt and Bullock discover that Judge Buchanan  owned the store that was firebombed. Somebody in a car tries to run Delana off the road when she leaves Amos, but she escapes. Matt realizes how much Delana means to him and rushes to comfort her. He delivers a full and complete apology for his self-centered behavior. Matt and Bullock track down the man running from the scene, Billy ‘Possum’ Baker . They learn he’s been an anti-Klan informer and is still undercover. Baker is now dying, and he is no longer worried about the consequences of coming forward with the truth. Just as they publish the story, Matt’s father dies. Matt arrives in time to make his peace and to hear the words of approval he’s always craved. When Matt has to choose between doing the right thing and doing the professional thing, he makes the right choice, and Delana falls back in love with him. Matt and Bullock’s story leads to indictments. Evidence proves the same gun that killed Wallace Sampson also killed the police chief. The reporters foil an attempt on Possum's life the night before a hearing where everything is made clear and Mary Pell reveals a final shocking truth about the killer that leaves everyone gasping. The reporters receive a prize for investigative reporting. The town of Amos is transformed. Matt Harper has become a reporter with a conscience and someone who finally deserves Delana.
