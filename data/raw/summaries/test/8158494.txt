Harry Lucas  works at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington, D.C. He has an admirer in sweet co-worker Verna Baxter , who tries to woo him by giving him home-cooked  fudge, but he avoids her as he doesn't feel ready for anything serious. He also has an enemy in co-worker and supervisor Samson Link , who can't understand how Harry manages to live beyond his means. Unbeknownst to Link, Harry relies on free trials that enable him to take luxury apartments and ride in chauffeured cars, enjoying the good life, including romance with a sexy neighbor. After Harry accidentally drops $50,000 in new currency into a bag with Verna's fudge and leaves the mint with it, he inadverdently destroys the newly-minted money in a garbage disposal while dumping the fudge. He now fears Link and an audit at the mint. In desperation, Harry turns to Pop , a former mint employee forced into retirement who misses his job as a printer and now has little to live for except the company of his pregnant beagle. Pop agrees to help Harry sneak into the mint after hours and print up replacement currency. Harry learns that they will both need help from others to break in and print the missing $50,000. One by one, he has to offer a partnership to a safecracker named Dugan , a pawnbroker named Luther  who can front expenses, a boat Captain  who can navigate a secret passage to the mint through a sewer, plus several other men to pull off the heist. The conspirators accept an offer of $2,000 apiece at first, but as they rehearse for the big night, they decide to help Harry only on the condition that he and Pop will print them a million dollars apiece. An unexpected change at the mint forces the timing of the caper to be moved up, the group has to drop what they are doing and go in immediately. Despite rehearsals, many things go wrong during the job, not the least of which is Pop's dog going into labor. Verna is also upset when she discovers that far more money is being printed as Harry had assured her they were only going to replace the missing $50,000. The group manages to leave with the money, over seven million dollars in all, only to have it later lost when garbage collectors haul away the cardboard boxes containing the bills, placing them on a barge. Harry is defeated. He goes to the mint to confess to Link, knowing that he likely will lose his job and be sent to prison on a variety of felony charges. Pop saves the day, nonetheless when, on the steps of the mint, he turns up with $50,000 in extra bills that were printed and used to line a box in which his dog gave birth. Harry can replace the missing currency now, and he also has a new appreciation for the pure-hearted Verna.
