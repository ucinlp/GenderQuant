The film consists of five long takes set by the ocean. As in a typical Ozu film, the camera never moves, zooms or pans. There is no dialogue or, except for one shot, people at all. * First shot: A close-up of a section of beach. * Second shot: A seaside boardwalk, with people walking past. * Third shot: The same beach, taken from above. * Fourth shot: A short interlude, with ducks. * Fifth shot: A black screen that is revealed to be water at night when the moon's reflection appears.
