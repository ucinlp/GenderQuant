Wealthy French playboy Toto Duryea ([[Frank Fay  is irresistible to women, but is in love with none of them. According to Monsieur Rancour , for Toto, "every woman is like a new dish to be tasted." When he is finally and instantly smitten with American Diane Churchill , he has great difficulty proving to her and her father  that he truly loves her. Finally, he convinces her that he is sincere; Mr. Churchill insists that Toto give up his women and carousing and stay away from his daughter for six months to prove he has reformed. He also asks that Toto get examined by Churchill's doctor. Dr. Dumont  has bad news for Toto: his heart is so weak, even the excitement caused by so much as a woman's kiss would be fatal. Toto takes to his bed, but three of his girlfriends insist on nursing him: Fifi , Florine  and Dagmar . When they all converge on his bedroom and discover each other, they engage in a three-way catfight. Then an outraged husband  shows up to shoot him. Fortunately, Dr. Dumont arrives and divulges Toto's condition. The husband and the three women all leave. Then Diane shows up. Before she leaves with her father for America, she insists on spending an hour of passion with him. Unable to resist, he kisses her. When he remains alive, he upbraids the newly arrived Dr. Dumont for his faulty prognosis. Mr. Churchill explains that he had Dumont fake his diagnosis; it was all a test of Toto's claim that he loved Diane "more than life itself". Convinced, he gives Toto permission to marry Diane.
