David and Jason are estranged siblings, the former a depressive late-night radio talk-show host, the latter an extroverted con man. When Jason drags his younger brother and his  bitter aging beauty-queen squeeze, Sally, to a dreary Atlantic City and into a real-estate scam, events spiral toward tragedy. The skeptical David has no faith in Jason's scam. Jason chides David for wallowing in his dark, lonely depressed life. Sally becomes disgruntled and shoots Jason. David escorts his brother's corpse home to Philadelphia by train.
