10 to Midnight is a drama that mixes elements of police and slasher films. It portrays the homicidal behavior of Warren Stacy ([[Gene Davis , a young office equipment repairman who kills women after they reject his sexual advances. Two Los Angeles police detectives, Leo Kessler  and Paul McAnn , investigate his murders. Stacy avoids prosecution by constructing sound alibis and assaulting his victims while naked, thus minimizing evidence. McAnn refuses to go along when Kessler plants evidence in order to frame the suspect. Stacy goes on another rampage, killing three women who are friends with Kessler's daughter. When he is caught, stark naked in the street, Stacy boasts how he will say all the things that will "prove" that he is crazy: he hears voices telling him to do things, etc., so that one day, he will be back on the sreet and Kessler, as well as the "whole f-----g world," will hear from him again. Kessler replies, "No, we won't!" He then shoots Stacy once in the forehead, killing him. The film then ends.
