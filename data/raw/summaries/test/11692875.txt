A devil loses his left horn, which is found by an elderly man in Britain  who uses it as a hearing trumpet. Soon the man experiences a series of aural and visual hallucinations: A bug sounds like a locomotive; a butterfly causes him to see strange patterns; a short man in a pink suit makes mischief, at one point pulling a telephone from the horn and turning the phone's mouthpiece into a shower outlet. These hallucinations become steadily more strange and frightening before finally culminating in a "GIGANTIC EXPLOSION!" Having suffered enough, the gentleman leaves the horn behind in favor of his original hearing trumpet, which he had thrown out at the cartoon's beginning. After he leaves, the devil materializes and is glad to find his missing horn; he screws it back on and disappears. The cartoon ends with the moral: "The other fellows trumpet always looks greener".
