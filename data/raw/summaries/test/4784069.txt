Wassup Rockers is about a group of Guatemalan American and Salvadoran American teenagers in South Los Angeles who, instead of conforming to the hip hop culture of their gang-infested neighborhood, wear tight pants, listen to punk rock, and ride skateboards. Avoiding the violence of their dangerous home turf is an everyday challenge. Janice Dickinson makes an appearance in the film as a rich alcoholic divorcee whose Spanish-speaking maid help Los Rockers & fashion designer Jeremy Scott appears as a photographer.
