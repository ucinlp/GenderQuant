The movie does not offer a linear interpretation of the life of Eva Per√≥n. Instead, it focuses on the political disputes during the last year of Eva's life. These disputes involved Women's suffrage in Argentina, failed coup attempts against the Peronist government, and Eva's failed bid for the vicepresidency. The movie concludes with Eva's death in the year of 1952.
