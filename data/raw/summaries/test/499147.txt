Richard Dadier  is a teacher at North Manual High School, an inner-city school where many of the pupils, led by student Gregory Miller , frequently engage in anti-social behavior. Dadier makes various attempts to engage the students' interest in education, challenging both the school staff and the pupils. He is subjected to violence as well as duplicitous schemes; he first suspects Miller, but later realizes that Artie West  is the perpetrator, and challenges him in a classroom showdown.
