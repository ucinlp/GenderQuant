Làn fhìrinn na sgeòil {{IPA-gd}}. The truth is in the story. When a young man, Angus, visits his dying grandfather in hospital he cannot hold back his boyhood quest for the truth - the truth behind the death of his parents and the truth behind his grandfather's ancient, incredible, fearful stories. Stories from the whole swathe of Gàidhealtachd history of poisoned lovers, bloody revenge, water-horses and Spanish gold. His grandfather hijacks Angus' life, for one last time leading him to one of Scotland's most treacherous mountains, the Inaccessible Pinnacle on the Isle of Skye, and an ancient truth he never expected to find.
