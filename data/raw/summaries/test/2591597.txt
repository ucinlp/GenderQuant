Colour Me Kubrick begins with a direct homage to A Clockwork Orange with the after-effects of one of Alan Conway's  minor cons: two thugs are sent to collect a bar bill that Conway has generated by impersonating Kubrick. Conway has provided the address of an elderly couple as Kubrick's home address. Conway is nowhere to be seen, and the thugs are arrested by the police for causing a ruckus outside the house. Following these events, the audience is taken through several of Conway's scams, including tricking a fashion designer, members of a heavy metal band, and a popular bar owner. All of the victims are deceived into giving in to "Kubrick" for sums of money, free food and drinks, and even sexual favours. Conway actually knows little about Kubrick or his movies, so he simply puts on a different persona &mdash; from reserved English gentleman to flamboyant Jewish stereotype &mdash; with each victim. Conway deceives just about everyone he meets into thinking he is the reclusive director, except for a rent boy at a bar, who tests Conway by saying that his favourite Kubrick film is Judgment at Nuremberg; when Conway begins an anecdote about directing the film, the young man tells him that Judgment at Nuremberg was directed by Stanley Kramer, and Conway walks away. Conway also has a run-in with Frank Rich , a journalist from the New York Times. He meets Rich and his wife in a restaurant and confronts him about an article the New York Times ran on the real Kubrick. He is personally offended that the paper called Kubrick a recluse, and wants them to know that he shaved off his beard. After this chance meeting, Rich instigates Kubrick to look further into the identity of the man he met. One of the biggest scams is when Conway promises to help establish Lee Pratt ([[Jim Davidson  as a performing star in Las Vegas. Pratt is a British entertainer that has seen limited success as a flamboyant dancer and stage singer. Pratt is described as a "low-rent Liberace with an Elvis gleam in his eye."<ref name Colour Me Kubrick Review New York Times | work  http://movies.nytimes.com/2007/03/23/movies/23kubr.html | accessdate Stephen | last2007-03-23}} Conway makes huge promises to get Pratt a permanent seat in the spotlight in Las Vegas. While Pratt, Conway, and Pratt's manager try to decide how to conquer America, Conway lives a life of luxury on Pratt's bill. He sleeps in a high class hotel consuming vodka and cigarettes, until Pratt's manager becomes suspicious and catches Conway in the act. Conway is thrown out of Pratt's life and off a pier in a homage to Barry Lyndon. From there, Rich exposes Conway's lies, and Conway is sent to a hospital after an apparent nervous breakdown &mdash; which, of course, is another of Conway's elaborate ruses. His case is published by his doctor and he is sent to the Rimini Clinic, a centre where famous celebrities go for rehabilitation. Conway is shown to be living the good life, and the movie ends with him relaxing in a hot tub (with the Ray Noble Orchestra with Al Bowlly version of "Midnight, the Stars and You" playing on the soundtrack, harking back to the finale of [[The Shining .
