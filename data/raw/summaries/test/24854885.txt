Alfie  and Helena  divorce. Helena begins seeing fortune teller Cristal  for spiritual advice. Their daughter Sally  has a troubled marriage with author Roy , who once wrote a successful book, and is now anxiously waiting for response from his publisher about the manuscript of his newest one. Helena helps pay their rent. Alfie marries a prostitute, Charmaine . Roy falls for Dia , a musicologist he sees through a window near his and Sally’s flat, who is engaged to another man. Sally considers having an affair with Greg , her new boss at an art gallery who she confesses she has feelings for but Greg confesses he is having trouble at home and eventually it turns out he is having an affair with Iris , Sally's protégé. Roy's book is rejected. He hears that a friend, who is also a writer, has died in an accident, and of whom only Roy knows that he had just finished a manuscript that he had not shown to anyone else yet. Roy steals it, and claims it is his work. It is well received. He convinces Dia to break off her engagement, and moves in with her. Alfie gets into a fight and worries about Charmaine's high expenses. He asks Helena to make a new start with him, but she refuses because she feels attracted to a keeper of an occult bookshop, a widower. Charmaine has sex with another man and gets pregnant. Alfie wants a DNA test to find out whether he is the father, while Charmaine argues that it does not matter. Sally quits her job and asks Helena for a loan she promised, for setting up her own art gallery, but Helena refuses because according to Cristal it is astrologically a bad time. Sally is furious. Roy is informed that there was a mix-up of the persons killed in the accident, and is shocked to hear that the friend whose manuscript he stole is actually in coma and recovering. In the end, all are dissatisfied with their choices, except for Helena. She has acquired from Cristal a belief in reincarnation, and sees her life now as only one episode in her series of lives. She starts a relationship with Jonathan , the keeper of an occult bookshop. He also has esoteric beliefs, and they have first received the blessing of his deceased wife for the new relationship.
