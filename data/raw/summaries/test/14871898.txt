Set in 17th-Century Japan, "Zen" is the chronicle of a young samurai, Master Mitzu Zen, who learns the secret way of killing vampires while learning about women and life in general. Master Zen , a naive master who doesn't know anything about women and love, goes on a quest to find out the truth about his parents' sacred sword. While meeting people along the way, he ends up running into more than he bargained for when he starts encountering vampires.
