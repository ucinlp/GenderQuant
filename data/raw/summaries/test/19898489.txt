The film mainly is a about a tawaif , who accidentally enters the life of Dawood  who already has fallen in love with an upcoming writer . The situation becomes such that he has to claim that she  happens to be his wife. Soon the Tawaaif makes room in everybody's heart by her softness and intelligence, love and affection. It becomes difficult for Dawood as he cannot forget his first love , nor the Tawaaif  and also that he cannot tell the identity of Rati to anybody else. However, gradually all problems are solved, misunderstandings removed and Dawood willingly accepts Rati while Suleman Seth  who also loves Poonam, accepts her. The songs of the film were nicely written by Hassan Kamal and composed by Chopra's favourite Ravi. The song 'Tere Pyar Ki Tamanna' and 'Bahut De Kar Di' are very meaningful and ear-pleasing.
