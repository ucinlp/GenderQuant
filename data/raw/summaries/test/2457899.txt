The disaster actually took place at a place called Chasnala in erswhile Bihar . The film, though not a commercial hit then, had it's own intensity and fire in it. Especially for the character Vijay Pal Singh played by Yash Chopra's favorite Vijay Amitabh Bachchan. He didn't have much dialogues and he rather emoted with his fiery eyes. His base baritone set the right tone for the content and his various emotions come out in the form of frustration, anger, love, compassion and disgust. His chracter was neatly supported by many other legends of that time like Shashi Kapoor, Shatrughan Sinha, Raakhee Gulzar, Parveen Babi, Prem Chopra etc. The movie is now termed as a Yash Chopra classic.
