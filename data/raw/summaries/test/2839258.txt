In 1976{{fact}}, campers pull a prank on the caretaker, Cropsy , during the night. They sneak into his cabin and set up a skull next to his bed with candles in the eye sockets. When Cropsy awakens to the campers banging on his window, he is so frightened by the skull that he knocks it onto his bed where it ignites his sheets and clothes. Aflame, Cropsy leaps from his bed and knocks over a gas tank, causing flames to spread through the cabin. The boys watch as Cropsy, engulfed in flames, stumbles out and falls into a river. Five years later, Cropsy is released from hospital, wearing a coat, sunglasses and hat to hide his deformities. Out of rage, he murders a prostitute. He then sets out to another summer camp named "Camp Stonewater". Cropsy arrives and tries to attack a female camper,tiger, but he hesitates. The next morning, camper Sally  showers and pulls back the curtain, exposing camper Alfred , who runs away. Sally's screams bring Karen , Michelle , Todd ([[Brian Matthews  and Eddy , who catch Alfred. Michelle demands Alfred leave, but Todd talks to him. Todd learns that Alfred has no friends, and was pulling a prank on Sally. Glazer  later attacks Alfred, but Todd tells Glazer to cool off, and Alfred apologizes to Sally. That night, Alfred spots Cropsy outside his window, but no one believes him. At the mess hall, Karen tells Michelle that she and Eddy are going to sleep together, but she should return before morning. After supper, Karen and Eddy go to a lake to skinny dip. Just as Eddy and Karen are about to have sex, Karen reconsiders, upsetting Eddy. Upon leaving, Karen discovers her clothes strewn in the woods. As she collects them, Cropsy grabs her and slits her throat. The next morning, Michelle finds Karen has not returned. She and Todd find Eddy, who tells them she left. They discover the canoes have been cut adrift on the lake that surrounds the camp. Michelle does not believe Karen is the culprit, so some campers create a raft to collect the canoes, while other campers and counselors gather wood. Eddy, Fish and Woodstock  board the finished raft, along with two female campers. Alfred begins to explore, while Todd reassures Michelle that Karen is fine. Eddy and the campers spot a canoe and paddle toward it, only to have Cropsy jump out and kill them all with his shears. Michelle worries about Karen, while Todd takes Dave , Alfred and others on a camp out. As night falls, Glazer finally has sex with Sally, but suffers premature ejaculation. He later goes to get matches to start a fire and resume their intimacy. Cropsy then appears behind Sally, and shoves his shears into her chest. Alfred finds the spot where the couple stayed, and watches as Glazer returns. He uncovers Cropsy, thinking he is Sally. Cropsy pins Glazer to a tree with his shears. Alfred returns to the others. He awakens Todd and tells him about what he just saw. Todd does not believe him until he finds the bodies. He is then attacked by Cropsy, who knocks him out, and chases Alfred. Alfred is chased, while Todd chases after Cropsy with an axe. The campers see a raft moving towards them with no one on board moving. When Michelle approaches the raft, she discovers it is full of dead bodies. On the island, she rows the remaining kids towards the campsite. Meanwhile, Cropsy has captured Alfred, and drags him towards an abandoned mineshaft. Todd follows nearby, and hears Alfred's screams, finally tracking him down to the mineshaft, where Alfred has the garden shears embedded into his arm, pinning him to the wall. Michelle returns with the campers, and calls the police to helicopter the kids and survivors to safety. Todd looks through the mine opening for Cropsy and Alfred. When he steps across a piece of track, a mine car up on a raft rolls down, causing him to fall. He falls through a wall and discovers Karen's body, hanging from the ceiling. He and Cropsy struggle, and when Cropsy's disfigurement is shown, he remembers he was involved in the original prank. Alfred takes the shears, finds Cropsy and Todd, and helps stab Cropsy. The police arrive, while Michelle travels by boat to find Todd and Alfred. While Todd and Alfred are leaving, Cropsy attacks them. Alfred ignites Cropsy's clothes and Alfred hits him with an axe. Afterward, Alfred and Todd make their way out to Michelle, who brings them to the helicopter and to the hospital.
