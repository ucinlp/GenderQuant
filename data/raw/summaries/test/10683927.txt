It is the portrait of a bourgeois Italian family seen through the eyes of Carlo, an old retired professor who is the last patriarch of his family. The memoirs of Carlo characterizes the entire film, from the time of the Belle Epoque until the eighties, through two world wars, the economic boom, love, friendship and all the events which constitute human life. All without changing their place of action: the film unfolds all around the apartment bought by the grandfather of Carlo. The family and its dynastic succession and with his habits.
