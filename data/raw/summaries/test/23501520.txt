Middle school history teacher Tom Robinson  lives in Las Vegas with beloved wife Elizabeth . On a horse riding trip out in the desert one day, Elizabeth comes across an illegal immigration deal gone bad, with gangster Jimmy Dolan  executing a man. Elizabeth is seen, however, and narrowly escapes Dolan's thugs firing at her. The Robinsons go to the authorities, and an official  admits them into the Witness Protection program. Soon after, Elizabeth rushes out of their hotel, Tom following after her. When she tries to start their car, it explodes in front of Tom, killing Elizabeth. Devastated, Tom begins drinking, and eventually decides to seek revenge against Dolan. He purchases a handgun, a massive Smith & Wesson Model 500, and follows Dolan around town, eventually going after him one night. But before he can take the shot, a rival business of Dolan's pulls a drive-by, which fails because Dolan's Cadillac is revealed to be bulletproof. Robinson continues to follow Dolan, who soon notices and learns his identity. The two meet at a Rest Stop in the Nevada desert, ending with a confrontation in which Dolan allows Robinson to live , believing life to be more painful for Robinson than death. Undeterred, Robinson gets a job with a construction crew working on the roads Dolan often travels. After strenuous preparation, Robinson sets his trap: a giant pothole deep in the road, large enough to trap a car but not so large as to allow Dolan to escape. When Dolan's car falls into the hole, the driver is killed and another passenger , whom Dolan shoots as a mercy killing , is injured. Once Dolan has been trapped, Robinson makes his presence known, telling Dolan that he is a motorist who witnessed what had happened. Dolan, however, eventually realizes that the motorist is, in fact, Robinson, and begins to beg Robinson to let him go. Robinson begins to fill up the pot hole with dirt, continuing to taunt Dolan with possibilities of his escape, none of which come to fruition. The official from the Witness Protection program soon calls Robinson to tell him that Dolan had been on his way to a major transaction involving child sex trafficking, a crime that would have destroyed Dolan. Robinson doesn't care, however, and finishes filling the hole up. Robinson lays concrete blocks over the Cadillac, while Dolan screams from within the hole. The official calls back and tells Robinson they now have enough for a conviction. Robinson drops the phone and laughs maniacally.
