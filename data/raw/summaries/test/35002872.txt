Jean-Max, Axel, Jean-Michel, George and their "dalons", their friends, live near Dos d’Ane, a small village in the hills of Réunion Island. An athlete, a musician, a specialist in herbs, a scientist... They all love nature in their own way. From the nostalgia of nature’s generosity to its actual fragility, their outlooks change. Can the Circle of Mafate, way up high, continue to be the sanctuary of so many so.
