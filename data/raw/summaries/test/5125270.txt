The telefilm starts with the mayor as Norm the Genie with his new master. He wishes for a sandwich, and then to be mayor of the world. Eventually, he angers the citizens and is about to be put in a guillotine. Norm, who has come up with an evil plan, gives a note to the mayor and tells him to say it. It says to wish that everything was back to normal and Norm was in the hands of Timmy Turner's best friend, Chester McBadbat. Norm is then sent to Chester, who wishes that Timmy could play with him. Norm goes to Timmy's house and tells him that he will create a clone. The clone would do everything at home while the real Timmy has fun with Chester. However, once Timmy leaves, the clone gives Cosmo and Wanda a hard time. When Timmy returns home from a fun day with Chester, he finds out that Cosmo and Wanda, tired of the clone mistreating them, have quit being his fairy godparents. Jorgen Von Strangle appears and wipes Timmy's mind, making him forget everything that has happened. However, it is then revealed that he wiped the mind of the clone. In Fairy World, everyone finds out that Cosmo and Wanda have quit. A singing contest is then held to find a replacement fairy . Norm also makes Chester's dad the best baseball player in the world before heading off to Fairy World. Timmy needs to get his fairies back, so he travels to Fairy World via Crocker's Teleporter, but is captured by two security guards. Meanwhile, four contestants have sung their songs: a Japanese fairy William Hung, a Wicked Witch , the Tooth Fairy, and some Lawn Gnomes. Timmy then disguises himself as Mr. Crocker to mislead the security guards. The April Fool, Juandissimo Magnifico, Cupid, and Sanderson the Pixie have now performed, and the only contestants left to do so are Norm and Cosmo. Timmy then shows up. He makes up with his fairies and Cosmo performs . Cosmo and Wanda are announced the winners, but Norm crushes them with a wrecking ball. He is then made a fairy and his godchild is the miserable Chester McBadbat, who's father was arrested and home bankrupt. Eventually, Cosmo and Wanda survive, but Chester wishes that Norm was Timmy's fairy. However, Timmy makes Norm go two weeks without wishing. He then turns to confetti. Norm poofs back and tells Timmy that he quits and Jorgen poofs in and erases Timmy's memory by flashing him so many times and saying that it will stay wiped and turns Norm back into a genie. After finding out Norm used him to destroy Timmy, Chester uses his last genie wish and wishes everything back to normal and Norm back into his lamp. As Jorgen was about to take Cosmo and Wanda away, he sees the lamp and poofs away with it. Timmy apologies to Cosmo and Wanda and gives them a day off magic but they both turn to confetti and the episode ends with Cosmo saying the last line: "Look! I'm made of string! Yay!"
