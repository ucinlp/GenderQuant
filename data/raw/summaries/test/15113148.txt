The film is based at the  St Swithins Hospital, with Leslie Phillips as Dr Gaston Grimsdyke, an accident-prone doctor and cad, more interested in the nurses than the patients. Grimsdyke is sacked from his job as a medical officer at a men's prison, for his behaviour with the Governor's daughter, so he enrols in a refresher course with his old medical tutor Sir Lancelot Spratt , who he is determined to make him a successful surgeon. Grimsdyke discovers that a plum senior medical post is shortly to become vacant, and starts scheming to be considered, instead of his cousin, who has already been unofficially offered the job. Spratt and the newly-appointed hospital matron clash, leading Spratt to 'volunteer' Grimsdyke to romance her and 'soften her up'. But she mistakenly believes Spratt to be her admirer, and many funny and inevitable complications ensue. At a hospital dance, a 'rejuvenation serum' which Grimsdyke has accidentally injected into Sir Lancelot, causes the latter to run amok at the party and romance the new matron. She decides to resign and a new matron is appointed. But she turns out to be equally opposed to Spratt's ideas of how the hospital ahould be run.Britmovie accessed 08/01/08
