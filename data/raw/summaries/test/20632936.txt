The Pink Panther is visiting a Middle Eastern county, and immediately gets himself into trouble when his tail gets enchanted by a snake charmer's flute, and the tail and the rope in the snake charmer's basket fall in love with each other. Later, a straw of spaghetti on the panther's dinner plate also gets amorous with the tail, so the panther has to resort to plastic surgery to get himself a genuine fox tail, hoping to escape the trouble.
