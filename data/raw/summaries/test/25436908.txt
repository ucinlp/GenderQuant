Nina Hamilton  is a happily married children's book author and illustrator, who along with her doctor husband Noah  have been trying several times to have a baby, when they suddenly move back to Noah's hometown. When they move back they agree to try another round of in vitro fertilization. Nina meets Callie , a waitress, the two become fast friends, though Nina doesn't know the extent of Callie's background with Noah. The two were dating in high school and Noah performed an abortion on her when she got pregnant with their baby. One day Nina's beloved cat Tess is found dead and Nina is devastated. Nina and Noah go in for another unsuccessful round of in-vitro, and is distraught that she can't get pregnant, and is told there are only two embryos left and set another appointment. Callie, becoming increasingly obsessive of Noah, goes in for the procedure and learns, while she's with Nina, that she's pregnant. Though happy for Callie, Nina is unaware that Callie is carrying her child with Noah, and is saddened that she's not pregnant. Nina and Callie go shopping for the baby, where Nina tells her she can do more with her life and should look into other career paths such as real estate. Callie agrees and asks a female real estate agent if she can apply. The woman, having a low opinion of Callie, rudely dismisses her. Callie comes back later and kills her. Nina starts becoming suspicious of Callie's pregnancy when she learns the father is married and starts after going in for her final in vitro procedure and learns that the embryos were implanted already. Distraught and angry, Nina suspects that Callie did it after learning of her past with Noah. Noah tells her they can't just go out and accuse her without evidence. Nina goes over to Callie's apartment when she is off to work and finds pictures of Noah, a blond wig similar to Nina's hair color and takes them. While leaving she accidentally sets the apartment on fire. Nina offers Callie a place to stay  which Callie agrees to. Nina's mother stops in for a visit and instantly likes Callie, despite her suspicion after being told by Nina of her distrust for Callie. Callie and Nina's mother talk of food cravings and she inadvertently tells Callie of her allergy to peanut butter. Callie bakes a cake mixed with peanut butter and offers a piece to Nina's mother, who starts to asphyxiate. Callie withholds her medicine and watches her die. Nina confronts Callie and leaves to make arrangements for her mother's funeral while Noah stays with Callie, who starts flirting with him openly. Nina returns home and sees Callie making passes and the two argue. Callie goes into labor and they all rush to the hospital. Callie delivers a little girl and is overjoyed as is Noah, who holds the baby while Nina is left to feel like an outsider. Once they return home, Nina sees Callie packing up her things, ordering her out. Callie tells her that Nina has no place in this family, as Callie has done the one thing Nina could not; give Noah a baby, and threatens her with a knife. Noah shows up and sees the situation and tells Nina to go. Nina sneaks back in later trying to take the baby. Callie catches her, and holds a knife to Noah's throat, telling him to choose the baby or Nina. He chooses the baby, and Callie tells him to kill Nina once and for all. He walks with Nina into the other room and there is a gunshot and Nina screaming. Callie tells him he made the right choice, and stabs him, knowing he was lying and goes to put the baby upstairs. She faces off with Nina on the stairs telling her no one will take the baby. They both hear the baby crying and Nina tries to rush up for her. They both struggle and fall down the stairs. Nina gets up and sees that Callie was stabbed by the knife, and rushes up to get the baby and walks past Callie who sees them reunite with Noah and then dies.
