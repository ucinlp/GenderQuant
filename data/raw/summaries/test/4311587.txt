"Egypt in the year 1900". A mummy is discovered by three Egyptologists: Englishmen John Bray ([[Ronald Howard  and Sir Giles Dalrymple  as well as French Professor Eugene Dubois . Assisting in the expedition is Professor Dubois' daughter, and Bray's fiancee, Annette , herself an Egyptology expert. All the artifacts are brought back to London by the project's backer, American showman Alexander King , who plans to recoup his investment by staging luridly sensational public exhibits of the Egyptian treasures. Soon after arrival, however, the mummy revives and starts to kill various members of the expedition, while it becomes evident that sinister Adam Beecham , a wealthy arts patron whom members of the expedition meet on the ship returning to England, harbors a crucial revelation of the mummy's past and future.
