Set in Paris, the story concerns the exploits of wealthy Jack Forbes , who bets his friend Michael Cummings ([[John Halliday  that he can woo and win Looloo Carroll  without using any of his money or connections. Cummings hires Simon and Peter ([[Ole Olsen , a pair of erstwhile detectives, to make sure that Forbes doesn't win his bet. Instead, Simon and Peter befriend our hero and decide to help him out. Olsen & Johnson have all the best material, notably an early double entendre encounter with a randy American tourist  and a scene in which Olsen impersonates a mind-reading fakir  -- who loses his clothes in the process! The finale has the comedians being chased by every law officer in Paris.
