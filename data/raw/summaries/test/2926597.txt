The film depicts the Lin family's experiences during the White Terror. The eldest brother Wen-heung  is murdered by a Shanghai mafia boss, the middle brother Wen-leung  suffers a traumatic brain injury in a KMT jailhouse, and the youngest brother Wen-ching , who is both deaf and mute, hopes to flee to the mountains with his friend to fight in the anti-KMT resistance movement. By the end of the film even the photographer Wen-ching has been arrested by the authorities, leaving only his wife to tell the story of the family's destruction. Wen-ching's deafness began as an expedient to disguise Tony Leung's inability to speak Taiwanese , but wound up being an effective means to demonstrate the brutal insensitivity of Chen Yi's ROC administration.
