Foghorn Leghorn takes pity on Miss Prissy, whom the other hens are ridiculing because of her inability to lay an egg. To give her confidence, Foghorn slips one of the other hen's eggs in Miss Prissy's nest. Before long, the egg hatches a rooster chick. When Foghorn finds, he is not pleased at the presence of another rooster. Seeing the hens glares, he decides to play along, but quickly finds out it may not be long before the little rooster chick takes over Foghorn. Foghorn makes some attempts to get rid of the rooster chick under the premise of teaching the chick to be a rooster. However, each of these attempts ends with Foghorn getting the worst end of things, until finally Foghorn decides to have a talk with the farm owner, but he gets caged and taken away in a truck.
