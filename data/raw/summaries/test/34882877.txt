{{Plot}} A group of young adults, Chris , his girlfriend Natalie , and their mutual friend Amanda , are traveling across Europe. They stop in Kiev, Ukraine, to visit Chris's brother, Paul , before heading on to Moscow where Chris intends to propose to Natalie. After a night on the town, Paul suggests that they go on an "extreme tour" of the abandoned town of Prypiat which sits in the shadow of Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, site of the infamous disaster, since the city is only 100 km from Kiev. They are joined by a backpacking couple, Norwegian Zoe  and Australian Michael ([[Nathan Phillips . The group arrives at the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone checkpoint, in which they are banned by the Ukrainian military but their tour guide, Yuri , takes them in through an unmanned, forested checkpoint, entering the Zone. On the way they stop at a river where they discover a large, mutated fish with large teeth dead at the side of the river. As the group returns to the van, a number of similar fish are seen below the murky water attacking a piece of beef jerky Yuri threw earlier on. They spend a few hours exploring the abandoned city, which was home to Chernobyl workers and their families before they were forced to evacuate overnight. When Yuri takes them into an apartment building they see a dead dog at the entrance. Yuri takes them to the upper floors and shows them the Chernobyl arc reactor no.4. While the group takes pictures, Yuri goes to the adjacent room where he finds something on the floor which he hides from the group. Just as they are about to leave, Yuri hears a noise. When he slowly goes to investigate, a bear comes out from an adjacent room and runs away. Frightened, the group leaves the building. Yuri comments on the incident, telling the group he has been coming to Chernobyl for five years and has always seen a dog or wolves but never a bear. As the group prepares to leave, Yuri finds the wires in his van have been chewed through and tries to radio for help to no avail. As night falls, the group begins arguing and affixing blame. Noises are heard outside and Yuri goes out with a flashlight and a gun, accompanied by Chris. Shots are heard and Paul runs out to investigate, only to return with Chris whose leg has been severely mauled, seemingly by dogs. The dogs proceed to attack the van after which the light in the van goes out. The group is forced to tend to Chris's leg with only the illumination of a cell phone light. The next morning, Paul, Michael, and Amanda go out looking for Yuri who, according to Chris, was taken by "them". They follow a trail of blood to find Yuri's mutilated body in an underground complex. They take his gun and Geiger counter and barely escape a pack of mutant creatures. They return to the van, planning to hike to the nearest checkpoint. While the group argues about who stays behind with Chris, Amanda checks the camera. She finds a creature in the picture of an apartment building she took earlier in the day. After much arguing Chris and Natalie stay behind while the others go to get help. Paul gives Natalie the gun and a radio just in case they don't come back. The group starts walking along a road until they see a couple of dogs up ahead feeding on something and they make the decision to go through the woods. The group comes across abandoned vehicles in a parking lot and find a bus with bullet holes that appear to have been shot from the inside. In the bus they find broken guns, a bloody guard uniform, and a flash light. Michael finds replacement wires for the van and Paul contacts Chris and Natalie via radio. The dogs come to attack them again, but the group manages to lose them. While crossing a lake, Michael falls in and is attacked by fish in the water, with the attack severely damaging his leg. Night falls and the group is walking on a road with the help of a flashlight. Amanda tells the others about the picture from the camera, and then a figure is seen running behind them in the dark. They reach the van and find it ripped apart and flipped over. Natalie's video camera reveals she and Chris were taken by the mutants. They go in search of the two but end up being chased by more mutants. During their escape they find a traumatized Natalie and rescue her. When the group is out in the open, they begin to work out where another checkpoint nearby is by using a map Michael obtained during their previous escape. The group is distracted by a little girl in the distance. As they try to communicate with her, Natalie is once again taken by the mutants. Paul, Michael, Amanda, and Zoe attempt to find her, but in the process are swarmed by a horde of mutants. They retreat to a fallout shelter, but Michael is captured. The three continue on, finding Chris' engagement ring for Natalie but no sign of Chris himself. They are again attacked by mutants and, as they begin to climb a ladder leading to the way out, a gang of mutants pull Zoe back down, forcing Amanda and Paul to leave her as they escape. Paul and Amanda continue on through the fallout shelter which comes out in the Chernobyl power plant itself. As they navigate the reactor, Paul finds radiation levels are very high and their skin begins to blister. They continue on and find Natalie's body. They manage to find their way out of the reactor, only to be confronted by Ukrainian military personnel. Blinded from radiation poisoning, Paul is shot dead when he approaches the soldiers. Amanda passes out and awakens on a gurney where several doctors, clad in protective hazmat suits, inform her that she is in a hospital. The doctors talk amongst themselves and reveal that the "creatures" were escaped patients that have been recaptured and, since the other Americans are dead, they decide Amanda, having seen the escapees, must not be allowed to leave. She is later thrown into a dark isolated room. Amanda is immediately alerted as she begins to hear noises. She calls out and a group of mutants attack her.
