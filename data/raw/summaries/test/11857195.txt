On the countertop, Bob and Larry welcome everyone to the show. Larry is acting nervous because he's hiding a toy aardvark behind his back. Bob asks why he's doing this Larry responds because he broke the aardvark craft which belongs to his father  following a trip to Indianapolis and since his father loves the animal he's afraid he'll hate him for breaking it. Bob is shocked and it also reminds him of a letter they got from a boy in Iowa who has been stealing things from others and is ashamed to go back to God because he thinks God hates him. And so, Bob plays the story. Darby played by Junior Asparagus resides at the O' Gill farm and is the son of a Kansas floss farmer who, more than anything else in the world, just wants to have fun. When he learns about the Wonderful Land Of Ha’s – an amusement park with all the fixins – and its mysterious Wizard who promises to make his dreams come true, Darby is determined to go with his money despite his father warning that it is for college in the future. When his father tells him he’s needed to help with the harvest, Darby decides that nothing is going to stop him and he makes a choice that will change his life forever. The Silly Song focuses on Bob and Larry in a safari scene on the countertop looking at various animals. During their discussions, Larry reveals that he was told the difference between monkeys and apes ("If it has a tail its a monkey, if it doesn't have a tail it's an ape" and than goes on to use this theory on everything else around him such as cows, comets, kites, lions, and even Bob. Back to the story, Darby, with his pet pig Tutu by his side, flees the cornfields and sets off to find the Wonderful Land Of Ha’s as a tornado sweeps them away while inside a farmhouse. Along the way he meets a bored scarecrow, a tin man who wants to ride roller coasters, and a lion that craves cotton candy. Each with their own dreams, they set off to see the Wizard in the Wonderful Land of Ha's, the funnest place on Earth. They spend a great deal of time there with their dreamed activities but then run out of money, whereupon they are forced to leave. The wizard  informs Darby that he is a phony business man who used his wizard identity to make money for his living. Darby is disappointed and afraid that his father will hate him for spending the funds planned for college and is upset that the businessman will give him nothing due to being broke on money. When Darby argues with the wizard about the commercial lies and threatens to inform the world of his intents, the businessman keeps him hostage in the basement and continues his business. However Darby's friends eventually break him out of the basement and publicly humiliate the fake Wizard as well as a bully that taunted Darby throughout the film about his decision. In the ending Darby sadly leaves his friends and goes back home and apologizes to his dad and offers to become a slave but his father refuses his offer and accepts him as his son despite the sin. Back at the kitchen, Larry has learned that his dad will love through thick and thin because he loves him and God. And the boy learns that he can always come back to God. Larry then pulls out his fathers toy chameleon which eyes start falling off.
