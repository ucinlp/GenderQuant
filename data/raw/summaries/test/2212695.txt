Alice  offends her would-be lover William  by rejecting his advances. Upset, she falls asleep reading Alice in Wonderland. The white rabbit  appears to her in a dream and takes her into a sexual wonderland. The story loosely follows Carroll's original plot, and includes many of his characters, but with considerable sexual license.
