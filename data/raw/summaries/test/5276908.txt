Blanche is freshly installed in Cergy-Pontoise, a trendy new town near Paris. She has a new apartment, a new job with no one over and no one under her. She meets Léa at the swimming pool, and soon she meets an acquaintance of Léa, Alexandre, who she approaches somewhat awkwardly. The movie then follows the time-honored plot of exchange of relationships, as Blanche and Lea switch boyfriends. the name L'ami de mon amie would then literally mean the friend of my friend or perhaps the boyfriend of my girlfriend, ami meaning friend, boyfriend in this case, and amie being the female of the word ami with the same general and intended meanings.
