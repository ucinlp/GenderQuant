The film revolves around a business meeting at a restaurant between frustrated screenwriter Byron , hack director Larry ([[Larry Thomas , and clueless producer James . Byron struggles in vain to stick to his original vision for a film while Larry and James are intent on altering the script. Aside from their wishing to make money, they also want to create a film that will "make the audience walk out...in a good way!" Their shocking movie is tentatively titled "The Umpire Strikes Back", due to the "created" narrative revolving around a baseball ump  who goes on a killing spree which includes a rip off of the iconic black and white shower scene from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, but with a bat replacing the infamous knife. The script alterations, as well as the trio's recollections of past ventures, are portrayed in short skits and interspersed scenes with the restaurant setting throughout. Many of these cutaway scenes feature the bickering, and at times ageously violent, cop duo Hines  and Sterns  who are trying to find the killer ump. Cutaways also feature appearances by Edward Asner as a prospective investor not impressed with James' proposal, Erin Moran as a women's apparel store owner who is not impressed with James' merchandising plan, Robert Z'Dar as an actor auditioning for the role of the killer, and Lloyd Kaufman as a victim from a previous feature from the trio. In the restaurant, waitress and struggling actress Holly , at the urging of her pushy fellow waitress friend Kari , tries repeatedly to get the trio's attention to cast her in one of their projects. She is finally able to reach Byron after he takes a break at the bar to 'get numb'. Byron alludes to her that she will not be taken seriously if they put her in one of their movies. Holly however is at a breaking point and insists she if willing to take the risk no matter what, but Byron still resists. The film concludes with Byron deciding to strike out on his own and 'do something he's proud of for a change'. He gives Holly his card and heads out.
