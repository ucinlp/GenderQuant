Peter is a boy who is always maltreated by his father because of his homosexuality. He decided to run away and was found by a wealthy lady, Doña Biday, and is adopted by her. But he becomes abusive of his new found wealth, and after the death of Doña Biday he becomes more abusive of his wealth and mistreated most of his housemaids, employees, and friends. Because of that, he was given a curse that transforms him into a horse every time he gets angry, or does/says anything bad to others.
