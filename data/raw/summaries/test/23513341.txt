Five years ago, Jennifer Hills  was brutally raped by four men, after two weeks of recovery Jennifer gets revenge and brutally kills them. Jennifer was never charged for the crime and claimed she did not kill in self-defense but in retribution. Now, Jennifer is in law school and decides to skip her final exam with her friend Sam  to a secluded cottage. Jennifer and Sam stop at a gas station where Sam befriends a local man, Dwayne Chesney  and Tommy . Later that day Sam wanders off and is then raped and killed by Dwayne and Tommy. Worried, Jennifer searches for Sam and finds Dwayne, who claims to know where Sam is. Jennifer is then brought back to Dwayne's cottage where she finds Sam dead. Jennifer then attempts to escape. Before she can get away, however, the two men rape her in the woods and then stab her, leaving her for dead. Jennifer survives and, once again, seeks revenge. She finds Dwayne and chases him through the woods, sawing his head in half with a chainsaw when she catches him. She finds Tommy at Dwayne's cottage treating Sam's body as if it was still alive, where he is interrupted by Jennifer. Tommy tries to run off but Jennifer threatens him with a rifle. Tommy then tries to convince Jennifer not to kill him. Unmoved, Jennifer shoots Tommy in the testicles and walks off, leaving Tommy for dead like Dwayne and Tommy did to her.
