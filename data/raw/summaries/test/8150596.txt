A teenaged son has run away from home. His father is ineffective at finding him, so his mother contacts two former lovers from around the time her son was conceived, telling them both that the child is their son and asking them to look for him. One of them  is a tough journalist investigating the Mafia, while the other  is a timid former teacher who was on the verge of committing suicide when he received the telephone call. The two former boyfriends finally meet, and together they locate the son. They both argue who is really the father. In the end the son tells both Depardieu and Richard  that his mother thinks that he is the father. Thus, the son adopts both of them as his fathers, and also reconciles with his real father.
