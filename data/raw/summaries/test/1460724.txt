Although Karan and Kishan have been friends for years, they have grown apart and have little in common. The widower Karan is a poor mechanic who lives in a humble house in the countryside. Kishan is a rich man with a vast business empire and little time for old friends. However, when Karan prepares to work abroad and earn more money, he turns to Kishan to solve a problem. Will Kishan let Karan's daughter Suman  stay at his house? Kishan cannot turn down his old friend's request and Suman comes to live with his family. At first, country girl Suman is ill at ease in the huge mansion. She is befriended by Kishan's son Prem , who assures her that he has no romantic interest in her and that a boy and a girl can be platonic friends. The pair share outings and confidences and all seems to be going well. Then Prem takes Suman to a party, organized by some of his rich friends. They humiliate Suman and accuse her of scheming to marry Prem. Suman leaves in tears and distances herself from Prem. At that point, Prem suddenly realizes that he has fallen in love with her. With the aid of his mother  and his comic friend Manohar, Prem sets out to win Suman's heart. He succeeds, but Kishan balks at the romance, as he does not want his son to marry a poor nobody. He prepares to send Suman home in disgrace. At this unfortunate moment, Karan returns from overseas. Kishan accuses him of plotting to match Prem and Suman. Karan and Kishan quarrel, and Karan and Suman return to their village humiliated. Prem refuses to accept the separation. He defies his father and is disinherited. He goes to Suman's village and begs to be allowed to marry her. Karan, angered by Kishan's accusations, says that he will allow the marriage on one condition: Prem must prove that he can support his wife by his own efforts. Prem then works as a truck driver and laborer in the nearby quarry. At the end of the month, when Prem is ready with the required money and comes to win over his lady's father, he is ambushed by his enemies. They nearly succeed in killing him, but he survives. Karan harshly dismisses Prem's efforts, but his stoic determination melts Karan's heart, and he agrees to let Suman marry Prem. By the end of the movie, the estrangement between Karan and Kishan has ended, too. Prem and Suman live happily ever after.
