The story is based around young struggling actors  cohabiting an apartment to make ends meet. This scenario is pretty daring considering the conservative and censorious attitudes of that period. The landlady provides a play to the actors which turns out to be left behind long ago by a former destitute tenant  but now a successful theater producer and playwright who has recently taken a room in his old haunts to recharge his creativity and try to rewrite his first play which the landlady had kept when he was evicted. The young actors attempt to sell his own play to him. Complications are made by Cousin Muriel  visiting and discovering the sinful cohabitation and tattling to her folks who charge over to investigate and drag the daughters home. Silliness and mayhem ensues propelled by Muriel's actions highlighted by her unique little girl tattletale voice.
