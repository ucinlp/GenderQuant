In 1914, American showgirl "Suzy" Trent  is in London, looking for romance and meets and marries Irish engineer and inventor Terry Moore . The couple stumble on a German plot and her husband is shot by Madame Diane Eyrelle , a mysterious spy. Fearing she will be implicated in Terry's death, Suzy flees to Paris as World War I begins. In the cabaret where she works, Suzy meets famed French ace Capt. Andre Charville  who immediately falls in love with her. Their sudden marriage is not welcomed at first by his aristocratic father, Baron Edward Charville  but Suzy cares for him as her husband goes to the front. After he is wounded, Suzy goes to his side but finds that her first husband who survived his shooting, is delivering new British fighters to Andre's squadron. She also discovers Andre has been unfaithful and the beautiful woman who has been caring for him was the German spy she saw in London. In a confrontation with the spy and her henchman, Andre is killed but Terry flies his dangerous mission, taking revenge on the spy and the German fighters who had planned to ambush Andre. His crash landing back at the spy's chateau ends with Andre's dead body being placed next to his aircraft. At the funeral that follows, even German flyers pay homage and Terry is ordered to see the ace's widow back home to Paris.
