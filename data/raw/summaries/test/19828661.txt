Froggy and his parents enjoy a Red Skelton USO performance over the radio. Learning from his father that comedians make "a lot of money," Froggy decides that he and the gang should become radio comedians. They buy a joke book from a local used bookstore, and crash the lobby of a local dentists' office looking for a sponsor. The gang's horrible jokes and worse singing cause the waiting dental patients pain and distress, leading to their being thrown off the premises. Returning to the bookstore to look for another joke book, one of the bookstore patrons, a ham actor, convinces the kids to go into Shakespearean drama instead of comedy. Donning appropriate costumes, the gang attempts to audition their "sad and tragic" Shakespearean radio act for another potential sponsor, a funeral home, but the triplet owners of the company fall over themselves laughing at the gang's "dramatic" acting. On their way home, the crestfallen kids happen upon the host of the Cantfall Cake Hour radio show, who is interviewing passersby on the street. Amused by the children's costumes, he decides to ask the kids his interview question for the day: "what do you think is the crying need of radio today?" The gang's reply: "a sponsor!"
