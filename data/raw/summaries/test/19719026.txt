In the protagonist role, Yvette Lu is "Sheenyana," a beautiful, mystic warrior and member of the fictional Kyontawa tribe—a post-Neolithic tribe of humans residing on a pristine forested world, presumably in the Alpha Centauri star system.During dialog, Dr. Denise Hanson, a character in the film, mentions that they have landed over four light-years from Earth. Alpha Centauri is approximately that same distance from Earth. In the story, the Kyontawa are the descendents of a highly advanced Asian civilization from Earth's forgotten history, which established a deep-space settlement on what is now Sheenyana's planet. Clearly, that high-tech civilization is no more and the Kyontawa's knowledge of it is limited to their religious mythology of "Bird Gods" who seeded their people from the sky. Their language  has similarities to Asian languages of Earth, particularly Japanese. After a NASA expedition lands in Sheenyana’s forest, Sheenyana saves the life of American astronaut Lt. Richard O’Conner . Their connection is immediate and, before long, the two fall into a forbidden affair—the foundation of a cultural clash which will threaten to rip them apart. When Sheenyana’s psychic visions foretell a coming danger from Earth, they lead her to the anguishing conclusion that the only way to save her people may be to sacrifice an innocent man—and the love of her life.
