The story takes place at Bunker Hill, a highly prestigious military academy with a proud tradition of training young men for college and military service. On the eve of the graduation parade, Brian Moreland meets privately with the academy commander, retired Brigadier General Harlan Bache, who promotes him to Cadet Major, the highest cadet rank in the academy. Brian is well-liked and respected by almost everyone, especially his fellow officers Cadet Captain Alex Dwyer and Cadet 1st Lieutenant Edward West. The next day at the parade, General Bache announces that the school's board of trustees has decided to sell the school to real estate developers, but that they will remain open for one more year, giving many at Bunker Hill hope that the school can be saved. A dance is held at the academy after commencement. As the cadets arrive with their dates, a group of local teenagers outside the gates harass them verbally. A brawl breaks out when Moreland tries to take control of the situation, and when General Bache follows him and attempts to end the fight, his service pistol is seized by one of the local boys and goes off. One of the townies is killed, and Bache is arrested. Before he can be charged with manslaughter, the cadets find out that Bache has suffered a heart attack and is in critical condition at a local hospital. In the wake of the incident, the board decides to close the school immediately. Cadet Major Moreland meets with his officers and they unanimously decide to take control of the campus. When the Dean of Students arrives with the local sheriff to empty the armory the weapons are already gone, and they are met by Moreland and a cadre of armed cadets. The cadets demand that they be allowed to meet with General Bache and negotiate with the board of trustees to keep the school open. The school staff and the sheriff are escorted to a school bus and allowed to leave, since Moreland refuses to hold them as hostages, and armed cadets secure the perimeter against any attempt to retake the campus in the meantime. Another group of cadets have been sent to a local food supply warehouse to restock their provisions but one of their trucks breaks down on the way back. As Cadet Captain Dwyer attempts to fix the engine, a group of townies threatens them with another fight until hotheaded Cadet Captain David Shawn opens fire with his M16, shooting several bursts into the air. The townies scatter and the cadets abandon the stalled truck, fleeing the scene in the second truck and ramming a police car in the process. The police surround the campus, but Moreland maintains order and initially morale is high. A delegation of parents soon arrives, led by Brian's father, an Army Master Sergeant, who tries to save face by telling Brian that he's made his point and it's time to end the standoff. The two argue, and after his father slaps him, Moreland orders the delegation escorted from the campus. To demonstrate to the police and parents that none of the boys are being held against their will, Moreland assembles the cadets and offers them a chance to walk out. All of them choose to stay. The siege grows more tense when the National Guard arrives. The commander, Colonel Kerby, negotiates with Cadet Major Moreland with greater diplomacy and patience than his father had, but with no more success. Although Kerby admits to Moreland he admires an institution like Bunker Hill, he explains that he is accountable to the state legislature, which has been inundated with complaints and fears from locals and parents. At the next morning muster the officers report that eleven cadets have climbed the walls overnight to return home. Moreland assembles the entire battalion and again offers any cadets who wish the opportunity to leave the campus. At least half of the remaining cadets drop their weapons and walk out, including Moreland’s friend Lieutenant Edward West. As the siege continues, food is running out and the water is turned off. When the electricity is turned off, one of the cadets is severely burned as they attempt to restart the school's old gasoline powered generator. They permit an ambulance to enter and take the injured boy to a hospital, and afterwards, Moreland offers to stand down if the order comes from General Bache. Kerby replies that Bache had died the previous night. The cadets, deeply hurt by Bache's death, hold a military memorial service in his honor. One night, an M48 Patton tank rolls up to the main gate and scans the immediate area. One of the youngest cadets, on sentry duty near the gate, panics and runs out to surrender. He drops his weapon, which fires upon hitting the ground. Nervous National Guard soldiers open fire, killing the cadet's companion, Charlie Auden, who had tried to go after him. Charlie's death weakens Moreland’s resolve considerably and, after conferring with Dwyer, he decides to end the occupation. He calls all the cadets to muster and orders them to surrender. But the rebellious David Shawn starts shooting and firefight ensues. Dwyer and Moreland run to Shawn's room, hoping to stop him, as police and National Guard invade the grounds. Shawn and Moreland are killed by suppressing fire from the Patton tank, and the fight ends abruptly as Colonel Kerby takes command of the campus. Accompanied by a saddened Colonel Kerby, Dwyer carries Moreland's body out of the school, followed by the surviving cadets, as well as the National Guardsmen, Army and local law enforcement personnel. Last, we see a flashback of prouder times at Bunker Hill as General Bache reviews a parade of cadets.
