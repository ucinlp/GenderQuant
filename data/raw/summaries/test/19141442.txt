Paw Hee-Ching and Leung Chun-lung plays a mother and son who live in Tin Shui Wai. Paw works in the local supermarket while Leung is a Form 5  student who is waiting for his HKCEE results during summer holidays. Paw met Chan Lai-wun as she also becomes one of the supermarket staff and begins to help her out. Chan wants to buy a television set but is turned off by the transport fee. Paw asks Leung to come to the electrical store and helps her carry it up to her public housing apartment and saves the transport fee. She returns the favour by giving Paw a bag of expensive Chinese mushrooms. Paw's mother falls sick and Leung visits her in the hospital with his cousin. Their grandmother demands swallow's nest porridge for her meals which is not fulfilled. Through her deceased daughter, Chan has a grandson who lives with her son-in-law, who has since re-married. Chan purchased gifts for them and goes with Paw to meet them in Shatin, but her grandson does not show up and her gifts are rejected by her son-in-law. She gives them to Paw instead, who agrees to safekeep them for the time being. Leung meets his school teacher  and she invites him to help out at the school when he returns for F6 and he duly agrees. Paw's two younger brothers are doing well in life, thanks to Paw's financial support during their university years overseas. One of them, played by Clifton Ko, talks to Leung and said he and his younger brother will support him financially to study overseas if he so desires. He replies that he will decide after seeing his HKCEE results. At the end of the movie, Paw, Leung and Chan are seen happily having dinner together in Tin Shui Wai as Leung got satisfactory results in his exam and got promoted to F6.
