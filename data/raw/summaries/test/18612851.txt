Suneo shows everyone a fossil of a dinosaur claw and Nobita is angry that he doesn't get a look. Nobita claims that he will be able to find a living dinosaur. Panicking, Nobita researches on dinosaurs and starts digging in a hill. But then, a landlord shouts at him and makes him dig a hole in the ground. Nobita unearths a ball of soil, shaped like an egg. Using time wrap, he returns the soil into its former form and plans to hatch the egg. A dinosaur with a long neck comes out, and Nobita decides to name the dinosaur Piisuke. Suneo and Gian look for him but because Piisuke is too small, Nobita doesn't show them and instead makes a deal with them. If he cannot show them a real dinosaur, he would have to eat spaghetti through his nose. Piisuke grows too big and has to retire to a lake. He is seen and before Nobita has a chance to show Gian and Suneo, he is forced to take Pisuke back to his home. Gian and Suneo chase after Nobita and even Shizuka doesn't believe him. Angry, he begs Doraemon to show Piisuke to them and realize that the dinosaur is in danger, as they brought him to the wrong place. They run to the time machine to fetch him. The time machine breaks and so, they use the copter to travel, day and night. Then, they are cornered by dinosaur hunters from the future, who want to take Piisuke from him. They say they will consider it and during the night, they make clay figures of themselves, put into clay cars controlled by a remote. The next day, their plan is discovered, Shizuka, Gian and Suneo are captured. Doraemon and Nobita rush to save them and all five have to face being eaten by a ferocious Tyrannosaurus rex. As he nears, they realize that this was one of the tame dinosaurs and chase the hunters with the dinosaur. Shizuka, Suneo and Gian run into police, who put the dinosaur hunters in prison. Pisuke is taken to his home and all five of them go home.
