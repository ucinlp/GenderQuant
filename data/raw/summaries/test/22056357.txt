Jack Dobson, a homicide detective from Palm Beach, is flat on his back with a bullet in his chest. He has a flashback to the events that led him to this fate. Dobson has been receiving threatening letters. He and partner Steve Frayn conclude that the source must be a mob figure Dobson is about to testify against in court. But another possibility is that someone could be causing trouble for Dobson's brother, Michael, who is in an election campaign for public office. Women begin turning up dead, with lipstick traces left by the killer. A woman Dobson has begun seeing, Ellen, could be involved. But when she sees Dobson leave a restaurant with a woman who soon becomes a victim, suspicion is cast toward Dobson himself as the killer.
