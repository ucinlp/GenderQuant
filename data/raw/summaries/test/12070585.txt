Although technically a Spaghetti Western, the plot of Texas, Adios plays more like a traditional American western film. Franco Nero plays two-fisted, taciturn Texas sheriff, Burt Sullivan, a man committed to duty and justice but possessed by a desire for revenge. Sullivan, along with his younger brother, crosses the border to bring wealthy and sadistic Mexican crime boss Cisco Delgado  to justice for the murder of their father. Eventually joining forces with a group of Mexican revolutionaries, Sullivan and his brother soon find themselves at the center of a bloodbath.
