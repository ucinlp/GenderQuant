Australian Stephen Manners  travels to New Zealand and falls in love with a Māori girl. He goes home and she dies giving birth to their daughter, Iwa. Iwa is raised by her grandfather Hauraki , who explains to Manners what happens when he returns to New Zealand twenty years later. Manners decides to take Iwa  back to Sydney, Australia, but doesn't tell her that he is her father. Travelling with Manners is John Barris , who Hauraki tells on his deathbed that Iwa's real father actually is a missionary, not Manners. Barris keeps this information to himself and makes advances on Iwa, which are stopped by Manners. Iwa tells Manners she is in love with him, so Manner explains he is her father and she returns to Rotarua. Barris' wife  tells Manners the truth so he returns to New Zealand and is reunited with Iwa, this time as a romantic couple.{{cite news}}
