José Miguel García, a thirty-seven years old radio announcer, has achieved professional success with his late-night radio show Solos en la madrugada  which is devoted to criticizing the regime of the dictator Francisco Franco.The program has achieved the highest audience in the country. The space, full of irony, is directed to those men and women born during the Spanish civil war or in the years immediately after, whom he accuses of cowardice and failing in a life burdened by the past. The journalist pessimistic point of views are a reflection of the dissatisfaction he faces in his own life. José Miguel is separated from his wife, Elena, with whom he has two children, whom he rarely sees. During this period of his life comes the opportunity to begin a new life with a girl named Maite, who belongs to a generation of war and the postwar period.
