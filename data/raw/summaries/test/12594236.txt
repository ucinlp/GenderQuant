Daffy Duck, here a horror fanatic, is reading a scary comic book called "Hideous Tales" . The comic's "Noseman" story ends in a cliffhanger, and Daffy rifles his bookcase looking for the next issue . While doing so however, a monster clock falls and beans Daffy, knocking him out. This causes him to have a dream where he's the featured act in a nightclub. All the customers at the nightclub are classic movie monsters. Daffy appears unable to sing, but fortunately there was a bottle of "Eau de Tormé" in Daffy's dressing room, which makes him sing like Mel Tormé. After drinking the spray's entire contents for maximum effect, he sings "Monsters Lead Such Interesting Lives" to the room, and they love it. Then he goes around the room, greeting the patrons, but his good-natured ribbing of "Smogzilla" doesn't go over well with the giant lizard , who eats Daffy. Daffy wakes up, to find himself stuck in a wastebasket, along with the comic he was looking for , with "Smogzilla" on the cover. Daffy scoffs, and the Smogzilla on the cover comes to life, saying, "You were expecting maybe Calvin Coolidge?"
