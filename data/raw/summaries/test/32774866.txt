One day in Hollywood, actors come to the studio to do their routines. Also coming to the studio is Beans who travels in his rough-riding car, but the guard will not permit him to enter. Not backing out, Beans disguises himself as Oliver Hardy, and passes through the gate without suspicion. Taking off his cover, Beans enters a sound stage where Oliver Owl is directing a film. Looking from a catwalk, Beans watches Little Kitty perform a scene where an actor tries to court her. Suddenly, he a passing worker accidentally knocks him off and Beans falls on top of the actor, much to the Oliver's annoyance, who tosses Beans away. Beans lands in a scene room where a Frankenstein-esque robot is on the table. As he frightenedly moves back, the cat lands on a switch. As a result, the robot activates and rises. The robot goes into a rampage and everyone flees the studio. Beans tries to whack it with an iron bar but the robot is very sturdy and throws him across the sound stage. As Beans lands next to a giant fan, he switches it on, generating a gale force at the robot. The robot resist the draft, but walks straight into the fan getting smashed to bits.
