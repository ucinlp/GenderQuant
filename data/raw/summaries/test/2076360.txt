I Love to Singa depicts the story of a young owlet who wants to sing jazz, instead of the classical music that his German parents wish him to perform. The plot is a light-hearted tribute to Al Jolson's film The Jazz Singer. The young owl, voiced by Tommy Bond, best known as "Butch" of the Our Gang films,{{bcdb}} is unjustly kicked out of his family's house by his disciplinarian violinist father  after he is caught singing jazz instead of "Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes" to the reed  organ accompaniment of his mother . While wandering, he comes across a radio amateur contest, hosted by "Jack Bunny" , and billing himself as "Owl Jolson" , wins the contest, but not before his father has finally seen his son's potential and allows him to freely sing jazz.
