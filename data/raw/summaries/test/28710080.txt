One day Shin Chan on his way back found a ball near a river and brought it home. Himawari saw that ball and swallowed it as she loves shining things. Later it was known that it was a mysterious ball that belonged to Devil Jack and two gangs for which they were fighting with each other for getting the ball. It was considered that they could win the world with that ball by releasing the Devil Jack. Himawari was kidnapped by the king Jed, but later she was released. Devil Jack was accidentally released by Shin Chan....... But to their shock jack wasn't evil anymore and didn't had his powers because he died and showed his expire date and said that the one who is alive is the best! Mitsy and Harry thought it was just a waste of time because the world wasn't going to be destroyed. Furious King Jed tried to fled by capturing Himawari. He said that he will throw her from the building if they tried to stop him. The clumsy female police officer Yone Higashimatsuyama tried to stop Jed by her poor marksmanship. But Then Shin Chan leaped on her and her shot hit the right spot. Jed threw Himawari and Shin Chan caught her and the rest of the good gang helped them to. And they saved Himawari. The police came and arrested the evil gang.Yone said that they were late and she already captured them in joy. In the end the Nohara Family returned home. Then Midori Yoshinaga ma'am came and asked why didn't Shin Chan came school for two days. Mitsy quickly gave Shin Chan's school clothes and said sorry can he change inside. Hiroshi was late for his office so asked can they give him a ride. When the bus strode away Shiro came home and Mitsy told them that he would be hungry. In the bus Ume Matsuzaka was late to and nene said that adults can do anything they want. Kazama and the rest of the friends asked Shin Chan where did he go and he simply replies that he was busy saving the world.
