In the 19th century, a zamindar  insults Goddess Durga by stealing her idol from a temple in a state of intoxication. An enraged Goddess kills him and casts a curse on his heirs that she is going to take one family member every 48 years as a sacrifice. As the curse said, one male heir dies accidentally at the end of every 48 years. The present year denotes end of another 48 years and now it's the turn of Murari . One day, Murari travels to his native village with his mother, where he meets Vasundhara . Vasundhara's family is related to Murari's family by his mother, but are separated due to family feuds. They both fall in love and both of their families make formal arrangements for marriage. However, her grandmother Sabari , returning from a pilgrimage, does not accept the marriage after getting informed of Murari's curse. Later on, she reveals the dark secret that is kept under wraps, and that the curse can be stopped only if a ritual is performed by Murari himself. Murari decides to bring Vasundhara back and marry her after performing the rituals, but is instead stabbed by his relative. Seeing this, Vasundhara loses her consciousness. Murari, in immense pain, manages to take Vasundhara and himself back to the temple, and performs the rituals. However, as the rituals are about to end, he succumbs to his wounds. Seeing this, Sabari drowns herself as a sacrifice to give back Murari's life. Murari revives and marries Vasundhara in the end.
