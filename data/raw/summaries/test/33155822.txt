Using a half road-movie, half documentary style, the film presents work and life of a Cuban band living in Guantanamo, Cuba. The film contains many music clips with well-done subtitles, as well as rehearsal work or live acts. In interview parts the musicians also explain how they develop their song concepts out of difficulties of daily life.
