In Tom and Jerry's penthouse apartment room around 10:00 PM, Tom finishes reading a book and prepares to sleep, setting his alarm clock to ring in the morning. However, this is also time for Jerry to get up. The mouse's alarm-watch rings and Jerry showers  and grooms himself before setting out for a tiny elevator in the wall. He hears Tom snoring and stops briefly before he enters the elevator and descends to a nightclub with a sign that says "Le Cellar Smoqu√©"  displayed at its entrance.  Jerry arrives at the bar and has a martini . Then, Jerry begins playing drums with a band, which puts the club into full swing! Shortly afterward, being woken up by the noise, Tom opens the elevator, to get blasted at by the loud music. He tries to block the elevator doors with a pillow, but it's not enough to stop the noise. He lowers a hose into the elevator shaft in hopes of drowning out the noise. His smug laughter is interrupted by a large dog (originally [[Spike and Tyke , who drags Tom downstairs and throws him into his flooded apartment room. Dripping wet, Tom goes back to his own apartment room, and then decides to stop the noise at its source, by grabbing some tools and heading down to the basement through the air vents. Hearing the music through the floor, Tom saws a hole in the floor and uses the plunger, but the music is coming from a radio, and to make matters worse, the large dog  pulls Tom up through the floor and punches him back up to his apartment room through the floors and his bed. Now, completely bruised and sleep deprived, Tom cries over this and puts corks in his ears, wraps up his head with bandages and tries to settle down to sleep. Thankfully, the music stops, causing Tom to wake up with a start, lose the bandages, and pop the corks. Then a tired Jerry is seen leaving the elevator toward his hole. Tom gleefully goes back to sleep, only to be awoken seconds later by his alarm clock, then, however, having been woken up by the noise, Jerry turns on the light in his mousehole, peeks out, and makes a shushing noise at Tom, but this action from Jerry immediately causes Tom to scream  and run straight out through the wall, leaving his outline behind, and Jerry just shrugs this off, thinking Tom's gone bonkers, imitates Charlie Chaplin's silent film walk while going back to bed, and the cartoon ends.
