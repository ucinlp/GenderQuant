{{plot}} The movie begins with a song by a virtual unusual band—consisting of a bag of popcorn, a hot dog, a chocolate Popsicle and a cup of soda—in a parody of the 1953 short film Let's All Go to the Lobby, only to be interrupted by heavy metal band Mastodon—animated as a gum drop, a pretzel, a box of Ice Caps, and a box of nachos—who warn the audience that bad movie etiquette will result in severe bodily harm or death. The movie proper begins in Egypt, where Master Shake, Frylock and Meatwad escape from the Sphinx , and are attacked by an oversized Poodle who kills Frylock before being destroyed by Shake. Shake and Meatwad flee with Frylock's corpse and meet Time Lincoln, who revives Frylock; however, when government agents break into his house, the Aqua Teens flee in his wooden rocket ship, and Time Lincoln is shot, changing the timeline and effectively resulting in white people being enslaved by black people. This, however, is all revealed to be an elaborate story concocted by Shake to explain their origin to Meatwad and Frylock. An animated music video then follows. Shake heads off to work out on his new exercise machine, the Insanoflex. Upon discovering that the machine is not assembled correctly , Frylock searches online for them. He finds a website written in a rare robot dialect with the only words in English warning not to assemble it...ever. The site then lists a phone number which Frylock calls. The film cuts to outer space on board the Plutonians Emory and Oglethorpe's ship. Before they even bother to answer the phone , the Plutonians discover the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future on board with them. The Cybernetic Ghost begins explaining to the two aliens the story of the Insanoflex: the machine, when assembled, will exercise a man into a super-being, who will attract all the women on Earth leading to massive inbreeding and the eventual extinction of mankind. To prevent this, the Ghost has traveled into the past and stolen a single screw that holds all the parts together. The Plutonians point out to him that to get it assembled, someone could just buy another screw or shove a pencil in the screw hole. Back on Earth, Frylock finishes building the machine , having just shoved a pencil in the screw hole. Before Shake can work out however, they discover a missing M-shaped circuit board on the back panel. The trio visit Carl, from whom Shake had stolen the machine, to see if he has the missing piece. After he refuses to tell them, Meatwad finds the address in the Insanoflex's box. Meanwhile, a triangular slice of watermelon named "Walter Melon", is flying about in a space ship made from a hollowed-out watermelon, observing the events unfolding according to his plan – Walter Melon is joined in the ship by Neil Peart from Rush, sitting at his drums. Dr. Weird, whose abandoned insane asylum has been purchased and is being turned into condominiums around them, is visited by Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad, who retrieve the missing piece and head home. Frylock installs the missing circuit board, but Carl insists that as the rightful owner he should be the first to test out the machine. The machine straps him in and elaborately transforms itself into a huge one-eyed robot. The robot plays dance/techno music and begins stomping around, crushing houses and heading toward downtown Philadelphia, all while Carl's strapped-in form is forced to exercise. Eventually, the robot begins laying large metallic eggs, which hatch into smaller versions of the machine. The Aqua Teens, aided by an instructional workout video, find a way to destroy the machine. Meatwad gets MC Pee Pants  to help, but he is hit with a flyswatter by Shake while giving a demonstration. With little time, the Aqua Teens have no choice but to have Shake play a new song with his guitar. Shake plays his original song "Nude Love" on acoustic guitar, forcing the machine to commit suicide because Shake's song is so bad. Carl  leaves with his date, a muscular woman named Linda, and they head back to her condo while the Aqua Teens try to figure out a way to stop the newly-hatched smaller robots from destroying the city. Meanwhile, Frylock begins to tell the origin story of the Aqua Teens: they were created by Dr. Weird, along with a chicken nugget who had gone by the name of Chicken Bittle. In the flashback, Dr. Weird proclaims that the Aqua Teens were created for one purpose, and one purpose only: to crash a jet into a brick wall. Realizing the pointlessness of this mission, Frylock simply diverted the jet  and set a course to Africa, where they would try to use their intelligence to solve world hunger. While parachuting down to the earth, Bittle was attacked and eaten by a lion. The remaining three then tried to help a small village, but the natives feared them and ran away. After realizing they couldn't be much help, they hopped back in the jet and rented out what is now their house in New Jersey. Shake and Meatwad state that they cannot remember any of this, but Frylock explains it was because they were too busy playing their Game Boy to pay any attention. Meanwhile, Carl and the muscular woman Linda recline in her room, where she reveals "herself" to be Dr. Weird in disguise. He cuts off Carl's muscles with a hunting knife and grafts them onto his own body. Frylock and Dr. Weird do battle, and the struggle continues while they argue back and forth about who created whom. Dr. Weird claims that it was Frylock who created him, not the other way around. Dr. Weird then reveals that the blue diamond on Frylock's back hides a VCR, in which a video with false memories of Dr. Weird creating Frylock had been playing in Frylock's head. Frylock also admits that he is transsexual lesbian trapped in a man's body. Just then, Walter Melon arrives in his ship and explains he created the Aqua Teens and all the other characters so that they would eventually kill each other, after which Walter would inherit all their real estate in order to create the "Insano-Gym." The other characters, however, inform Walter that they all rent and do not own any property, not only rendering Walter's plan completely useless, but proving that everyone's existence is completely pointless. Walter storms off in his ship, threatening to tell their mother about their failures. Just then, the Teens' see their alleged mother standing before him, revealed to be a 9-layer bean burrito. The Soda Dog Refreshment comes onscreen once again and dismisses the audience. After the credits, there is a quick scene of the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future humping the television in the Aqua Teen's living room. The camera then pans left to Frylock who now has large breasts, primped hair, and is dressed in feminine clothing, indicating that Frylock got a sex change.
