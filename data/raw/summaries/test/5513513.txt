Bingo is an outcast circus dog whom his owners pay little attention to. Their star puppy, Lauren, develops an infection so they use Bingo for their next act - The Ring of Fire. But Bingo is afraid of fire  and chickens out. His master  gets ready to kill him, but his wife stops him and tells Bingo to start over and find a family. Bingo does so when the master's wife finally agrees to kill him. The next day, Chuckie and his friends  go for a bike ride but Chuckie is too slow. To prove to his friends that he isn't scared, he attempts to jump a bridge  but nearly kills himself in the process. Bingo sees the whole thing and jumps on Chuckie's stomach to get the water out of him. The next day after that, Chuckie wakes up to find himself naked and all his clothes have been hung up on the washing line . He eventually finds Bingo and thanks him for saving his life, and that they'll be friends for life. Bingo finds a fish for Chuckie to eat but encounter a bear in the process. Meanwhile Chuckie's parents  worry over their son. But the next morning, when Chuckie does return, they don't want to know where he was, instead telling him to take a shower as he smells like "wet dog". Chuckie has to leave for school but when he comes home Bingo pees up the tree (as if the waterbed earlier made him need to go. After that, the two spend more time together  but Bingo causes trouble as well . Chuckie returns home and his best friend is largely blamed for the incidents. Hal tells him to go upstairs and start packing as he has been traded to a new team, the stupid Green Bay Packers. Chuckie makes a death-proof box for Bingo to sleep in so he can take him with him. But Bingo sneaks out in the middle of the night and goes to see next-door's dog  with flowers and a bottle of champagne. But he misses Chuckie's car as it drives of their new home. Chasing the car, Chuckie's parents spot him, and they drive away. Bingo then gets into an encounter with a policeman, who believes he has been drinking. After escaping, he punishes a dog-killer and his wife by driving a truck into their shack. Then Bingo suspects two henchmen, Lenny and Eli, attempting to kill a lovable family. The next day, both men are sentenced to jail and Bingo is taking in by two deranged dog-loving girls. The CID come round and take Bingo to court, where he is found guilty and took to jail. This has been approved by VSC.
