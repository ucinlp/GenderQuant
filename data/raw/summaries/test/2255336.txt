Chris Hunter stabs a man in her home one night while her husband Bob is out of town. The dead man's name is Tanner and she claims not to know him. A blackmailer, Martin Barrow, shows up with a bust of Chris Hunter's head signed by Tanner, who was a sculptor. Larry Hannaford, her lawyer and a good friend, realizes that Chris is lying about not knowing the man she killed. Barrow double-crosses her by taking the artwork to Tanner's wife, who is now convinced Chris had an affair with her husband. She relays this information to Bob Hunter, who demands a divorce after Chris admits having an affair with Tanner while her husband was away during the war. Chris is charged with murder and tried. Hannaford persuades the jury that while Chris was indeed guilty of adultery, she stabbed Tanner in self-defense.
