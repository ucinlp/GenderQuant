This story shows that gender and social/sexual roles can be more apparent than real, even for 19th century Dublin, Ireland. Besides the film's main plot of women "crossing over" to live socially as men , the opening of the film shows a scene of two male-female couples arriving noisily late at night to the hotel, but afterwards a followup scene shows that the two men had actually spent the night together in bed, with their female "dates" nowhere to be seen. Albert Nobbs  is a woman living as a man in order to find work in the harsh environment of 19th-century Ireland. After living as a male for thirty years, Albert, working as a hotel waiter, is known for his extreme dedication to his job, as well as for a very introverted personality. Albert has been secretly saving all his earnings to buy a tobacco shop to gain some measure of freedom and independence. Albert's steadfast focus on this is shaken by the sudden arrival of Hubert Page , a house painter hired by Mrs. Baker , the hotel owner. Albert is shocked that Hubert is to room with him while he works at the hotel. On their first night, Hubert discovers Albert's secret, but promises never to reveal it, much to Albert's relief. The next day, Hubert confesses he is also a biological woman. Hubert leaves soon after, but not before telling Albert that he has a wife named Cathleen, a dressmaker. Meanwhile, recently unemployed Joe Mackins  arrives at the hotel to repair the boiler. Flirtatious maid, Helen Dawes , is attracted to him, and they soon become lovers; Joe's controlling nature and alcoholism soon become apparent, however. Albert visits Hubert at his home and meets Cathleen . Albert tells Hubert the story of his/her life: born a bastard and raised in a convent before being kicked out after her well to do mother's death. One night, when she was fourteen, she was brutally gang raped and beaten by a group of men. Immediately afterwards, in order to to find work she hears there is a need for waiters, so she buys a suit and is hired. This is a pivotal event because she chooses to continue to work and eventually live as a man. We are never told what name she was born with -- she thinks of herself solely as "Albert". Believing Helen may be the ideal wife to run a shop with, Albert asks her to leave with him. Helen refuses, but Joe, believing that Albert will give Helen money that could help the pair emigrate to America, encourages Helen to lead him on. Helen agrees to be with Albert, who buys Helen expensive gifts to please her. Helen is uncomfortable with Albert and the arrangement that Joe forced her to make. Albert tells Helen he wants to buy a shop, though Helen only wants to leave Ireland for America. A typhoid epidemic has broken out in Dublin, and when some staff fall ill, customers avoid the hotel, causing financial problems. Albert becomes infected but soon recovers, while Helen discovers she is pregnant with Joe's child. Joe is terrified, fearing he will become like his abusive father. Albert goes to Hubert's home and learns that Cathleen died, devastating Hubert. As a tribute to her, Albert and Hubert don dresses Cathleen made and take a stroll on the beach. Though both at first are extremely uncomfortable, in this isolated environment, if only for a brief moment, Albert is free enough to embrace her real identity and sexuality. This is an important scene in the film for while Hubert does not identify himself as a woman, even in private, Albert is overcome with joy at finding that he is still a woman, reveling in the person who has been sublimated for so many years. But a stumble and fall brings her back to reality and she and Hubert redress as men and go back to their lives as before. Back at the hotel, Albert learns Helen is pregnant and offers to marry her. Helen refuses, sensing Albert does not love her, though Albert agrees with her fear that Joe will abandon her and the child and go to America alone. Later that evening, when Joe and Helen get into a loud fight, Albert intervenes. Albert physically attacks Joe when he attempts to hurt Helen in a fit of rage; Joe throws Albert against a wall, hitting Albert's head. Albert returns to his room, but notices that he is bleeding from one ear. He dies later that night, presumably as a result of his head injury. Mrs. Baker discovers Albert's hidden money and uses it to revitalize the hotel. In the following months, Joe has gone to America and Helen has given birth to a son, Albert Joseph. Mrs. Baker makes further use of Albert's money by hiring Hubert to paint the entire hotel. Hubert sees Helen again, who breaks down and reveals that she will be separated from her son and thrown out into the street. Hubert tells her, "We can't let that happen, can we?", implying that he will look after her in lieu of Albert.
