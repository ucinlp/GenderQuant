A small Mexican hairless dog, wanting to be friends with the other dogs on Park Avenue, decides to borrow a fur coat and enter the dog show. Unfortunately, she borrows a skunk pelt by accident and frightens the other dogs. She soon cries that nobody loves her, and soon attracts the unwanted attentions of the amorous Pepé Le Pew. After he corners her in his house, she finally removes the pelt and Pepé reveals he's wearing a mask, showing that he's a dog and the two embrace. Another mask removal proves Pepé is indeed a skunk who doesn't care that his love interest is a dog.
