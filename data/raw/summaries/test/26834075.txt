Punaradhivasam movie narrates the tale of a few people whose minds need to be rehabilitated â€” a father and son who are not able to understand and love each other, and a lady who fails to love and get love from her husband. Another core character in the story is the daughter-in-law, who comes from a household where love and understanding are in abundance.
