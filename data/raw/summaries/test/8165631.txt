Azizah, a poor peasant, portrays worker oppression in this somber social drama. She gets savagely raped by a guard when she goes into the fields to gather potatoes. She does not reveal what had happened to her husband who is suffering from an illness. She conceals the pregnancy and throttles the baby after it is born. She also dies soon thereafter. The migrant workers rally around her memory as she becomes a martyr to the cause of the struggling peasants. The newspaper Le Monde wrote: "we have attracted to this movie due to the true picture that reflects the suffering of this village, the picture is not about a problem for one individual, itâ€™s about the reflection of everything surrounding her, from people to culture."
