Felix and a little black kitten are at the outdoors blowing bubbles. After blowing a few, Felix was asked by kitten to make one for the latter to ride in. Felix then makes the bubble, and the kitten starts to float away in it. Much to their surprise, the bubble was too difficult to burst, and Felix went on to chase his airborne companion for hundreds of miles. Finally the bubble reaches the Arctic and settles to the surface. Felix, at last, opens the sphere and frees the kitten. While they are travelling to get back home, darkness fell, and the two cats went separated without realizing. To deal with the situation, Felix blows lantern bubbles to brighten the place. The Arctic became a beautiful lighted paradise but a local bear doesn't appreciate it and therefore goes to confront Felix. To defend himself against the fearsome bruin, Felix shields himself in a bubble. The bear then pushes Felix's bubble into a hole in the ice cap where it sinks into the water. Once more, Felix felt he was untouchable until an eel was able to penetrate his protective orb. Although other eels went in and packed themselves in the bubble, Felix was able to slip out. He then carries the eel-filled bubble all the way home. Upon reaching a sea food store in a city, Felix sells the eels he has, and was paid a sack of cash. While celebrating his earnings, he suddenly remembers and begins to worry about his little buddy who is still missing. Lost at some wilderness, the kitten is weeping and doesn't know what to do. Felix then gives a loud call, and the little cat, though faraway, was able to hear it. The kitten eventually reaches the city and embraces Felix.
