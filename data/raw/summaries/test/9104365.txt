The story is about a Norwegian immigrant farmer in Wisconsin, Martinius Jacobson , his wife Bruna  and their seven-year-old daughter Selma , who is often bedeviled by her playmate and five-year-old cousin, Arnold . Martinius simply wants to work his land and be a loving farmer to his family. The one great ambition in the life of Martinius is to build a new barn, but tragedy strikes. How the family copes with that is the core and the charm of the film Selma lives a carefree, joyous life, which is only temporarily clouded by the sudden death of Ingeborg Jensen , an emotionally disturbed young woman whose stern father  had refused to let her attend school despite the pleas of newly arrived schoolmarm Viola Johnson . Inspired by young Selma, the entire town of Fuller Junction come to the aid of proud Bjorn Bjornson , who has lost his livestock when lightning struck and burned down his newly erected—but uninsured—barn. When Selma generously donates her pet calf to the impoverished farmer, the townspeople in general, and Martinius in particular, follow suit, prompting Viola to reconsider her harsh views of country life and retract her letter of resignation to the school board.Our Vines Have Tender Grapes at Allmovie
