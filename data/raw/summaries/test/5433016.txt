Akash "Akki" ([[John Abraham  and his wife Maya  are doctors. When malaria strikes India on the Burmese border, Maya rushes over to help, despite Akki's disapproval. Akash soon receives the news of her death caused by a bus crash. The bus crashed into water at heavy rains. Akash cannot accept Maya's passing away and believes strongly that she did not die. Akash himself has paranormal experiences where he feels that Maya's ghost is trying to communicate with him. He tries to communicate with her through the hospital patients who have suffered a near-death experience. Every patient draws a strange symbol, and one corpse starts talking to Akash when he is alone. Tanya , a close friend of Maya, tries to console Akash, because when her lover died in an accident it was Akash who treated her. Now, she believes it is her turn, and she believes he is hallucinating. With the help of a nun called Sister Martha and clues, Akash decides to go back to where it all began — the border. There, with the help of a guide, he tries to find out about Maya but it is not very successful, following which Akash jumps off a waterfall near the crash site and finds the sunken bus. He sees Maya's spirit beckoning him who shows him her accidents and incidents that follow. He goes to the nearby village tribe and asks if they saved Maya. They say she died, but they saved her soul. They take Akash inside and show him a surprise — though Maya died, while dying she gave birth to their daughter. Akash thus realises that Maya made him sure about trust because their baby survived among the tribe without any medical attention, despite being premature. He also realizes that Maya's ghost was trying to reach him so that he brings their daughter home. He takes their child home and lives happily ever after.
