Eye in the Sky takes place around the darker side of Hong Kong society, where the story begins with a group of organised burglars successfully robbing a jewelry store. The plot begins with the wet-behind-the-ears new recruit Piggy , who is plunged at the deep end in her first surveillance assignment working alongside her mentor, Sergeant Wong . Both of them work for the Hong Kong Police Force's Criminal Intelligence Bureau. After reviewing the jewelry store surveillance videos recordings, the Force attempt to track down one of the robbers by staking out the neighborhood they think he lives in. Fatman  is identified and tracked without his knowledge through a combination of tails, surveillance footage, and data-mining, including accessing his octopus card. The Force ambush is established at the scene of the next robbery, but the elusive Hollow Man  notices the police. As the robbers flee, some are killed by a Police Tactical Unit, but the rest escape. Chan kills an uniformed police officer as he flees, and Piggy stops to give first aid rather than continue the pursuit. The surveillance unit is then called to another case; a kidnapping. Piggy is staking out a phone booth where the kidnapper may make a call, when she sees Hollow Man go by. She recognises the kidnapper from Fatman's apartment building and allows the police to rescue the kidnap victim, while she pursues Hollow Man. After a tense confrontation in a cafe, where Hollow Man confronts her, she escapes suspicion, but Hollow Man notices Sergent Wong and stabs him in the neck with a pair of scissors. Wong convinces Piggy to continue to follow Hollow Man as he slowly bleeds to death. Piggy follows Wong to his hideout and calls for the Police Tactical Unit again. Meanwhile, Wong survives his injury and gets medical attention. In the raid on the hideout, Hollow Man flees down a dock and wounds himself mortally in the neck running past a hanging hook, and the other robbers were captured.
