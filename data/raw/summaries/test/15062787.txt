The title comes from the Book of Common Prayer: "From all the deceits of the world, the flesh, and the devil, spare us, good Lord." An intensely unhappy woman hatches a plot to switch the babies of a poor family and a rich family. But the nurse hired to pull off this transfer refuses to go through with it, leaving each baby with its proper family. When the babies are grown, the man from the poor family  goes to the house of the other and throws him out. The remainder of the movie deals with the frustrations of mistaken identity.
