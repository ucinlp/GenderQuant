In 2005, Katie delivers a box of old videotapes to her pregnant sister Kristi, and her husband Daniel. A year later, Kristi and Daniel's house is seemingly ransacked and the tapes are missing. In 1988, a young Katie and Kristi live with their mother Julie, and her boyfriend Dennis. Kristi begins interacting with an invisible friend named Toby. Dennis notices that since Kristi's friend appeared, strange things have been happening in the house. Dennis and Julie try to make a sex tape, but are interrupted by an earthquake. While they look for the girls, the camera shows dust fall from the ceiling and land onto an invisible figure in the room. While reviewing the footage, Dennis notices the strange incident. His friend Randy suggests that Dennis place cameras throughout the house to capture any other incidents. That night in the girls' bedroom, Kristi wakes up and talks to someone off-camera. When Dennis questions her the following day, Kristi tells him it was Toby. After more strange occurrences, Dennis discovers a strange symbol in the girls' closet. He finds the same symbol in a book about demonology. When Kristi falls ill, Julie and Dennis take her to the hospital. Katie is left with Randy, and they play Bloody Mary. They go into the girls' bathroom and say "Bloody Mary" three times and turn off the light. When nothing happens, Katie insists they try again. Randy is stricken with pain and camera lights reveal a large scratch up the side of his body. They try to leave the bathroom but a black figure moves past the door. When Randy tries to leave a second time, furniture is violently thrown around. After Julie and Dennis return, Randy hurriedly leaves. Dennis tells Julie that the symbol belonged to a witches' coven which brainwashed girls of child-bearing age into having sons, and then forced them to forget. Julie dismisses his claim. The invisible demon terrorizes Katie and Kristi, harming Katie and later dragging her into a closet in the girls' bedroom until Kristi agrees to do what it asks. The next day, Kristi asks her mother to take them to her grandmother Lois' home, but she refuses. After Julie encounters frightening activity herself, she agrees to go to Lois' home. Dennis sets up another camera in their new bedroom. At 1am, they are awoken by the sound of a car outside. After hearing more disturbances, Julie goes to investigate. When she fails to return, Dennis goes to look for her. He calls for Julie and the girls but there is no answer. Downstairs, Dennis notices a human silhouette behind a curtain, but when he looks behind the curtain he finds no one present. In the same room he finds strange imagery on the walls, including the symbol from the girls' room, which had been concealed behind framed paintings. Noticing that the backdoor is open, Dennis goes outside to investigate. He enters the garage and discovers several women, including Lois, all dressed in dark clothing. He flees back to the house, with the women in slow pursuit. In the house, he finds Julie at the top of the stairs. As he approaches, he sees that her limp body is levitating above the floor. Her body is thrown at Dennis, knocking him down the stairs. He gets up and sees Kristi, and then retreats with her into a closet. Something growls and bangs on the door but eventually leaves. Dennis and Kristi leave the closet. As they walk through the kitchen, Dennis sees the women outside in the garden, circling around a bonfire. As they move into the next room, they find Katie crying by the stairs a short distance away from Julie's body. He approaches Katie from behind, and places his hand on her shoulder. Katie turns and unleashes a demonic scream that throws him to the other side of the room, injuring his leg. Katie then runs away. Dennis tries to crawl toward Julie's body but Lois walks in front of him. Dennis's body is suddenly and violently contorted, snapping backwards and killing him. Katie goes to Lois, who beckons to Kristi. As they head upstairs, Kristi calls to Toby and the camera cuts to black.
