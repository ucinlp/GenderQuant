Being a movie that mix genres, The Ledge is part psychological drama, part philosophy debate, part thriller, and part love-story. The movie opens with detective Hollis Lucetti  receiving the news from a doctor that he has been sterile his entire life. Upon reaching home, he questions his wife about who their children's father is. The film quickly switches to Gavin Nichols , an atheist, standing on a ledge as if to jump to his death. A small crowd forms below Gavin and Hollis responds to the emergency. At first it looks like a regular suicide attempt. It is quickly revealed to be more complex than that, as Gavin explains to Hollis that he has no other choice than to jump, or somebody else will die. The movie then recounts the story of the love triangle between Gavin, Shana  and Joe ([[Patrick Wilson . Shana is the new girl at the hotel where Gavin works. Joe is Shana's husband. he is also a fundamentalist Christian. Gavin despises Joe, considering him a close-minded bigot who is unworthy of Shana's love. Joe, on the other hand, assumes that Gavin must be a coward since he doesn't believe in an afterlife. But is philosophy, beliefs and ethics the real issue between the three of them? Or are they merely covering up deeper emotional problems? Meanwhile, Gavin's roommate Chris is trying to get his relationship recognized by the religious organization where he and his boyfriend first met. This is separate from the main story, except that the animosity between Gavin and Joe begins with Joe mistaking Chris and Gavin for being a gay couple and calling them "abominable" over it. The premise is somewhat similar to that of a short story by Stephen King, also called "The Ledge".{{fact}}
