The film, set in a fictional high school, tells the story of a love triangle between Xandrie , and two step-brothers, Zack ([[Alex Russell  and Darren .{{Cite news}} The film begins with Zack and his friends, Brook and Jonathan, at the beach, where they presumably leave the unconscious Xandrie on the coast. Then it rewinds up to the events leading to that scene. Zack's step-brother, Darren, is the complete opposite of him. He likes to spend time in front of the computer, and he doesn't associate himself much with other people. He likes to swim, and is a part of Zack's swimming team, although he just swims because he likes it. A bubbly and intelligent girl, named Xandrie, takes a liking to him. To spend more time with Darren, she decides to attend one of Zack's extravagant house parties with her friend, Ella. Meanwhile, Zack's friends notice her infatuation with Darren, and Zack's interest on her. During the party, Xandrie fails to meet up with Darren; they were unable to find each other in the crowd. Zack's friends, Simone and Karenn, put something on Xandrie's drink and takes her and Ella in the basement, where Zack and his other friends are. Inside, Xandrie experiences the effects of the drug and subsequently falls out of consciousness, and Zack and his friends assault and rape her. Meanwhile, Darren, barred by Brook from following her, decides to go back to his room and falls asleep instead. Zack, Brook and Jonathan take Xandrie to the beach, and leaves her for dead. The next morning, Darren finds Xandrie's phone in the basement, and at school, he is unable to find her. Even Ella doesn't know where she is. Darren confronts Zack, who denies knowing where she is. Meanwhile, Darren hallucinates about Xandrie, regretting how he wasn't able to spend much time with her. Wanting answers, Darren questions Jonathan and beats him up, but he is unable to get answers from him. He tracks Xandrie's home address and visits her, but she isn't home. A few days pass, and Xandrie becomes the topic of negative rumors. But Xandrie returns, much to the surprise of everyone, especially Darren. While with Ella, Xandrie is approached by Karenn and Simone, with the former subtly warning her that it's only her word against theirs. Xandrie then subsequently remembers what happened after waking up at the beach. She went home and ignored Darren while he knocked on her home. Darren, still wanting to find out about what really happened, sneaks and downloads some files off of Jonathan's laptop. He finds out about what really happened, and dreams of killing those responsible. Darren finds time to see Xandrie, and offers her phone back, but she declines. Darren convinces her about not being part of what happened. She rejects his apology, saying that everyone's already made up their mind about what really happened. Unable to sway her, Darren goes home, remembering how he first met Zack. Meanwhile, Zack visits Xandrie at her house, and tells her to keep her mouth shut because no one is going to believe her anyway. Beneath his solid demeanor, Zack feels the guilt as he thinks about the consequences of his and his friends' actions. Darren meets up with Xandrie late at night, and she tells him that she's planning on leaving, calling their school a parallel universe. The two eventually make up. The next day, Xandrie arrives at the school with a gun, and meets up with Darren. Meanwhile, Zack and Brook talk about how Darren is a liability, and Zack allows Brook to beat him up. Brook finds him just as Xandrie left, and punches him in the face. Darren runs and Brook gives him a chase inside the library. Darren sees Xandrie there, contemplating while holding the gun. The two eventually attract a crowd. Jonathan traps Darren with the crowd of students, and Brook proceeds to beat him up. Zack arrives and walks in, telling Darren that he deserves it because he went against him. He asks Brook and Jonathan to escort him out and fix the mess. Xandrie arrives in front of him, pointing the gun right in front of his face. Zack warns her that killing him won't change anything; she still won't convince everyone that she isn't crazy and that he's innocent. While outside with Brook still beating him up, Darren hears a gunshot from the inside, with everyone running out. Dizzy, he manages to go in, and sees Xandrie's dead body, who apparently committed suicide, unable to shoot Zack. The following days, Zack throws another party. Meanwhile, Darren devices a plan with his friend, Shay O'Brien, and coerces him into making Zack comment on his friends negatively, and films it. Meanwhile, Darren convinces Simone to drug Zack's drink, to which she reluctantly agrees because of his threats. Everyone in the party finds out about the video Darren let out, with Brook and Jonathan finding out about Shay's conversation with Zack. Various televisions inside house open up, revealing two empty seats, much to everyone's confusion. Zack goes and follows Darren  in the basement, but he falls unconscious. When he wakes up, he is bound in one of the seats, with Darren pointing a gun at him. Everyone in the party watches while this happens, and Darren needs the votes of the students through text, in order to find out who should be killed. He sits beside Zack, and waits as the students send their votes via text message. A gun devised by Darren automatically kills one of them, depending on who gets the most votes. The gun eventually shoots, apparently killing one of them.
