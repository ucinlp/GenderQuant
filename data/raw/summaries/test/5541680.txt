The film takes place during the 1960s space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. Dr. Wilhelm von Huber , a top NASA scientist, relocates to Cape Canaveral with his 12-year-old son, Billy . Their relationship has become strained in the wake of the recent death of Billy's mother, and the ever-widening gap between father and son has become obvious. Billy finds his father old-fashioned and boring. He wants to lead an exciting life: to be a hero like the astronaut Alan Shepard. However, Billy's life takes an exciting turn when he is hired by Dr. Donni McGuinness , the Director of Veterinary Sciences, to help train the chimpanzees for NASA space missions. Billy begins to develop a close bond with one particular chimp named Mac. With Billy's help and companionship, Mac is chosen to become the first American astronaut launched into space. All seems like a wonderful game until Billy realizes that his new friend is being prepared to be hurled hundreds of miles into orbit on a historical mission - and that someone  at NASA is about to sabotage the mission. Mac's big chance to explore the farthest frontier and hurtle America ahead in the race to space might easily cost him his life.
