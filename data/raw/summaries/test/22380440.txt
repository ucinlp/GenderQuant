An ensemble comedy, the plot begins when Kira, reeling from a brutal break-up, sleeps with Max, a charming but disheveled wreck already committed to longtime girlfriend Sara. Max becomes obsessed, mostly with Kira, but vaguely with his curious lack of conscience as well. Kira, fighting to win a job she hates and running aimless romantic loops, faces the precarious double challenge of choosing a next step and charting a course back to sanity.
