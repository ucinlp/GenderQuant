Estelle Rolfe  is a one-person protest army: she goes to jail over grocery prices, shames construction workers for catcalls to passing women, and won't cross a picket line for her son's wedding. She also loves films starring Greta Garbo, the film actress whose transition from silent films to her first sound film was ballyhooed in advertisements with the slogan "GARBO TALKS." When Estelle learns she has a brain tumor and six months to live, she decides she must meet Garbo. Her dutiful son, Gilbert , a Manhattan accountant named for Garbo's co-star in several films, John Gilbert, intends to fulfill his mother's wish despite Garbo's known reclusiveness. Gilbert hires a paparazzo  to show him Garbo's apartment, stakes it out, gets a job delivering food there, seeks her on Fire Island, and tracks her to a Sixth Avenue flea market. As his obsession distances him from his wife , he's drawn to a struggling actress  he meets at work.
