Venkat Ramakrishnan ([[Srikanth , Sevarkodi Senthil  and Panchavan Parivendan ([[Vijay  are three engineering students who share a room in the hostel of Ideal Engineering College , Chennai. Venkat, who hails from a middle class family, wants to be a wildlife photographer, but is studying engineering because his father wants him to be an engineer. Senthil, hailing from a poor family, is studying engineering to raise his family's fortunes and get them out of poverty. On the other hand, Pari is studying engineering for his simple passion in machines and devices. Pari believes that success in studying is not achieved by solely memorizing definitions given by textbooks or professors, but by understanding and applying the concepts. He believes that one should follow excellence, not success, as success will come itself if excellence is followed. However, this different approach is sneered upon by the faculties, including the dean of the college, Professor Virumandi "Virus" Santhanam . Virus and the faculty favour Pari's classmate Srivatsan , also known as "Silencer", who is the complete opposite of Pari, believing in mindless memorising over understanding, in order to reach his goals of corporate and social status. Pari constantly spars with Virus and Srivatsan due to their differences in their educational approaches. Pari also believes in the concept of "All Is Well", in which people should focus on the present and live it as it is, instead of worrying over the future as in the case of Senthil, who constantly thinks of the fate of his unmarried elder sister and his paralysed father. Meanwhile, Pari falls in love with Virus' daughter Ria , a medical student, when he, Venkat and Senthil meet her when they accidentally crash her elder sister Swetha's  wedding reception to obtain a free meal. Ria is not impressed with Pari's antics and complains to her father about them. Virus becomes furious with Pari and his friends, labels them as "idiots" and tries to break the friendship between the 3 of them by telling Senthil and Venkat that Pari is a bad influence on them. While Venkat refuses to break his friendship with Pari, Senthil believes Virus' words and distances himself from Pari. However, when Pari saves Senthil's father's life, who had suffered a heart attack, by taking him immediately to the hospital where Ria works on the latter's scooter when the ambulance had not come, Senthil becomes grateful to Pari and reconciles with him. Ria too appreciates Pari's practicality and concern for others and falls in love with him. Later, in the semester examination, Pari tops his batch, proving that the his approach to studies does succeed. 3 years later, Pari, Venkat and Senthil break into Virus's house in a drunken state one night to allow Pari to confess his love to Ria. Venkat and Senthil cause a ruckus and urinate on the front door before fleeing. Unfortunately, Virus notices Senthil and the next day, he threatens to expel him unless he snitches on Pari. Not wanting to betray his friend or let down his family, Senthil attempts suicide by jumping from Virus' office window and ends up paralysed. Following his recovery, Senthil discards his fear of the future. Encouraged by Pari, both Senthil and Venkat gain courage to do what they were afraid to do before. Senthil takes a bold and frank approach in a campus interview, while Venkat tries to convince his parents to allow him to pursue his love of wildlife photography. Both Senthil and Venkat are successful in their endeavours. When Virus discovers that Senthil is successfully placed in a company, he creates an extremely tough final semester question paper, so that Senthil fails the examination and would not be allowed to join the company. When Ria learns of her father's plan, she helps Pari and Venkat to leak the question paper by providing them with the keys to her father's office. However, Virus catches them and expels them on the spot. Ria angrily confronts her father, revealing to him that his son  wanted to be a writer, but was forced to apply for engineering in IEC because of him. As he could not get selected there, he committed suicide. At the same time, Swetha, who is pregnant, goes into labour. A heavy thunderstorm cuts all power and floods the streets, making it impossible for the ambulance to reach Swetha, and Ria is stuck at the hospital, where she had gone for work. Pari, Venkat and Senthil, along with other students from IEC, deliver the baby using the available equipment and the inverter developed by Pari, with Ria instructing him via VoIP. When they discover that the newborn baby is apparently stillborn, Pari resuscitates the baby by saying "All is Well". Virus forgives Pari and his friends, gives Pari his treasured pen in gratitude and allows them to appear for the final semester examination. Pari eventually graduates as the "Most Outstanding Student" in his batch. After the convocation however, Pari disappears and goes into seclusion. 7 years later, Venkat and Senthil set out on a journey to Ooty to find Pari. They are joined by Srivatsan, who is now a wealthy and successful professional in the USA and is looking to seal a deal with a famous scientist and prospective business associate named Kosaksi Pasapugazh. Srivatsan's main intention in finding Pari is to find out whether Pari is more successful than him; they had made a bet 10 years ago on who would be more successful with their study approaches after Pari had humiliated him at a college function. However, when they find Pari's house in Ooty, they find a completely different man: the real Panchavan Parivendan . Confronting the real Pari, they find out from him that their friend was actually a destitute servant boy named Pappu. Pappu, who worked in Pari's household, loved learning, while Pari disliked studies. After seeing the boy's intelligence, Pari's father  agreed to allow Pappu study in Pari's place instead of working as a servant. In return, Pari would pocket Pappu's qualifications and after graduating, Pappu will cease all contact with Pari and his family. Pari reveals that Pappu is now a schoolteacher in Dhanushkodi. Later, Venkat and Senthil find out that as the fake Pari had disappeared, Ria had decided to marry her former boyfriend- a price obsessed banker whom she had dumped when the fake Pari made her realise that he loves his expensive items more than her. Venkat and Senthil rescue Ria from her wedding in Coimbatore and they along with Srivatsan drive to Dhanushkodi. At the fake Pari's school, Venkat and Senthil reunite with their long-lost friend, Ria and the fake Pari rekindle their romance, and Srivatsan mocks the fake Pari for becoming a lowly schoolteacher. He asks him to sign a "Declaration of Defeat" document for losing the bet. The fake Pari signs the document and when Srivatsan sees the signature, he is shocked to find out that the fake Pari's real name is actually Kosaksi Pasupugazh. Srivatsan accepts defeat and begs Kosaksi to sign the business deal, which the latter apparently refuses.
