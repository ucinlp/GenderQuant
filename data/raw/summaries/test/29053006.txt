Mertkan  is a young man who has a stable but unfulfilling life in Istanbul, living at home with his parents, working as an errand boy in his father's construction company, hanging out with his friends in shopping malls and discos. When he meets GÃ¼l , a Kurdish girl from eastern Turkey, Mertkan starts to become a bit more self-confident and it seems possible that he could break away from his oppressive parents. But Mertkan's domineering father opposes any association with "those people who only want to divide our country."
