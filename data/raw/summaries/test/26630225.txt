Asso, an ace poker player, has just married his long-time love, Silvia, the most coveted woman in his neighborhood. For her sake, he promises to give up poker, but the unexpected arrival of a notorious player in town and his wife's permission push him into one last game, which he wins. But as he tries to return home the following morning, he is apprehended by the Killer, one of his closer acquaintances, who has been hired to do away with Asso himself. Shot several times, Asso dies but returns as a ghost out of worry for leaving his wife behind without any means of supporting herself. Because of their close bond, Silvia can see and hear him, but to anyone else Asso is invisible. After managing to convince his wife that he really is dead, he tries to get her remarried so she won't end up on the streets, and his choice falls on the feeble but rich banker Morgan. Morgan is of course delighted to win the attention of such a beautiful lady, but this invites the jealousy of Bretella, Asso's rival over Silvia's hand. As it turns out, Bretella had commissioned the Killer to assassinate Asso and now tries to hire him again to finish off Morgan. Shaken by remorse over killing Asso, the Killer refuses and even promises to go to the police, whereupon Bretella kills him and decides to do the job himself. However, after getting a short leave of absence from Hell, the Killer reveals Bretella's true intentions to Asso, who rushes to Morgan's protection. While he cannot prevent Bretella from kidnapping the banker, he does prevent Morgan from getting killed and gets Bretella arrested. In his desperation, however, Morgan has started praying to his dead wife for salvation, and once rescued, he revokes his courtship of Silvia due to what he perceives to be his wife's grace. Alone once more , Silvia returns to the gambling den where she met Asso for the first time, only to encounter a young card player who is a dead look-alike of Asso. Once she falls for him, Asso fades away and goes to Heaven, where God himself  invites him to a round of poker and, following Asso's defeat, a rematch in about three thousand years.
