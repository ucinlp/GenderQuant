Like Berry Blossom Festival before it, it is basically two of the TV episodes shown back to back:  The Pie-Man and Sour Grapes scheme to take over Strawberryland by having Sour Grapes pose as a dance instructor and keep the girls busy. However, Sour Grapes soon had a change of heart and found that she really does enjoy teaching the girls, and betrays the Pie-Man.  A new girl, Apricot, moves into Strawberryland. However, she makes up tall tales to try to blend in to the group. Soon, however, she learns that one doesn't need tall tales to have someone like them.
