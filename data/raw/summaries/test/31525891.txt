The drama primarily focuses on the relationship between assistant manager Jimmy Murphy and the young player Bobby Charlton. The film begins in 1956 as Murphy gives Charlton his first chance to play a match with Manchester United's first team, nicknamed the "Busby Babes" due to their unique pedigree as an entirely club-nurtured team of players. Meanwhile, manager Matt Busby persuades Football League administrator Alan Hardaker to allow his team to play in the European Cup with the proviso that they are back in time for each scheduled fixture. The team see success both at home and abroad. However, the terrible events of the 1958 Munich air disaster leave the team with only four surviving players who are able to play. Against the odds, Murphy vows to present a team to play their next home game and, ultimately, the 1958 FA Cup Final.
