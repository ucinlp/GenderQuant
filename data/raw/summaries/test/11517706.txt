Eric G. Johnson wrote and directed Tweek City, a film depicting a harrowing week in the life of Bill Jensen , a young, sexually confused, half-Latino speed-dealer in San Francisco's Mission District. As the week begins, Bill picks up a bag of speed and starts walking the streets in a desperate attempt to make some money and, more importantly, escape his nightmares. Streetwalking leads to bed-hopping and Bill falls for a one-night stand just long enough to earn, and subsequently, betray her trust. When Bill wakes up from the whole affair in an excretory abyss, his friend Jerm  provides some support, however Bill fails to express what's truly bothering him. Just when Bill might open up, Jerm drags him to a punk show, takes an ill-advised stage dive and becomes incapacitated. Left alone, Bill canâ€™t cope and he plunges into a speed-induced, downward spiral that takes him on a nocturnal journey through the streets of San Francisco, and ultimately down to Los Angeles, where he crashes his high school sweetheart's wedding. From his sleep-deprived, hallucinogenic state, Bill makes a desperate attempt to reconnect with Sharon , his first, and only, love.
