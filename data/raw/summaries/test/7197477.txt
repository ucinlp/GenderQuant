The film begins with the audition process, in which Caramello is introduced to MTV icon Carson Daly, one of Caramello's biggest idols, who is also up for the role of the main character "Stone Fury" . After a botched audition, interrupted numerous times by Barris and Mole, he eventually wins the role over Daly . The plot of the movie he is supposed to be in is a dubious story involving "sports private eye" Fury trying to track down the actual refrigerator of William "Refrigerator" Perry and the pants of Ernie Banks . The film is directed by Bobcat Goldthwait, who is the actual director, in addition to playing the director of the fake film-within-the-film, and only speaks to people through a bullhorn. Caramello is followed around by at least fifteen cameras  during the filming process. He is told from the beginning that he is being recorded and interviewed for the film's DVD extras. Some of the pranks include repeatedly dumping him into a dumpster filled with manure; making him drink a milkshake made of coffee, Chinese food, raw egg, pizza, and beer, giving him a case of severe diarrhea; and bringing in a stunt double to film Caramello's sex scene with his leading lady. Along the way, Barris and Mole continue to egg him on, performing a balancing act of pushing his buttons and stroking his ego. The stress increasingly infuriates Caramello and frequently leads him to scream in a high-pitched shriek. Barris regularly tells Perry to "unleash the Fury". Throughout the filmmaking process, Perry is introduced to several individuals, purported to be real people, whose names are identical to historical and cinematic figures. Such individuals include the producer of the movie, "John Quincy Adams" , casting director "Roman Polanski", played by Dane Cook, studio receptionist and soon to be co-star, "Susan B. Anthony" , Japanese "money man" "Hiroshima Nagasaki" , limo driver "Travis Bickle", set photographer "Ansel Adams" , "Frances Farmer" , Caramello's personal assistant "Burt Ward" and stagehands "Sacco and Vanzetti". Perry never questions these coincidences, though he does express doubts as to the identity of a man purporting to be Charlton Heston, who refused to leave Perry's assigned trailer. To placate him, Perry suavely offered the old man a cameo in the film, which he enthusiastically accepts with humorous results. The film culminates in an intentionally hindered race to the fake film's "one time only screening" during which Perry is delayed by a number of setbacks, until finally making it in time to see a select few scenes of the film. The film itself  features laughably unrealistic special effects, lines of dialogue ripped from Casablanca and Gone with the Wind, and even a dinosaur . Following the screening, Perry is met with a round of applause from the audience, and is presented with a trophy from the "President of Show Business". A running gag in the movie is that whenever Caramello's name appears in print , it is misspelled. When the DVD of the film was released in 2006, the cover is listed as starring "Perry Karamello". Cameo appearances also include Tammy Faye Bakker.
