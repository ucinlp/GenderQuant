Four junior college students  are driving along a deserted road in Florida on their way to a cheerleading competition. As Jimbo is driving, Cookie gives him a blow job, while Jasmine secretly watches from the backseat. Distracted, Jimbo swerves and hits a utility pole, damaging the car. While looking for help, they find and enter a vacant house, which is actually home to Andre the Butcher, who is not presently there. Jimbo and Kristy decide to go back to the car and wait for help, while Cookie and Jasmine stay behind. Cookie confronts the closeted Jasmine and the two engage in lesbian sex. Meanwhile, escaped convicts Tober and Hoss are seeking refuge. They enter Andre's house and find Cookie and Jasmine having sex. The convicts order them into the living room at gunpoint. While in the living room, Sheriff Cooper comes by and knocks on the door. Hoss orders Jasmine to answer it and get rid of him, threatening to kill Cookie if she doesn't comply. Sheriff Cooper enters the house and informs her of the escaped convicts and asks her if she's seen them. As she tries to quietly tell him that they are in the house, the Sheriff grabs Jasmine and begins to molest her with his baton. Hoss comes out of hiding and kicks the sheriff in the stomach, handcuffs him to the fridge, and leaves him there while they all drive away in his patrol car. Jimbo and Kristy, while waiting by a tree, prepare to make out after Kristy reveals intimate feelings towards him. Andre the Butcher shows up and attacks them. He kills Kristy after luring her away and throws a knife at Jimbo, pinning him to a tree. Jimbo is rescued by Deputy Hollingsworth, who is looking for the escaped convicts, and they both head back to the lodge. As Tober, Hoss, Cookie, and Jasmine are driving away in the Sheriff's car, they encounter Andre on the road, blocking their path. After Tober tries to shoot him, Andre drags him out of the car and kills him. The other three run away and go back to the house. Jimbo also returns with Hollingsworth, who then handcuffs Hoss. Sheriff Cooper, still handcuffed in the kitchen demands she uncuff him, but Jasmine pleas with her not to. Suddenly, the television set turns on, which shows some of their sins: Kristy eats too much and Sheriff Cooper is corrupt. Andre shows up and murders the Sheriff. Hollingsworth shoots at Andre who runs away, but later returns and kills Jimbo and Cookie. While in the basement, Jasmine discovers that Andre is not actually human, but something supernatural. Back in the 1950s, he was an ordinary man, had a wife and daughter and he owned a meat market in town. However, his wife and daughter were both killed in a tragic accident. This enraged Andre and drove him insane. He began to murder his customers and sell their flesh as meat. The townspeople eventually caught on and lynched him. He was buried in a wooden box in a field near his house. His soul was sent to hell, but the devil elected him as his head recruiter on Earth. His duty was to murder sinners, whose souls would be sent to hell. Because he was never given a proper burial, the only way to destroy his demon form on Earth is to bless his grave, which will allow for redemption. Hoss, Jasmine, and Hollingsworth flee the house with two jugs of holy water , to find his grave and bless it. However, Andre pursues them and while running, the jugs break, spilling all the water. He kills Hollingsworth, and stabs both Hoss and Jasmine. Now without any water and seemingly defeated, they both crawl over to his grave, preparing to die together. Having to urinate, Hoss decides to use his own urine in place of water. Too weak to do it himself, he asks Jasmine to pull his penis out and aim for him. He urinates on the grave and blesses the urine, which works as holy water, killing Andre. The movie ends with Hoss and Jasmine apparently surviving, despite still badly wounded.
