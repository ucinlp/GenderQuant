Bugs is about to conduct "The Warner Bros. Symphony Orchestra"  fancily. When he finishes his elaborate preparation, he starts to conduct, but is interrupted by someone in the audience couching loudly. Bugs then holds out a sign saying "Throw the bum out!", which the audience does. Other problems plague Bugs' conducting, notably a bothersome fly and some awkward cuffs that keep falling off. In the middle of the performance, Bugs acts an indigenous person being chased by American troops . The fly then returns at the end of the act, landing in Bugs' nose. Bugs then loses his sanity and attempts to kill the fly, crashing into the orchestra and the instruments as he does so. As the music comes to a stop, Bugs bows for the crowd, and instead of applause, hears only silence and crickets chirping. Bugs looks around to see that the seats are empty and the crowd has gone, though he does hear some faint clapping - coming from the fly. Bugs bows to the fly and the episode ends.
