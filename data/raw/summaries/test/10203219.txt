Anthony Waldron intends to steal a new submarine invention from Dr. Kittridge while blaming a fictitious mastermind he calls "Mr. M." To further this plan, Waldron uses a mind control drug he has developed called "Hypnotreme." However, a mystery villain soon appears claiming to be the real Mr. M and starts giving Waldron orders. Federal agent Grant Farrell, whose brother was killed by Waldron, is dispatched to find the mysterious villain and stop his nefarious plans, teaming up with Kirby Walsh and Shirley Clinton to do so.
