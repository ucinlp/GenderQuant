 Heynick op cit., pp. 29-31, which contains a more extensive and detailed plot summary The titles and credits open with a scene  of a triumphant street procession and a jubilant crowd hailing William Morton  with signs such as "Pain is no more," followed by the written prologue. Next, an old Eben Frost  is seen heading throught the snow to the farmhouse of Morton's aging widow Lizzie . On the way he stops at a pawnshop and redeems a medal once awarded to Morton inscribed "To the benefactor of mankind." At the Morton home, Lizzie reminisces to Frost about her late husband and their life together, although the nature of Morton's achievement is vague. In the brief first flashback , Morton mortgages his farm to pay for a trip to Washington to meet President Franklin Pierce . The president declares his intention to ratify a large monetary sum awarded to Morton by a grateful congress, but tells him that he should first legitimize his claim in court by filing a patent infringement suit against some army or navy doctor. The newspapers loudly denouce Morton's greed, the court declares his discovery unpatentable, and Morton runs amuk in a shop which is selling his discovery with no credit or royalties to him. The scene shifts back to the farmhouse and the aging Lizzie, who tells the details of the broken Morton's recent death and then continues her reminiscing, now about their life together before, during, and immediately after Morton's discovery. The second flashback, which makes up most of the movie, follows Morton and Lizzie's courtship, early married years, and his tribulations as a dentist with patients who fear the pain of dental operations. Morton consults his former professor Charles T. Jackson , who cantankerously suggests cooling the gums and roots with topical application of chloric ether. Morton ignorantly purchases a bottle of sulphuric ether and passes out when it evaporates in the living room of his home. Later, Morton's former partner Horace Wells comes by, telling of his discovery that nitrous oxide  could serve as an inhalable general anesthetic and asks Morton's assistance at a planned tooth extraction at Harvard Medical School before the class of prominent surgeon John Collins Warren . The demonstration fails  when the patient cries out. Wells, however is convinced of nitrous oxide's efficacy, but soon swears it off when his next patient almost fails to revive from an overdose. Morton, thinking back to his passing out from inadvertently inhaling suphuric ether vapor, wonders whether this instead could serve as an inhalable general anesthetic. He tries the gas on patient Frost, who goes beserk. Morton consults Jackson, who explains that the ether must be of the highly rectified type. The next trial with Frost succeeds, and Morton, who is camouflaging the smell of the sulphuric ether and calling it "Letheon," is soon raking in a fortune with his painless dentistry. However, Jackson and Wells now accuse Morton of having stolen their respective ideas. Morton is now thinking about the possible use of his "Letheon" in general surgery. He approaches surgeon Warren, who is highly sceptical, but agrees to a demonstration at Massachusetts General Hospital. The operation , the excising of a neck tumor before doctors and students in the operating theater, proceeds painlessly. Warren now schedules a public demonstration for a more serious operation -- a leg amputation. On the scheduled day, however, representatives of the state Medical Society, jealous of the success of this upstart dentist, demand that, in accordance with established medical ethics, Morton first reveal the chemical composition of his "Letheon." Morton refuses to do so until his pending patent is granted, but says that in the meantime he will let all hospitals and charitable institutions  use his compound free of charge. The Medical Society representatives declare this unacceptable and surgeon Warren says he has no alternative but to perform the scheduled amputation without anesthesia. As the bewildered Morton wanders through the hospital corridors, he comes across the girl whose leg is to amputated, being prayed over by a priest. Taking pity on her, he marches into the operating theater to reveal his secret to surgeon Warren -- and to the world.
