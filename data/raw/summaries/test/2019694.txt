The film opens with scenes of birth. Clips are shown of various babies in development and until they are birthed. Next, the film features clips of childhood, then dance and sex. Using footage of a nude woman eating a banana, the film then transitions into clips of food, then starvation, then riots, then death. By transitioning from death processions to ceremonies in general, the focus is again brought to dance. After showing some clips of art and massive groups, the film ends with a woman pregnant in a tub.
