Smith preempts the start of the interview by giving a summary of what he sees as the three inescapable problems that have faced humans from the earliest development of civilization: how to earn a living, how to get along with our fellow humans, and how to get along with our selves. He compares how the three enduring civilizations: East Asia , South Asia  and the West, have dealt with these problems in distinctive ways.Review of DVD by Harry Moody, AARP
