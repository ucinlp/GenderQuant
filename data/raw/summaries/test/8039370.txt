In the medival era, a witch named Mamba is tortured and skinned alive in punishment for her crimes. Her skin and organs are then used to make a cursed game. If a player wins the game they are granted a wish, however if a player loses the game they are killed in a fashion predicted by the game. Present day, Jason , while shopping with his friend Tomas  and Tomas' girlfriend Lisa , acquires the board game from a handicapped shop owner called Malek . The three friends travel back to Tomas' beachfront house, and at night a party occurs on the beach. Jason meets Erica , before it begins to rain, causing most of the partiers to leave, leaving behind only Jason, Erica, Tomas, Lisa, Elena , Miguel  and Pablo . Erica suggests that the group should play the game, to which they all agree. However, Pablo is soon eliminated and takes Tomas' car to go to the shop and get beer. On his travel, Pablo stops to urinate, but falls over the edge of a cliff. He survives the fall, but is barely alive. A group of crabs then attack Pablo, gouging out his eyes and killing him. Meanwhile, Miguel, Lisa, Elena and Tomas also lose the game, before Detective Izar  arrives and alerts the group of Pablo's death, cutting the game short. The group attend Pablo's funeral, where Erica realizes his death mirrors the games prediction. Soon after, Tomas, Lisa and Miguel travel to a wood-cutting factory, that belongs to Miguel's family but is currently empty, to have a photo shoot. While Lisa models, she feels unwell and stops the photo shoot and leaves with Tomas. After their departure, Miguel is attacked by snakes. He attempts to climb a stack of logs, but a snake bites him and he falls into a large group of snakes that kill him with their venomous bites. Meanwhile, Jason and Erica start up a romance. While they are in Jason's car they witness ghostly versions of Pablo and Miguel, before they receive a call from Tomas telling them of Miguel's death. Jason and Erica meet Tomas, Lisa and Elena at Tomas' apartment where they tell the others they suspect the group are dying because of the game. Tomas, Lisa and Elena remain skeptical to the idea however. After Jason, Erica and Elena have left, Lisa becomes more ill. Tomas tends to her, before the pair go to bed. The following morning, Lisa has aged significantly into an old woman and is rushed to hospital. Jason, Erica and Elena arrive at the hospital and tell Detective Izar their theory about the game. They then go in to see Lisa. Elena becomes distraught at her appearance and about her friends deaths, leaving despite Tomas' attempts to get her to stay. Lisa soon dies, prompting Jason, Erica and Tomas to seek answers from Malek. They find Malek at his home where he is no longer handicapped. He explains to them that he won the game and wished to no longer be handicapped. Meanwhile, Elena is traveling home to Milan in her car when she is involved in a car accident. Her car leaks gas, and a broken electrical wire ignites it, burning Elena to death. Jason, Erica and Tomas go to Jason's house where they find Detective Izar looking for the game. Jason and Erica escape with it, but Tomas is caught by the Detective, who puts him in the trunk of his car. Later, Jason receives a call from the Detective demanding the game in return for Tomas, but Tomas attempts to escape and the Detective shoots him dead. At Tomas' beachfront house, Jason and Erica decide to play the game in hope that they can win and wish for it to be a week in the past, so their friends would be alive. Erica is eliminated, and realizes her death will involve the sea. Jason wins the game, and will get his wish as long as he passes the game onto another person. Jason and Erica go to bed, but Erica discovers she must die for Jason to get his wish, so she enters the sea. Jason wakes up and rushes out to save her, but Detective Izar shows up and takes the game away and leaves. Erica then emerges from the sea and reveals herself to be Mamba, granting Jason his wish. However, Jason and his friends then become trapped, forced to relive the week again and again.
