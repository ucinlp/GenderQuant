Emily  and Nate Weaver  are a happily married couple living in New York. Nate is a recognized artist, Emily a fashion designer and the two are expecting their first child. Emily suffers a terrible miscarriage during a dinner party and she is informed that the scarring left on her womb means that she will never be able to conceive again. To give them both a fresh start, Nate and Emily move out into the countryside to Nate's family home which has been uninhabited for some time. At first enchanted by it, Emily is horrified when a skeleton is discovered during an inspection of the house plumbing but it is obvious that the body is very old so no danger can be attached to the house. Nate decides to use the large outdoor shed as a studio while Emily takes one of the old bedrooms as her workshop. After Emily discovers an old trunk filled with baby things in the cellar she pays a visit to the local Historical Society and is told that the house has a past she and Nate were unaware of. Several suspicious deaths have occurred at the property and a female relative of Nate's vanished without trace when the house was new. Nate grows distant as he starts painting again and he refuses to let Emily see his new work. Tense and isolated, Emily starts to see visions of a woman covered with blood and faints. After seeing the doctor, who thinks she is suffering from trauma, she gets a phone call to tell her that she is actually pregnant. Ordered to spend the bulk of her pregnancy in bed resting due to the high risk of miscarriage, Emily starts to get bored and frustrated by Nate who is working longer and longer hours and seems uninterested in her or the coming baby. Emily's visions continue and she thinks that she can see the missing aunt of Nate's walking about the property. Organising a party so she can see her city friends, she believes that Nate's agent is having an affair with her husband. Soon afterwards the agent somehow falls through the window in Emily's studio and is hospitalised. Nate thinks Emily may have pushed her as he saw her in the rom after the woman fell and tells Emily's best friend that he is concerned for Emily's health. When the couple receive a call to tell them that the agent has died, Nate storms out. Emily reads through a folder of press cuttings left by the historical society and discovers that all the women who died at the house were killed by their husbands. She has another vision of the dead woman and believes that Nate is coming back to kill her. She calls her best friend who tells her that she will come and pick her up. Terrified, Emily hides in her bedroom with a knife when she hears Nate come back into the house. She tries to stab him with the knife but instead stabs her friend- who had driven back with Nate. She and Nate then fight resulting in Emily killing Nate. At the hospital a scan reveals that Emily is not pregnant although she believes that she is- the phone call from the doctor and the visions were all in her head, a symptom of psychosis. Emily is left in a padded room, rocking her imaginary child in her arms.
