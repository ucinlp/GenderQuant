Xiao Mei used to live with her grandparents up in the mountains. When she later moves to the city to live with her parents, she finds the place cold and distant as compared to the village she once lived in. She longs for a simple and carefree life, and the experience of lying down on a field at night and looking up at the starry night above. Her parents are experiencing work-related stress and are having marriage problems. One day, Xiao Mei was attracted to a beautiful recorder melody of a Christmas carol being played by her neighbor. She later learns that the neighbor is called Xiao Jie, a problematic child who is a new student in her school. Xiao Mei starts to be attracted to Xiao Jie, who is always getting bullied by the rest of his classmates after he was deemed "cocky". The pair's friendship grows deeper after Xiao Mei saves Xiao Jie from these bullies. They decorated their classroom together for an inter-class competition, and Xiao Mei took to shoplifting for fun after seeing Xiao Jie shoplift. Xiao Mei later shares information on French art with Xiao Jie while she tries to purchase a jigsaw piece from a puzzle of "Starry Starry Night" to replace the one that she had lost. Suddenly, shortly after her beloved grandfather's death, Xiao Mei's parents announce that they will be divorcing. Upon hearing that, Xiao Mei's world starts to fall apart. She runs away from home, together with Xiao Jie, to visit the small wooden shack that she shared with her grandparents in the past. On the way to the shack, Xiao Mei leads both of them up a wrong path and they got lost in the forest. Luckily, they found an abandoned church to stay in overnight. That night, Xiao Mei gets to know more about Xiao Jie's tremulous family background, and she stops pitying her own family background. They eventually found the wooden shack the next day, and Xiao Mei starts to look though her grandfather's workshop. In the night, the weather was too foggy for them to enjoy the stars. Xiao Mei also starts to develop a fever. As Xiao Jie was carrying her back to the wooden shack, he gets a short glimpse of the beautiful night sky that Xiao Mei was talking about. Upon reaching the shack, Xiao Jie contacted their parents while Xiao Mei was asleep. When she woke up, she found herself on a hospital bed. Later, when Xiao Mei was in the 10th grade, she received the jigsaw piece that her puzzle of the "Starry Starry Night" painting was missing. Many years later, in France, Xiao Mei and her stepsister were walking along the streets on Christmas Eve. Suddenly Xiao Mei's stepsister saw a jigsaw puzzle with a missing piece on display. Upon entering the shop, Xiao Mei saw a jigsaw of "Starry Starry Night" which had the same missing piece as hers.
