The film is the story of the de-population of one of the isolated, outer islands of Scotland as, one by one, the younger generation leaves for the greater opportunities offered by the mainland, making it harder to follow the old ways of life there. Robbie Manson  wants to leave the island and explore the wider world. Robbie's friend Andrew Gray  and his sister, Ruth Manson  are sweethearts and are quite willing to stay. Of their fathers, Peter Manson  is determined to stay while James Gray  suspects that their way of life cannot last much longer. But if Robbie leaves, that will make it harder for the others because there will be one less young man to help with the fishing and the crofting.
