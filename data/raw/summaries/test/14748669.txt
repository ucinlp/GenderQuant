 Illibatezza  by Roberto Rossellini is a story of a beautiful stewardess which attracts unwanted attention from one of the air travellers - a middle aged American. The two overnight by chance in the same hotel. She has a fiance back home, to whom she sends video recordings made with her portable camera. These show how, in order to shoo away the unwanted flirtatious attentions of the traveller, all she had to do was to act in an aggressively provocative way; his sexual attraction being fueled by the shyness with which she initially tried to endure his advances.  Il Nuovo Mondo  by Jean-Luc Godard is set in Paris and shows the end of the world, caused by a nuclear explosion in the sky 120,000 meters above Paris. The main characters are a young French couple. The man notices significant changes  in all of the people around him, including his girlfriend. He is beware of being influenced by these global mental changes himself, and records his observations regarding the catastrophe in a notebook.  {{main}} Pasolini's La ricotta  tells the story of filming a movie about the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at a slightly hilly waste ground near a residential area. The main character is a simple man playing a bit part - one of the two men who were crucified with Christ, in particular the one who asks Christ to take him in heaven. After giving his own rations to his wife and children, he finds himself hungry. Disguised in women's clothing and a wig he sneaks some more rations. Before he can eat it however he has to film his scene and so hides it. When he gets back however, he discovers that the dog belonging to the films star has found his hiding place. Subsequent to this he sells a dog to a reporter and buys enough curd cheese and bread to feed himself. At the end, he dies from gastric congestion on the cross while filming. When the film director  is interviewed by a reporter, he calls the reporter a middle man and conformist, telling him that if he should die right now, it would be a nice plot development. He then reads to the reporter from Pasolini's book titled "Mamma Roma".  Gregoretti's Il Pollo Ruspante  shows an Italian middle-class family with two children traveling via an autostrada  to the site of a real-estate project where they could be interested in buying a detached house. While they do a laringotomized marketing executive presents a lecture to a businessmen's seminar, reciting passage after passage in an impersonal, mechanical tone through a vocalizing apparatus. The lecturer teaches the businessmen how to "stimulate consumption" via the substitution of small shops  with large supermarkets, where people could more easily give over to their instincts, grabbing frivolous or useless articles from the shelves on a whim due to the delay of the moment of bill presentation and payment. The family visits a highway service station with an adjoining supermarket and restaurant. In the supermarket the children clamor to have candies and toys bought for them and the parents give in for fear of "letting people think they're poor"; then they all sit down to consume a drab standardized meal where the father can't convince the waitress to bring him "just one egg"  and has to explain his children the difference between battery-bred chicken and free ranging ones . The family finally reaches the development site where an enthusiastic real estate agent pressures them to reserve a yet-to-be-built house while telling off the warden  for having planted cabbages and other vegetables in a small patch of land, trampling over it and destroying the plants. The lecture goes on, in a harrowing enunciation of tricks and strategies to push consumerism to ever higher heights, all exemplified in corpore vivo by the family's odyssey. Finally, when in the evening the family is getting back to Milan, the father having decided against buying the house, a car accident befalls them, probably killing them all. The robot-voiced marketing executive concludes his exposition and is cheered by the businessmen' crowd, who congratulate him as they all leave the meeting room.
