1918 - After getting medals for "Wounds in action" , the Stooges are discharged from the army immediately following the end of World War I, whereupon they rough up Sgt. MacGillicuddy . 1935 - The Stooges are traveling the streets hungry and are tricked into signing up for the army again. Naturally, MacGillicuddy is again the sergeant in charge. In the colonel's office the still-hungry Stooges fall upon some tomatoes McGillicuddy brought in. He orders them to throw away the tomatoes and, demonstrating, hits a colonel. As punishment McGillicuddy is assigned to polishing spittoons. The Stooges bring him more to clean but soon fall into the table of shining spittoons. Then they are assigned to coast artillery and begin practicing their skills, such as they are. They first hit a smokestack, then a house, next a bridge, and lastly, a battleship, which just happens to be the admiral's flagship. Sgt. MacGillicuddy and some officers rush up to investigate, and the Stooges point fingers at each other in mutual blame. The frustrated sergeant asks them to line up a photo shoot. The Stooges agree, glad to be awarded for their sharp shooting, and pose as Sgt. MacGillicuddy swings the gun at them and fires, leaving three pairs of smoking boots behind.
