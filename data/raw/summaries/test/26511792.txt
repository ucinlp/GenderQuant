The movie Shame narrates tragic happenings, brought on by the inspirational footsteps of a mature woman named 'Asta,' after her motorbike breaks down in a small town  during a lone tour of outback Australia. In her dilemma she crosses paths with the town mechanic's daughter 'Lizzie,' who has been gang-raped by a pack of youths; the scandal owing much to the repressive attitude adopted by much of the town . When Asta first arrives in the town, she sets foot in the local pub where many of the men treat her with little respect. Redirected to the town's mechanic, Asta stays with the mechanic's family  as a guest. The family, including Lizzie's father Tim, are visibly troubled and suffering from some sort of depressive situation. One night when Lizzie can not bear her parent's fighting anymore, she runs outside crying, where Asta  reaches out to her. This forms the beginning of their connection together. After experiences with The 'gang' of young men - who apart from collectively having raped several girls in the town and who behave with little respect - begin to increase in intensity of badness  Asta begins to speak more openly and energetically, in public and private, about the scandalous affairs which she has learned are occurring in this isolated town. Vociferously protesting the policeman's complacency and even ignorance of the situation, Asta begins to act as a role-model and even as a source of strength, to the violated and injusticed Lizzie, whose own father even struggles to deny the truth of what has happened under his very nose. Championed on by Asta, Little by little, Lizzie draws upon enough courage to begin both straying further from the safety of her own house, and confronting her own father about his denial. But even her own house becomes unsafe in the culmination of her perpetrator's provocation; Asta's firm resolve for justice - which has inspired not only Lizzie's father, but also her family and friends to face the truth - results in blind rage when the young men learn Asta and Lizzie means business; they are going the distance to press charges to get them imprisoned; and the men realize that their freedom to be blazenly reckless and get away with it , is under serious threat. This sets off the chain of events which results in tragedy.
