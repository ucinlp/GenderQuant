Three women of widely differing backgrounds walk out of the gates of London's Holloway Prison together at the end of their respective sentences. Monica Marsden  is a well-bred young woman, led into the world of crime by her smooth-talking but crooked lover David , who martyred herself by taking the fall for a crime he masterminded; Stella Jarvis  is a beautiful working-class girl who found her attractive appearance made West End prostitution a source of easy money before being imprisoned after disregarding numerous cautions for soliciting; Mrs. Quilliam  is a kindly elderly widow living in poverty and jailed for repeat shoplifting offences. Monica proposes that the three should meet up later for dinner for which she will pay, to discuss how their first day of freedom has gone. Events before and after the dinner are explored as the film switches focus between each protagonist and how they set about picking up their lives. During her incarceration, Monica has had time to reflect and initially is full of thoughts of vengeance towards David for allowing her to take the blame while he walked away scot free. When she meets up with him however, she finds her old feelings returning with a vengeance and starts once again to fall under his spell. Stella is full of good intentions to get back on track and turn her life around, away from the lure of her previous sordid but lucrative profession. Mrs. Quilliam, disregarded and ignored by her family, returns to her spartan home, consoled by the mongrel dog she loves and regards as the most important presence in her life. Over the course of 24 hours, each faces a struggle with herself to avoid a quick return to her recidivist ways. David still exerts a powerful hold over Monica; Stella, despite herself, is drawn back to her old haunts and their promise of maximum financial gain for least endeavour; Mrs. Quilliam has no money but somehow has to provide for herself and the dog. By the next day, two of the women have succeeded in resisting the temptations put in their path, but the third finds herself back behind bars in the most ironic of circumstances.
