Plot elements have not been revealed, but official press releases have stated, "The Arcadian follows “The Lighthouse Keeper” on a story of revenge and redemption in a strange future world reminiscent of wild 1970s pop sci-fi. The visual world of The Arcadian is an homage to the work of underground illustrators while creating something that is both unique and distinct."
