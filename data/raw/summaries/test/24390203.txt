Mr. Ronald Gibb  is a high school history teacher. Although he is depicted as a creative if weak-willed teacher, his students lack interest for the subject matter. One of his students, Ally Palmer  is a popular teenage girl and local celebrity. She was featured in a television commercial for her father's car dealership. Mr. Gibb secretly has a crush on Ally. He stares at her inappropriately multiple times a day. One day after school, he overhears Ally and her boyfriend Brett  get into a big argument. She no longer has a ride home from school, so he offers to take her home. Mr. Gibb and Ally are photographed just as she spontaneously kisses him on the lips , and as such the school board deems his behavior unacceptable and unprofessional. She goes missing after he drops her off at her house. The news reports that a kidnapping has occurred. Mr. Gibb is the primary suspect because police officials find evidence that he was with Ally moments before she was kidnapped. The film follows Gibb as he copes with public humiliation and ends with a sudden twist in the final minutes.
