Scooby Doo and the Mystery Inc. gang pick up hitchiking Gary Coleman, and the Mystery Machine soon proceeds to break down multiple times, finally leaving them stranded at a haunted castle owned by David Cross. The show contained multiple references and gags that take jabs at the original show, musical numbers by Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and Matthew Sweet, and concluded with a nonsensical ending, with Coleman pointing out all of the plot holes in the story. Scooby interrupts him by licking his face until the episode ends.
