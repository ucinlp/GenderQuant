The film tells the story of Zack and Sham, close friends who share a passion for drift racing. Though the sport is popular with men, Zack's girlfriend  took up the sport and became competitive in it. Zack is an elite racer who runs a workshop while Sham is more down to earth and always has problems with his racing car. Zack is unhappy with drug pushers selling on his racing patch, but Fasha  is friendly with some of them which leads to a confrontation between her and Zack. The pushers are sent to their boss Joe ,also a drift racer who uses race meets to sell his product. A rift continues to grow between Zack and Fasha. Sham  becomes a middleman between the two but ends up also having feelings for her. Zack wins a challenge against Joe but falls out with Sham despite the latter's numerous apologies and attempts to distance himself from Fasha. Zack and Fasha also confront each other but solve nothing, with Fasha conflicted over her dwindling feelings for Zack and her growing attraction to Sham. Joe's gang is not happy with the result and murders one of Zack and Sham's friends/mechanics. Zack angrily walks into the club Joe uses as a front but is almost killed by the gang. He is saved by Sham and Musa  but does not acknowledge or thank Sham. Musa convinces Zack that the police should be left to deal with Joe, before someone else dies. The police raid the club and arrest many gang members, though Joe is not caught. Sham meets Fasha to clear the air, stating that he is unwilling to lose his brotherly friendship with Zack, and that he wants Fasha to stop contacting him altogether. Zack arrives and totally misreads the situation, forcing Fasha to follow him home. Joe arrives in his racing car and attempts to ram Zack and Fasha. They are saved by Sham, who pushes them out of the way at the cost of great injuries. Zack chases Joe down, resulting in Joe crashing head on into a truck and flipping over. Things finish with Sham in hospital, presumably in a coma. Zack is chastized by his team members and a sobbing Fasha, though he and Fasha sit by Sham's bedside as the credits roll.
