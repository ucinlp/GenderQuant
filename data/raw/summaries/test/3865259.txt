Lim Teng Zui is a WAS technician who is a single father to a young girl named Xiao Mei. He is employed by the director of WAS' Events and Promotion department, Tanya Chew. Tanya stays in a condominium and has a single mother, a blogger whom she has neglected. He has drawn little salary, and strives hard to earn more so that he can buy her a piano and original abalone. Alan Lui, the CEO of WAS, briefs Lau Chee Hong, Eric Tan and Uncle Tiong about Minister Seetoh accompanying China's Minister of Manpower, Mr. Chen and his delegates will be visiting the department. In an effort to prepare for the VIP visit, they decide to put the things outside temporarily. However, during a Chinese minister's visit, Lim's poor work ethics, combined with his incompetence causes the minister to fall during a photoshoot when the wall gives way due to the use of masking tapes instead of nails. An investigation is carried out, and 'finger-pointing' is done to find the scapegoat, in which Lim is blamed. As a result, his bonus is cut, and Lim stems his anger toward Tanya. Their confrontation leads into a car chase in which he chases Ms. Chew's 1998 Seat Toledo in his CitroÃ«n Berlingo until the vehicles collide, causing both to run off the flyover and fall down to the beach. The duo are knocked unconscious due to this resulting accident, and are sent to the hospital. There, they are in critical condition, but amazingly, both recovers, but Lim wakes up and finds out that he is in Tanya's body. Whereas Tanya is in her employee's body. They are forced to accept into living in each other's roles and work under their respective bodies' occupation. "Lim" upgrades her/his skills as a technician, while "Tanya" idles around, performing poorly in his/her capacity as a department director. Due to "Tanya"'s negligence, the department grossly overspends and the CEO, together with Chee and Eric, two department heads who had been offended by Tanya earlier, plans to shut down the department. In an attempt to save the department from closure, Tanya and Lim plan to put on a successful Job Fair Exhibition so that the CEO would think twice about shutting it down. Tanya and Lim try ways of getting publicity, but red tape and lack of information gets in their way and they would have to wait at least three months to be able to do anything. However, it proceeds smoothly, and Tanya hires a pyrotechnics operator, who is actually a demolition expert. After a series of trials and tribulations, the Job Fair is realized. During the fair, Chee and Eric attempt to sabotage the Fair, but Tanya and Lim repaired quickly by means of masking tape. Tanya and Lim deal with the obstacles as they come until the final sing-along session on stage, with the Minister. However, the stage catches fire as the planned pyrotechnics, combined with the pyrotechnic launcher's disobedience and the direction of the launching cannon towards the curtain. Having trapped in the ensuing utter chaos, the people dash about the stage in every direction, finding a way out. The Minister finally finds an escape route when a taped board falls off. Many of them have run down without any single casualty, and thus the situation is under control. As the Civil Defense firefighters arrive on the scene to put out the fires, Tanya rescues Lim's daughter. A board of inquiry looks into the actions during the fire. During the 2007 National Creativity Award ceremony, Lim was awarded for his use of masking tapes to save 53 lives and his initiative to invent a fire escape wall. Two months later, the statutory board has folded as WAS shuts down. Uncle Tiong retires because of his heart attack. Eric is sacked and has his pension  confiscated when their plot is discovered. Chee becomes the first director in history to receive pink slip for skills obsolete. The CEO is blacklisted for making too many mistakes, but later establishes the Minced Pork Organisation, only to be dissolved months later. Lim and Tanya, having going in their separate ways other than working, decide to re-enact the accident in an attempt to switch back to their original bodies. They start their same vehicles and drive off at the same time and place, doing the same collison. As the credits roll, Lim and Tanya's attempts are revealed to be unsuccessful, but they still marry.and they have a child together.
