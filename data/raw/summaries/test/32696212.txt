Ham and Ex are reading a press release about their uncle Beans who is flying north to explore an old galleon. Outside, Beans is preparing his aircraft for his trip to the north. Without their uncle's knowledge, Ham and Ex board the backseats. Beans himself finally hops in and flies the aircraft. Beans arrives at the Arctic, parking his plane just near the frozen ship. Ham and Ex show themselves, much to their uncle's surprise. Nevertheless, Beans takes them along. The three young explorers set foot on the rickety old vessel. Ghostly forces toss Beans around while Ham and Ex get tangled with a skeleton. Finally the trio end up in the hull. In a room, they find a treasure chest with booty. Beans then notices a couple of buccaneers who have been frozen for a very long time. Beans then takes the chairs they are sitting on and lights a fire in the stove, causing the buccaneers to defrost and awaken, while Beans loads his plane with the treasure. The two buccaneers give chase to the trio, until Ham and Ex land inside the plane and take off. Meanwhile Beans dodges one of the buccaneers who hurls a powder keg at him and it explodes, launching him the air. Ham and Ex manage to rescue him in midair. After some rejoice the three explorers fly back home.
