Krishna ([[Rahul Banerjee  is a diligent scooter mechanic in Siliguri and life goes on smoothly for him until the rich schoolgirl Pallavi  sets her eyes on him. The infatuation reaches dangerous levels when she coaxes Krishna to take her away from the clutches of her family, which has other plans about her future. The film begins with the elopement, as Pallavi steps out of her house in her school uniform, leaving even her wristwatch behind since Krishna has instructed her not to take a single thing with her. The two rush into a shopping mall where Pallavi hurriedly changes into a boy’s shirt, pants and cap, leaves her uniform behind, and the two board the bus. The flashback, as point-of-view narrations between Pallavi and Krishna, are intercut with Pallavi’s don-like father and uncle terrorizing the neighbourhood in search of the truant girl. The naïve Krishna hesitantly yields to her charm and the two run away to Kolkata. Krishna's friend Ali  helps them, and the lovers marry. The couple consummates their union while the mess chaps hastily organize a proper wedding and elaborate reception. But her family is not going to give up so easily on the daughter they dote on. The family tracks down the couple and separates them. Pallavi agrees to marry another man to save Krishna's life after he is beaten by her father. While she believes this decision is best and moves on with her life, she one day  runs into Krishna who suffered permanent brain damage from his beating.
