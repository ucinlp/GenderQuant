Several years after the events of A Better Tomorrow, Sung Tse-Ho  is offered early parole by the police in exchange for spying on his former boss and mentor, Lung Sing , who is suspected of heading a counterfeiting operation. Inspector Wu, the leader of the crime task force, wants to mark his retirement with the capture of a high-profile criminal like Lung. Ho, still loyal to Lung, initially declines. However, he changes his mind when he discovers that his younger brother Kit  is working undercover on the same case, and agrees to go undercover to protect his brother, who is expecting a child with his pregnant wife Jackie. While working the case, the two brothers meet and agree to work together on the investigation. After being framed for murder, Lung seeks Ho's help. Ho helps him escape to New York, but Lung suffers a psychotic break and is institutionalized after receiving news of his daughter's murder and witnessing his friend being killed. Meanwhile, Ho learns that Mark Lee has a long-lost twin brother, Ken , a former gang member who went legitimate and left Hong Kong as a teenager to travel across America, eventually settling and opening a restaurant in New York. Ho tracks down Ken and enlists his assistance in freeing Lung and nursing him back to health. Targeted by both assassins hunting for Lung as well as American mobsters looking to extort Ken's business, Ken and Lung  go into hiding in an apartment building, where Ken arms himself. During a shoot-out with the mobsters, Ken and Lung find themselves cornered. Seeing Ken wounded and in trouble, Lung regains his sanity and kills the last of the Americans pursuing them. The two return to Hong Kong and link up with Ho and Kit. The group discovers that one of Lung's employees, Ko Ying-Pui, is responsible for trying to kill Lung and has taken over the organization in Lung's absence. Lung resolves that he would rather destroy his organization by his own hands than let it fall into dishonor and ruin, and the team starts planning to act against Ko. After doing some reconnaissance in Ko's mansion alone, Kit is fatally wounded, roughly at the same time his daughter is born. He is rescued by Ken, who attempts to rush him to the hospital. Knowing that he won't make it, Kit persuades Ken to stop at a phone booth to call his wife. He manages, just before he dies, to name his child Sung Ho-Yin . After attending Kit's funeral, Ho, Ken, and Lung take revenge on Ko by attacking his mansion during a meeting with a counterfeiting client. An enormous gun battle ensues. The three kill approximately 90 others  but are all severely  wounded in the process. The three sit down in the mansion and are eventually surrounded by the police, led by Inspector Wu. Upon seeing the condition of the men, Wu motions to the other officers to lower their weapons. Ho remarks that Inspector Wu shouldn't retire yet as there is "much work left for [him] to do."
