Set in East London, in the shadow of the Olympic site, the story revolves around Bill Hayward , a prisoner of eight years out on parole. Returning home, he finds his two sons, Dean , aged 15, and Jimmy , aged 11, abandoned by their mother and fending for themselves. Dean, who is acting as father to his young brother, forces Bill to stay when social services threaten to put the boys into care. A bond between Bill and Jimmy quickly develops, and Dean gradually comes around to the idea of having his father around. However, their domestic life is short-lived, when Jimmy starts drug-dealing for some local villains.
