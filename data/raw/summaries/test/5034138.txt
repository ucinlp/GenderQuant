Harold Horne, an ambitious shoe salesman in Honolulu, unknowingly meets the boss' secretary  and tells her he is a millionaire leather tycoon. The rest of the film he spends hiding his true circumstances, in the store and later as an  stowaway on board a ship. Trying to deliver a letter, he becomes trapped in a mailbag, which is taken off the ship and falls off a delivery van onto a window cleaner's cradle, which is hoisted upwards. Escaping from the bag, he finds himself dangling high above the street. After several thwarted attempts to get inside the building, he climbs to the very top, only to slip off - unaware his foot is caught on the end of a rope, which rescues him inches from the ground.
