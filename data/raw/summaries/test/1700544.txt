Four angels &mdash; Charlie, Earl, Gonzales, and Ruth &mdash; have been in charge of Heaven for the last 25 years. They are playing a golf match in Heaven when their game is interrupted by God, who has now returned to the office and does not like what he sees down on Earth. God wants to order up another flood and start all over again , but the angels persuade God to reconsider, reasoning that if a typical Earth man can reform, it would prove that all mankind is capable of it. God agrees to the scheme, and the typical Earth man selected by the angels is Zack Melon &mdash; a failed inventor who, threatened by loan sharks, decides to hold up a bank. Zack points his gun at bank teller Debbie Wylder who ostensibly gives him all the money. But when Zack peers into the sack after the robbery, he sees that Debbie has substituted bank deposit slips for the cash and has kept the money for herself. Zack tracks her down to reclaim his stolen money and the two fall in love.
