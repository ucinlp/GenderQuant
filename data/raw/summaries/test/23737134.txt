Captain Augustus "Gus" McCrae  and Captain Woodrow F. Call , two famous former Texas Rangers, run a livery in the small dusty Texas border town of Lonesome Dove. Gus loves women, but he's twice a widower, and Call is somewhat of a workaholic. Working with them are Joshua Deets , a black tracker and scout from their Ranger days, Pea Eye Parker, another former Ranger who works hard but isn't very bright, and Bolivar, a retired Mexican bandit who is their cook. Also living with them is Newt Dobbs , a 17-year-old whose mother was a prostitute named Maggie and whose father may be Call.  The story begins in the small Texas town of Lonesome Dove, as Jake Spoon , a former Texas Ranger and comrade of Gus and Call's, shows up after an absence of more than ten years. He reveals that he is a man on the run, a fugitive, after having accidentally shot the dentist and mayor of Fort Smith, Arkansas in a bar-room gunfight. The dentist/mayor's brother-in-law happens to be the sheriff, July Johnson ([[Chris Cooper . Reunited with Gus and Call, Jake's glowing description of Montana inspires Call to gather a herd of cattle and drive them there, attracted by the notion of settling pristine country. Gus is less enthusiastic, pointing out that they are getting old and that they are Rangers and traders, not cowboys. But he changes his mind when he realises Lonesome Dove has little left to offer him by way of excitement, now that much of the land has been 'civilized'. At the continued insistence of the dentist's widow, Sheriff Johnson sets off in pursuit of Spoon, accompanied by his young step-son, who travels at Elmira's  insistence. Ogallala, Nebraska also happens to be the destination of the pregnant Elmira - and with her new husband gone, she runs away upriver to meet up with her true love, Dee Boot. En route upstream, she soon falls in with a rough gang of buffalo hunters. Meanwhile, the men make preparations for their adventure north, including stealing 2,500 horses and cattle from across the Rio Grande in Mexico, befriending two Irish immigrants, and being joined by nearly all of the male citizens of Lonesome Dove. Before leaving, Gus returns for his livery yard sign and to farewell his pigs, who end up following him anyway. Jake decides not to travel with the herd, mainly because he promises to take the town's only prostitute, Lorie , to San Francisco via Denver. Some time later the group survive a huge dust-storm, but one of the Irish is bitten by water moccasins while crossing the Nueces River.  The young Irishman soon succumbs to his numerous snakebites, dies, and is buried. While travelling through a forest in east Texas, Roscoe, Sheriff Johnson's deputy, is joined by a young girl fleeing from an old abusive "owner". As they travel together they are in the process of being robbed, when luckily Sheriff Johnson happens to catch up with them. Meanwhile, Johnson's wife Elmira arrives by boat at Bent's Fort, Colorado, and sets off overland across the Kansas Plains with two hunters she has befriended. Meanwhile, the camp's cook refuses to continue, and Gus and Call head into San Antonio in search of a new cook. On the way back they catch up with Lorie, who Jake has abandoned in order to go gambling in Austin. Before he returns, Gus and Lorie encounter Blue Duck, a notorious bandit with a deep grudge against Gus and Call. Blue Duck knocks Newt unconscious, kidnaps Lorie, and attempts to sell/barter her to a gang of Comanchero bandits camped near a place called Llano Estacado. Knowing that Gus is in pursuit, Blue Duck asks the Comanchero bandit gang to kill Gus when he arrives - the reward of doing so being Lorie. Gus and the bandits engage in a brief gun battle that quickly turns into a stalemate. Gus, having killed his horse, is pinned down by the bandits' gunfire until nightfall, when Sheriff Johnson's party arrives and scares them off. Sheriff Johnson, despite Gus' protests, agrees to help Gus rescue Lorie, and they ride to a hilltop above the bandit camp to kill the Comancheros. While Gus and Johnson are away, Blue Duck slips in and knifes the remainder of Sheriff Johnson's party , steals their horses, and escapes. After a brief one-sided gunfight, Gus and Lorie, now reunited, ride north to rejoin Call and the herd, leaving Sheriff Johnson alone to bury his dead companions. Lorie, clearly traumatized by her capture, assault and ordeal, now regards Gus as her primary protector. Meanwhile, in a saloon in Fort Worth, and oblivious of Lorie's ordeal, Jake Spoon falls in with a gang of rough-riders.  As they ride through the bush, Spoon and the robbers come across a group of horse wranglers. They shoot most of the wranglers and steal the horses. They then travel to a sodbuster's farm, two of whom the leader kills, hangs, and burns for no apparent reason. Although Spoon disagrees, the gang leader bullies Spoon into submission. When one of the dying wranglers is rescued by the cowboys, Call leads a posse to search for the thieves. Gus and Call quickly capture the robbers and prepare to hang them. With his last words, Jake Spoon admits that it is better to be hanged by his friends than by strangers. By chance, Elmira and the buffalo hunters arrive at the home of Gus' old sweetheart, Clara, near the Platte River in Nebraska. Elmira gives birth to a son, but abandons the child with Clara and goes to Ogallala in search of Dee Boot. She finds Dee Boot in jail, where he is shortly hanged for a murder. Two weeks later, Sheriff Johnson also meets Clara, his son, and Elmira. That night, Elmira secretly departs east for St. Louis with the buffalo hunters, but they are soon killed by the Sioux. Sheriff Johnson returns to Clara's house and is offered a job. Clara, having lost three sons of her own is quite fond of Johnson's newborn son, and names him Martin. Gus and Call's cattle drive also arrives at Ogallala, where they relax and enjoy the town. Some US soldiers attempt to commandeer the group's horses, and beat Newt when he resists, making Call enter a murderous rage. In the aftermath, Newt learns that Call is his father. Clara, although happy to see Gus, and with her husband gravely ill, makes it clear that she will not marry Gus. Instead, she invites Gus to settle and ranch on a piece of nearby property. Further, she invites Lorie to remain with Clara and her daughters, and Gus promises he will return one day to them. Continuing their journey, Gus and Call lead their cattle drive north through the badlands of Wyoming and into Montana Territory. Impoverished Indians soon steal a dozen of their horses for food. Gus, Call, and Deets ride after the horse thieves to retrieve the horses. Call frightens the Indians with a gunshot, and Deets takes pity on a blind Indian child and goes to assist him. Another Indian mistakes his intentions and impales him with a spear. Deets is mortally wounded and dies in Gus's and Call's arms a few moments later.  Deets is buried, then the party continues on across the Powder River, Montana Territory. Meanwhile, Clara's husband finally dies and is buried as well. Leaving the main group to scout ahead with Pea Eye Parker, Gus decides to chase some buffalo, but is chased by mounted Indians and is badly wounded in his right leg. While trying to get help, an exhausted Pea Eye is guided by the ghost of Deets, whereas Gus is found by a stranger and taken 40 miles away to Miles City, Montana. There a doctor amputates Gus' right leg. Gus knows that his left leg is septic and he is likely to die, but refuses to let the doctor remove it. Gus tells Call  to give his money to Lorie, to bury him in Texas, and to admit that Call is Newt's father. Call stores Gus' body in the town over the winter. He then leads the cattle drive to a wilderness lake where the party raises a cabin and a corral. Call honors Gus' wish to be returned to Texas. Just before departing, he gives Newt a pocket-watch that belonged to his own father and states that Newt will run the ranch in his absence. The moment is filled with anticipation, but he is incapable of actually calling Newt his son out loud. Call soon returns to Ogallala. Sheriff Johnson, Clara, Lorie, and the ranch hand Dish live happily together. Dish is enamored with Lorie, but she does not return his affections. When Call brings Gus' body, she stays and mourns by the coffin all night long. Clara asks Call to bury Gus at her home, but Call declines. Clara then berates Call for the bad effect he and Gus had on each other, blaming their adventures as the reason neither of them could find happiness. After a long journey, Call arrives at Santa Rosa, New Mexico Territory, the town where Blue Duck has finally been captured. Call visits Blue Duck in jail, where Blue Duck mocks Call's failure to capture him. While being led to the gallows, Blue Duck grabs a deputy and throws himself out a window, choosing a murder-suicide rather than allow himself to be hanged. Despite blizzards, a broken wagon, and the loss of the coffin, Call finally succeeds in burying Gus after a journey of some three thousand miles. Call weeps for his friend after burying him, the first display of emotion he has allowed himself since Deets' death. After the burial, Call tours Lonesome Dove and discovers that the saloon owner who once employed Lorie was so heartbroken by her departure that he burned down the saloon and killed himself. As Call walks out of town, a reporter recognizes him and tries to interview him about his remarkable feats. Call ignores the reporter's questions, aside from ironically agreeing with him that he was a man of vision, then walks away as the sun sets on Lonesome Dove.
