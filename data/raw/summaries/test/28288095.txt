The film starts with Stella Chernak , who arrives at the Peyton Tower Hotel in Peyton Place after an absence of numerous years. She has returned to destroy the small town, and is able to use her power through Jay Kamens , the president of the Peyton Mills and her trustee. Another former citizen returning to Peyton Place is Betty Anderson . Although she is now married to David Roerick , she agreed to a secret meeting with her ex-husband Rodney Harrington near Peyton Place. Her friend Denise Haley  offers her a roof, despite her husband Stan Haley's  objections about her presence. Another resident dissatisfied with Betty's arrival is Constance MacKenzie , who fears that Betty will interfere with Rodney's relationship with her daughter Allison MacKenzie. Betty sneaks out of the Haley house at night to meet with Rodney somewhere near Peyton Place, but witnesses the Winnebago crashing and exploding in which Rodney and Allison are driving. The town is in deep sorrow when it is revealed that Rodney and Allison have died. Rodney's brother Norman Harrington ([[Christopher Connelly , now married to Jill , refuses to accept that Rodney and Allison have died because of drunk driving, which the police have concluded after finding alcohol in the RV. Along with Betty and lawyer Steven Cord , Norman starts an investigation to find out what really happened on the night when Rodney and Allison died. He is unaware that Jill's family is somehow involved with the origins of the car accident, and her father Bo Buehler  even witnessed the car crash. The research endangers both Steven and Betty's marriage; Steven's wife Carla  suspects that he is somehow involved with Betty after he was out all night, and Betty's husband David does not understand why she is staying in Peyton Place. Betty's marriage is saved; Steven and Carla's fate together remains uncertain. Norman, Betty and Steven eventually conclude that the powerful company New Star Corporation is trying to take over Peyton Place by sabotaging the town's water supply. In the hospital, Constance and her husband Elliot Carson ([[Tim O'Connor  are brought in to identify the bodies. Elliot claims that the girl on the table is not Allison, after which doctor Tommy Crimpton  is held responsible and gets fired by Ellen Considine . Ellen is the secretary and lover of doctor Michael Rossi , who has come to town to hide a dark secret from the past involving her teenage son Andy . Andy feels attracted to Jill's younger sister Bonnie , who in her turn is blackmailed by lovestruck teen Billie Kaiserman  due to her affair with Stan. Meanwhile, Norman hires a musician named Springer  to find out who is the head of New Star Corporation. Springer breaks in its office, and while going through documents, he finds out that Stella is the boss of New Star Corporation, and that two days before their death, Rodney and Allison went through the same documents. Springer tries to warn Norman about this, but he is shot by Stella's servant Tristan  before he can. Hereafter, Stella allows Elliot's request for an inquest, because she is certain that some of the medical examiners hired by her will give the court a false death cause. The examiners were able to interfere due to Crimpton blackmailing Ellen with the information that Andy has spent three years in a hospital for the criminally insane for arsoning. Stella was not aware, though, that Dr. Rossi examined the bodies himself and found out that Rodney and Allison were shot to death. Afterwards, Steven orders a warrant for Stella. Stella is, along with Crimpton and other accomplices, in the Peyton Tower Hotel, where they are keeping Jill as a hostage. Norman receives a threat note to sabotage the inquest if he wants to see his wife ever again. Instead, he and Michael set out to the Peyton Tower Hotel, where they try to stop Stella. It results into a major fight, during which Stella falls to death from the balcony.
