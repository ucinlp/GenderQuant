Imsai Arasan 23am Pulikesi is a comical satire on the Machiavellian politics practiced in the late 18th century. The film is laced with references to present-day happenings in politics, sports and other areas. In a faraway South Indian kingdom of Cholapuram Paalayam the ruler  and queen  are longing for a child, as all their 22 children have died at birth. Little do they know that the queenâ€™s brother Rajaguru Sangilimaayan  is behind the death of their children, as he wants to be the next ruler. But when the palace astrologer predicts that the 23rd child will be a dimwit, Rajguru is happy. But the queen gives birth to twins; the smarter one  is ordered to be killed while the dimwit survives. The child is named 23 am Pulikesi  and he grows up to be the new king after the king's death. Pulikesi is a weak, hedonistic bully with grandiose delusions and is a puppet in the hands of Rajguru, who colludes with the British to loot the state. Meanwhile, the other child is adopted by the palace doctor  and his wife, a childless couple and he grows up to be Ugrabuddhan , an educated young man and a patriot with a lofty vision for his country. Ugrabuddhan tries to kill Pulikesi, but when Ugran sees him he realizes that Pulikesi is his twin brother. Soon Ugrabuddhan comes to know about his past and to save the land from Rajguru and British, he replaces Pulikesi as the king. He joins hands with Thalapathi , brings new reforms, exposes Rajguru and saves the land from the British.
