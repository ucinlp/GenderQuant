19-year-old student Katrin is thrilled to be on her own at last, far from her overprotective father and traumatic past. But when strange things begin to happen in her dorm room, No. 205, she starts to understand why no one rented it since the mysterious disappearance of its former occupant a year ago. Increasingly frightened, she feels that her predecessor was murdered, and that her ghost wants revenge.http://www.bavaria-film-international.de/htmls/bfi/index.php?site300
