Mr. Proudfoot is an attention-seeking bore who subjects his long-suffering wife and exasperated acquaintances to endless tall tales about narrow escapes from bombs. He also teases the local blackout warden for his ridiculous pettiness when it comes to enforcing blackout restrictions. One night Mr. Proudfoot is careless about his blackout, and the light showing from his home provides a target for a stray German bomber plane. Having unloaded a bomb over Mr. Proudfoot's district, the pilots are shot down by the RAF, and under interrogation state that they were guided to their target by a light blazing from a property. Mr. Proudfoot is shown bandaged and bruised in hospital, still boasting to anyone who will listen about his latest brush with death.
