Malachy McKinny is a straight-A teenager working at the Titanic Leisureplex, a sports training complex owned and run by Dave. His best friend is Luke, a drug dealer living with his drug-addicted father. While at work, Malachy catches sight of Dave having sex with a young female employee of Titanic Leisureplex, Donna. The two boys find themselves entranced by Michelle, a beautiful and charismatic teen who moved from London to live with her father, Dave. Luke and Malachy attempt to win Michelle's affections by outdoing each other on a wild ride of sex, drugs, vandalism, shoplifting, and fighting. However, all three teens find that they are in over their heads when they throw a party in the Titanic Leisureplex, which turns disastrous when Dave walks in to find his place trashed. Blaming Malachy, he almost beats him to death, Malachy is saved by Luke who smacks Dave over the head with a pole. Stunned, Dave slowly turns to look at Luke, and receives a second blow to the head, while Malachy is covered in blood and bruises he gets up and tells Luke that he does not want to leave, since Michelle is grieving for her dead father. Luke, being a "supportive" friend stays with Malachy until the paramedics and police show up and take them in for questioning. The ending of the film turns out to be the opening sequence to the movie, although we only see bits and pieces of the ending interrogation, the audience gets to hear of Malachy's and Luke's final words on the incident before the movie cuts out. http://www.flixster.com/movie/cherrybomb-2009
