The film is set in rural Québec in the 1830s. Élisabeth is at the deathbed of her second husband Jérôme recounting her past, conveyed through a series of flashbacks; her first marriage to Antoine, the brutish Seigneur of Kamouraska, and her ensuing love affair with a loyalist American doctor George Nelson which leads to the brutal murder of Antoine, her trial for complicity and acquittal, her loveless marriage to Jérôme to save her honour.
