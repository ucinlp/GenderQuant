After 29 years of marriage, Alberto  and his socialite frau, Natalie , have little to say to each other. While on summer vacation at their ranch, Alberto suddenly notices a fluffy white sheep and has his overseer, Miranda , put it in the barn. That night, overcome with lust, he gives in to an urgent desire to visit "Fanny." Natalie begins to notice a funny smell on Alberto's clothes and accidentally witnesses his showdown with the overseer, who has also noticed the sheep's attractiveness. But unlike the lustful Miranda, Alberto is deeply in love with Fanny. In a delicate scene full of ambiguous nuances, he tries to teach her to pronounce his name, recognizing what he wants to hear in her inarticulate bleating. He becomes mortally jealous of a black ram and finally stages a marriage ceremony on the lawn to cement his love. Alberto ruthlessly eliminates all those who refuse to understand his feelings, and story slips into blood-soaked horror mode.
