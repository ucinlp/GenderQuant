In New York in 1937, 17-year-old Richard Samuels  meets theatre director Orson Welles , who unexpectedly offers him the role of Lucius in Julius Caesar, Broadway's first Shakespearean production, at the Mercury Theatre. Welles is having an affair with the leading actress while his wife is pregnant. Richard finds ambitious production assistant Sonja Jones  is attracted to him. Welles tells Richard a few days before the premiere that he is worried, because he has recently had nothing but good luck; he fears that he will finally have bad luck with the premiere, and that the play will be a flop. During rehearsals Richard accidentally sets off the sprinkler system, soaking the entire theatre. When accused by Welles he suggests that the catastrophe was the bad luck that Welles needed to get out of the way. Welles decides the entire production crew would benefit from a coupling game, and Richard cheats to ensure he is paired with Sonja. Richard spends the night with Sonja, but becomes jealous when she spends the next night with Welles. He confronts Welles, mentions his pregnant wife, and is fired. An apparent reconciliation follows, and Richard performs on the first night. The anti-fascist adaptation of Caesar is a huge success, but Richard is told Welles only needed him for the premiere and, that done, he has again been fired. The broken-hearted but wiser Richard finds a new girlfriend, a young aspiring playwright whom he met in a music store at the film's beginning.<ref name http://www.gov.im/dti/iomfilm/PastProductions/2008/meandorsonwelles.xml |title  2008-05-30 |year  Government of the Isle of Man}}
