A large, dysfunctional family is brought together for a surprise birthday party for patriarch Jack Scanlan and for the funeral that follows, Jack dying from a heart attack from the surprise. Everybody's assorted issues are brought to light. There is eldest son Johnny, a tree surgeon who wants more adventure in his life. There is his brother Frank, a labor leader who wants to live up to his father's expectations. There is sister Tracy, a dancer, her gay ex-husband Boyd and the embalmer Peter who is in love with her. There is a literal sister, Nora, a nun based in Latin America. And there are unfamiliar faces, too, like a woman named Cassie who turns up at the funeral and may or may not have been their late father's mistress. It's a chance for everyone to get acquainted or reacquainted and it's all in the family.
