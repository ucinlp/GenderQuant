Bruno Rygseck, a rich, hated and lecherous playboy living in Helsinki, is found dead in his swimming pool, supposedly dead by accidental causes, after hosting a crime-themed party. After hearing the account of the events from Veijonen, the dead Rygseck's butler, Inspector Palmu becomes convinced that a murder has been committed. The investigation is eventually shut down when Palmu annoys Eerik Vaara, an engineer working for Rygseck's uncle. The case is reopened when Alli Rygseck, Bruno's soon-to-have-been-divorced wife, is killed suddenly by means of Prussic acid in a glass of absinthe.
