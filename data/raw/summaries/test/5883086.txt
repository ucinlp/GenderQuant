A group of dancers congregate on the stage of a Broadway theatre to audition for a new musical production directed by Zach . After the initial eliminations, sixteen hopefuls remain. Arriving late is former lead dancer Cassie  who once had a tempestuous romantic relationship with Zach but left him to take a job in Hollywood. Now she hasn't worked in over a year, and is desperate enough for work to even just be part of the chorus line and audition for him; whether he's willing to let professionalism overcome his personal feelings about their past remains to be seen. As the film unfolds, the backstory of each of the dancers is revealed. Some are funny, some ironic, some heartbreaking. No matter what their background, however, they all have one thing in common - a passion for dance.
