Christmas card salesman Stan and Ollie are persuaded to help a woman  spice up her loveless marriage by making her husband jealous. The spouse involved, a temperamental artist played by , is however made rather too jealous for comfort, and puts Ollie in peril when he challenges him to a duel to the death at midnight and pledges to track him "to the end of the world" if he does not show up. Stan and Ollie discuss the challenge in a nearby bar and it occurs to them that the husband cannot know where they live, so Ollie complacently telephones him to inform him he will not be there and they both insult him. They then get drunk with a neighbor of the couple . The police are called and finding the artist's business card with his home address in Ollie's pocket, they take them to the couples apartment and dump them on their bed to sleep it off. They are discovered when Stan starts snoring and pistols are produced but the wife tells Ollie she has replaced the bullets with blanks. The husband shoots at Ollie, who plays dead and the pair then run for their lives and manage to give him the slip. The film ends with Ollie sighing to the camera from the back of a horse-drawn garbage truck, after having hidden in a trash can.
