{{Plot}} Avery Montgomery  is taking time off from college to spend time with his girlfriend Krista , help raise their young son. Despite the lack of black swimmers, Avery develops to a championship level, and as a result of a particularly impressive win he gets the opportunity for a possible scholarship. Cashmere , happens to be one of Avery's best friends since childhood. Despite the fact that their personalities and lifestyles are quite different, Avery being a levelheaded straightedge that stays out of trouble. The trio have been friends since childhood. Earlier in the day before the swim meet, Cashmere had a run-in with Broadway, another dealer who works under Cashmere in the hierarchy. Cashmere is expected to bring back five $10 rocks. $50 is also expected or else he gets beat up or killed. Broadway happened to be short in his return and it angered Cashmere, who proceeds to knock out Broadway, kick him down a flight of metal stairs, and pulls out a gun to assert his power. Broadway, knowing he can't fight a gun, gives up and runs off, but vows to get revenge and, after an attempted robbery later in the day where he shoots and kills a young girl at a drive through, he wipes off the gun and tosses it into the backseat of Cashmere's open convertible when he is out of the car, which looks similar enough to his for a mistaken identity case. After the swim meet, Cashmere and Dre, who were there to cheer him on, convince Avery to come out and celebrate his big victory with them but he just wants to spend some time with Krista instead. However, she tells him to go out and he changes his mind before hops in the car and they drive off. At a certain point, Dre, who is riding in the backseat, finds the gun, and questions Cashmere about violating their unwritten rule. Cashmere has no idea what he is talking about, and the three men realize that they have a strange gun, in their possession, and had no idea where it came from and what it could have been used for. As they were arguing over how to get rid of it, some cops who spotted them and, thinking their car looked similar to Broadway's car, came up behind them and pulled them over. One of them, a female officer, orders them out of the car at gunpoint, which they comply to, but a few moments later Cashmere's pitbull runs toward the officer, who shoots him dead, in self defense. Cashmere pulls out his gun in anger, and manages to cock it and point it at the officer before being shot in the shoulder and knocked down. After being convicted in court of unnamed charges, the three are sent to the same medium security prison while serving a life sentence. Each man experiences different events: Cashmere, who beats up and threatens his cellmate, Dre who gets raped and turned to a prison sex slave by his cellmate named Graffiti , who controls much of the prison's drug flow and is the leader of a neo-nazi gang, and Avery has a cellmate who is a man named Malachi Young  who is in jail for 18  and tries to take his anger out on him just like Cashmere but Malachi has the upper hand and pins him against the door before warning him that if he's bringing conflict to the cell, he's bringing it to him. Graffiti's rival, Clean Up  is another drug trafficker who Cashmere began to work for. Meanwhile, Charles Pierce, the College Scout who Avery met on his fateful night, also happened to be an accomplished lawyer and knew without being told that Avery was wrongfully convicted and decided to help his release efforts. Avery was resentful and resistant at first, towards both Pierce and Krista  but eventually accepted both their visitations and that they could only help. Graffiti finds two drug shells that he got from his two bisexual girlfriends in his cell toilet and he along with his gang are back in business but a corrupt guard named Perez warns them not to retaliate against Clean Up's gang. Graffiti and the gang kill Nuke anyway to which his dead body is found in the prison laundry room, and the warden orders a lockdown for 24 hours while on the next night, Dre tries to resist Graffiti but is overpowered and is raped by force of oral sex. One day, Dre shoots up heroin comes back to his cell to find an angry Graffiti waiting for him to return. Dre tries to strangle Graffiti while eventually starting to build some resistance. Graffiti, who's twice his size, eventually gets the upper hand back and starts to beat him up bad. Then Avery who happened to be on his way to see Dre, despite Malachi's warnings not to  sees him getting beat to death and jumps in to protect him. Avery, who is strong, muscular and Graffiti's size, jumps on him and beats him to a pulp, but not before a bunch of Graffiti's guys jump on Avery and Malachi has to save him, beating up several of them and throwing one over the second floor railing onto a table. Malachi, Avery, Graffiti, Dre and the others involved had to go to a disciplinary hearing, in which Malachi, in the ultimate act of unselfishness and sacrifice, after being allowed to go in first, even though he has almost nothing to do with most the incident, takes responsibility for the entire thing to spare Avery a dirty discipline record and assault charge, and then in an unexplained and unnecessary move, flies into a rage in front of the board, screaming and throwing chairs around the room and getting shipped out to a maximum security prison for his actions but at this point, Avery has gleaned enough that he can now be solo like Malachi and it won't be a huge loss for him. Avery then gets a new cellmate who tries the same greeting to Avery and Avery gives him the same response he got from Malachi and he becomes his mentor. As the three friends move in their separate directions, they eventually get further and further apart. Cashmere grows under the protection and connections of Clean Up, even if in a negative way, and continues to sell for him. Avery grows under Malachi  who teaches him how to deal with being locked down and despite some setbacks, he adjusts relatively well. Dre is the worst off, being repeatedly raped by Graffiti. He starts to go on a mental and physical downslide, including, as an escape, continuing to shoot the heroin he got as a so called "perk" of selling it for Graffiti, getting addicted beyond the point of no return, and eventually, Clean Up, who, like all prison traffickers, is looking to eliminate his rival and for somebody to do the dirty work, bribes the now-junkie into stabbing him to death for a bag. While he was in the middle of his murderous frenzy, Perez hits Dre so hard with his nightstick that he crushes his skull and kills him. Meanwhile, somebody has been snitching and busting Clean Up's drug mules and he comes to the conclusion that Avery is the snitch  but he assumes anyways and wants Cashmere to take care of him. During a riot in the prison yard , Cashmere goes up to Avery and stabs him. Avery fights through the stab wound and tries to fight Cashmere off for his life. Cleanup, seeing he's not doing the proper job, stabs Cashmere in the back and tries to kill Avery himself. As he is now fighting off Cleanup, Cashmere, who still had love for Avery despite their differences inside, comes up behind Clean Up and stabs him to death. Avery, after a minute of wondering if he could still trust him, realizes that it was all in the game and even though he didn't see the Broadway letter yet, realized inside that Cashmere  didn't do anything either after all. Meanwhile, a guard named Barkley tries to order Cashmere to drop the shank. Cashmere, either because he somehow didn't hear it or just out of spite, keeps holding it. Just as he and Avery are about to embrace, a guard unloads a shot into his back on Barkley's order, killing him instantly. Prison Officials get to Avery before anything else can potentially happen and he gets released into the waiting arms of Krista and his son, who he lives happily ever after with.
