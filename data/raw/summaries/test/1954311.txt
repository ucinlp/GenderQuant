{{plot}}  December 24, 1971, Salt Lake City, Utah: Billy Chapman, a little boy, goes with his parents and younger brother Ricky to see their grandfather for Christmas at a mental institution. Billy's grandfather is sitting in a catatonic state, when Billy's parents go off to review his records with the doctor, leaving him alone with Billy. Grandpa starts talking to Billy, and tells him the frightening "truth" about Santa Claus: Santa not only gives presents to the good boys and girls, but punishes the naughty ones. This begins the themes of being naughty and punishment, linking these things to Santa Claus. As soon as the parents return, Grandpa goes back into his catatonic state. Afterwards, the family leaves the mental hospital. Not far away, a man in a Santa Claus suit goes to a convenience store and robs it at gun point. He kills the clerk and runs out of the store. Later that night, the Chapman family are on their way home and see the same man in the Santa suit pulled over at the side of the road. When they ask him if he needs help, he pulls out a gun. Billy's dad puts the car in reverse and tries to get away, but the man shoots him and pulls his mother out of the car leaving his brother behind. Billy gets out of the car and hides. When he sees the killer rips his mother's blouse open and try to rape her, he looks away. Baby Ricky remains in the car crying and his mother resists and he slits her throat. When Billy looks up, the killer is gone. 1974: Billy and his brother are living at St. Mary's Orphanage staffed by Catholic Religious Sisters. Billy is in class, and the kids have been assigned to draw Christmas pictures. When Billy shows his drawing of a bloody Santa Claus and a decapitated reindeer to the Sister that is teaching, she sends Billy to Mother Superior. She sees the drawing and sends Billy to his room as punishment. Sister Margaret, one of the nicer Sisters, can see that Billy still is haunted by his parents' deaths. Mother Superior does not care what Sister Margaret thinks, and tells her that she will take care of Billy personally, planning to increase his sadistic discipline. Later on, Sister Margaret lets Billy come outside to play. As Billy leaves his room, he hears the noise of an older boy and girl having sex. Mother Superior sees it and beats them with a belt. When she comes out she is angry at Billy for both seeing this sexual activity and leaving his room to begin with. She tells Billy that what the older kids were doing was "Very Naughty" and they thought they could do it, without getting caught. She then said "When we do something naughty, we are always get caught and then we are punished." She also said that "Punishment is absolute, punishment is necessary, punishment is good," then she tells him that leaving his room was naughty and then brings Billy there and beats him with a belt. A couple nights later, Billy has nightmares about Santa and runs out of his room, only to be caught by Mother Superior, who then ties him to his bed. Then on Christmas morning, when the kids line up to sit on Santa Claus's lap, Billy is forced to join in, but he wiggles away and punches the fake Santa and runs to his room, scared as Mother Superior comes in. He is presumably punished. It is presumed this treatment continued for many more years. 1984: Billy is now 18 years old and Sister Margaret is trying to help him get a job at Ira's Toy Store. He meets Mr. Simms, the store owner, who hires Billy. Things go well until Christmas. Billy's co-worker, Andy, starts yelling at him for poor job performance and he claims Billy was an alright kid at first, but now he is giving him attitude, snapping at him and staring off into space. Billy has a crush on his female co-worker, Pamela, and has a dream about making love to her, but being stabbed for his acts. Billy gets scared when he sees the store Santa after he was yelled at again by Andy. The next day, Billy is asked to play Santa Claus because one of his fellow employees was injured. A little girl gets scared to sit on Billy's lap as he is Santa, but Billy says stop it, she is being naughty, he does not bring presents to naughty children and he punishes them severely. Sister Margaret calls the store managers at the store and asks how Billy is doing. When she is told by the store managers that Billy is now the store Santa Claus, she hangs the phone up looking frightened. Later that night, when the employees are celebrating Christmas, Andy takes Pamela back to the stock room. When Billy goes to the room a few minutes later and sees Andy attempt to rape Pamela, he has flashbacks of his parents. Billy snaps, thinking that he has the power to punish, since he is now Santa Claus, declares "Naughty!" and hangs Andy by the Christmas lights. Pamela becomes upset and starts yelling at Billy, who stabs Pamela saying "Punishment is necessary Pamela, Punishment is good." Mr. Simms hears the noise in back and checks it out, thinking he is hallucinating in his intoxication. When he turns around, he is hit in the head with a hammer claw. The assistant manager, Mrs. Randall, sees the lights turned off and goes to look for Mr. Simms in the stock room. When she sees his corpse, she becomes hysterical and tries to call the police, but the phone line is cut. She sees Billy with an axe in his hand and tries to hide. When Billy comes closer, she knocks him down and tries to escape by breaking the window glass with the axe. Billy picks up a bow and arrow and kills her. Having killed everyone in the store, Billy leaves to go punish the "naughty people". When Sister Margaret comes to see Billy, she sees Mrs. Randall's corpse and screams. Later, Billy sees two young adults having sex. The girl, Denise, hears something upstairs. Thinking the cat wants to come in, she opens the door. She sees that Billy is there. He shouts "Punish!", then impales her on the antlers of an antelope head hanging on the wall. The boy goes to look for her and sees her hanging her on the wall. He tries to call the police, but Billy stops him and throws him out the window. A little girl sees Billy at the door in his Santa Claus outfit. He asks her if she has been naughty or nice. When she says that she has been good, Billy kindly gives her the box cutter he used to kill Pamela as a Christmas present, then leaves. The police are on the look out for Santa and nearly shoot a dad dressed as Santa going in his daughter's window. Billy goes through the forest as he hears police sirens. Later on, two kids going sledding are attacked by two bullies. While one slides down the hill, Billy cuts one of the bullies' head off and hits the other with the ax killing him as well. On Christmas morning, Captain Richards tells Sister Margaret there have been three more murders, in addition to at least five they know of. Margaret tells the captain that there is an order to the killings, and realizes that Billy is the killer. Sister Margaret understands there is a connection after what he has been through during his childhood, while Richards thinks Billy is insane but not stupid. She quickly deduces that his next attack will be at the orphanage. At the orphanage, the children are waiting to see Santa Claus. Mother Superior is in a wheelchair now due to an unknown illness and asks the children to write thank you notes to Santa. The police are looking for Santa and are ordered to shoot and kill if necessary. A man in a Santa suit walks up to the orphanage. Officer Barnes arrives and tells the man to stop. He ignores Barnes and continues walking toward the orphanage. When the police shoots him, the kids panic. The Captain and Sister Margaret think it is over until the dispatcher tells them the report is all wrong. Sister Margaret realizes too late that the police shot Father O'Brien, who did not stop because he was deaf. Officer Barnes unsuccessfully attempts to explain what happened to Mother Superior. She becomes angry at what happened and leaves. Barnes walks off to search the grounds. When he sees an open door that leads to the basement, he goes down to look and finds nothing. However, when he gets back to the door, he hears "Punish!". Billy steps around the corner and slams his axe into Barnes' stomach. Billy starts walking toward the orphanage. One of the kids sees him and lets him in against Mother Superior's orders to keep him out, since she knows Billy will kill her as revenge for abusing him. As Billy is about to kill Mother Superior, she then tells the children "There is no Santa Claus." Billy frowns, says "Naughty!", and begins to swing his axe, but Richards shoots him. Although he killed many people, Sister Margaret is sad to see Billy die. Before he passes, Billy says, "You're safe now... Santa Claus... is gone." Billy's little brother Ricky, who watched Billy die, looks down at his dead brother's body, then slowly looks up with a cold stare towards Mother Superior and bitterly says, "Naughty...".
