A career bank robber, Jack Foley , and a U.S. Marshal, Karen Sisco , are forced to share her car trunk during Foley's escape from a Florida prison. After he completes his getaway, Sisco chases Foley while he and his friends—his right-hand man, Buddy , and their unreliable associate, Glenn —work their way north to Bloomfield Hills, a wealthy northern suburb of Detroit. There they plan to pay a visit to shady businessman Ripley , who foolishly bragged to them years before about a cache of uncut diamonds hidden in his home. A vicious criminal named Maurice Miller  who also spent time in jail with Jack and Ripley is planning on hitting up Ripley's mansion with his own crew, including Kenneth  and White Boy Bob . A romantic interlude between Foley and Sisco takes place in a Detroit hotel, but the question of whether she is really pursuing Foley to arrest him or for love ends in a showdown during the robbery and adds to "the fun" Foley claims they are having.
