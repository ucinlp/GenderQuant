Louise  works as a waitress in a Chinese restaurant in the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce neighborhood of Montreal where she lives, has become obsessed with the story of a recent spate of serial murders committed in the NDG area, and scours Montreal newspapers for stories about each victim. The latest victim is a co-worker who last spoke of a blond, muscular man she meet at the bar, and with whom she had a drink after she got off work at midnight. Louise's wheelchair-bound downstairs neighbor Spencer  shares her predilection up to a point, but mostly likes to keep to himself. Then a young elementary school teacher, Victor , moves into the building, having recently returned to the city from a sojourn in China. The three live on separate floors. Victor eagerly wants to make friends with Louise and Spencer, who are reluctant to form a friendship with him as they find him only slightly more agreeable than the drunken, foul-mouthed tenant Valérie , who hates Louise’s cats. As the trio’s relationships develop, it becomes apparent that each is a troubled character. Louise’s life is focused more on her cats, Mozart and Tia Maria, than to humans. Victor is almost a benign stalker, keen to ingratiate himself with the other tenants, especially Louise, upon whom he appears to develop a crush, inventing an imaginary love life. Spencer appears the most well-adjusted of the three, despite his handicap. As the walls are paper-thin, it is hard to keep secrets in this apartment complex. However its manager, Madame Gauthier , finds herself completely in the dark when a murder takes place in the building.
