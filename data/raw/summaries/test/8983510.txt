In the early episodes Otaru, Lime, Bloodberry and Cherry are shown leading comparatively ordinary lifestyles, cherishing the peaceful days that dawn on Japoness. As the story progresses, due to uncanny circumstances, Faust appears once again, much more zealous, brutal and merciless than before, restarting his world-conquering agenda. He is accompanied by his subordinates, the Saber dolls. He is revealed to be a clone of the now introspective, atonement-seeking Faust, the embodiment of a measure taken by Gartland to secure the aspirations of Faust the First. Later on, as Japoness stirs, more, and even much more sinister and ulterior motives are revealed, and the joint efforts, and investigations lead to the conclusion that Yan of Xian and Dr. Hesse, the former scientist and servant of Faust both have a hand in the matter. They successfully kidnap the Marionettes and out of pure incidence, they make them lose their memories for a prolonged period, which they use for their own gains later on. The series concerns itself with the return of the Marionettes' memories extensively. Yan also, but particularly Hesse are shown in-depth only in the end, showing their personal goals and past traumas, which will lead to the one last arc, an epic resolution to the man-machine conflict, with morals of technology and human responsibility.
