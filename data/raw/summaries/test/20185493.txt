Bert  is a retired Hollywood actor who has been estranged from his only daughter Marie ([[Tracy Nelson  for many years. When she ends up in the hospital following a car accident, Social Services places her 10-year-old daughter, Becca , with the grandfather she has never met. The generation gap is apparent as Bert and Becca try to adjust to their new lives together. In taking in the granddaughter, he never knew about, he is faced with the resentment toward him due to these stories told by the grandmother. Bert is faced with the dilemma of whether to tell his granddaughter, and later his daughter, the truth, which if they believe him, may ruin their memory of the late grandmother, or stay quiet. The dilemma is resolved when one of Bertâ€™s friends tells the mother the truth.
