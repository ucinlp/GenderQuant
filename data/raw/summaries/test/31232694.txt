The official synopsis for Cloud Atlas describes the film as: {{quote}} The film consists of six interrelated and interwoven stories that take the viewer from the South Pacific in the nineteenth century to a distant, post-apocalyptic future. Unlike the original novel, the film is structured, according to novelist David Mitchell, "as a sort of pointillist mosaic: We stay in each of the six worlds just long enough for the hook to be sunk in, and from then on the film darts from world to world at the speed of a plate-spinner, revisiting each narrative for long enough to propel it forward."David Mitchell, Translating 'Cloud Atlas' Into the Language of Film, Wall Street Journal, October 19, 2012.
