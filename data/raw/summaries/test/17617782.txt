A week from the end of high school, Andy is keenly anticipating his graduation, but is putting more effort into running the various student committees - most of which he chairs - than studying for his examinations. On his father's advice, he attempts to offload some of the work, and asks Kathryn Land  to be his private secretary, much to the chagrin of his steady girlfriend Polly Benedict . Kathryn's brother Harry  takes on the task of designing decorations for the graduation ceremony. The father, a down-on-his-luck international travel expert, is helped by Judge Hardy's connections in the US State Department to find a better job. Andy is devastated when he miserably fails his English examination, which means he cannot graduate. He admits his failure to the class and resigns from all committee work. Andy's attempt to help his friends attend commencement results in another disaster â€” the father's job offer is rescinded.
