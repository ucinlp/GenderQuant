Pundarikudu  is from a pious Brahmin family who is not interested in the worship of God and irreligious, a complete rebel who is asked to mend his ways by his parents . He steals their gold for a prostitute Kalavathy . His mother takes the blame, and they part ways. Kalavathy takes all his wealth and throws him out. He goes to a hermitage where he falls in love with three disciples of the Sage, who break his legs for this blasphemy. He then realizes the importance of his parents, goes back to them, begs for forgiveness, and prays to Lord Panduranga to grant him the boon of merging into him along with his parents &mdash; giving the message that one has to serve one's parents and it is the quickest way to Salvation.
