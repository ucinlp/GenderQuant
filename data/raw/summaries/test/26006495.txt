A beautiful but disturbed young woman lives alone at a beach cottage, reliving her past, a tissue of delusions and lies. Lou Andreas Sand  is a former fashion model whose life has gone into a downward spiral including drug use and a nervous breakdown. She tells an acquaintance, Aaron Reinhardt , her story for a film he is planning on her, but the details do not ring true. Lou evidently had a lover who abused her and a penchant for sex with strange men. Along the way, she became engaged to marry Mark , an ad executive, but apparently jilted him on the day of their wedding, leading to her descent into drugs and an attempted suicide.
