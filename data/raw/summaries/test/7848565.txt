In the 1850s, gold miners in Victoria are upset at the conditions under which they work. Things get militant after the murder of miner James Scobie by James Bentley goes unpunished. The miners riot and burn down Bentley's hotel. They form the Ballarat Reform League and Peter Lalor emerges as their leader. Lalor and the miners arm themselves and make camp at the Eureka Stockade. The rebellion is overpowered by the English army. Many of the miners are killed and Lalor is inured, ultimately having to have his arm amputated. However the reforms wanted by the miners are ultimately pushed through and Lalor is elected to Parliament.
