Episode 1: Three Irish men who play in a band in pubs and call themselves Stoisis - "The first punk-folk band in Ireland" - are sitting having pints after a concert, when Frank Murphy reveals that every Friday night for the past three weeks when he is walking home he sees a black goat which talks to him, but he doesn't know what it's saying. So Frank takes Puca and Ciaran to the scene and they too see the goat. After deciding that the creature must be possessed, Ciaran kills it with an axe, prompting The Devil to appear, asking "Why did youse kill my goat?" He asks them to play him a song and if he likes it, he will not burn their souls in the ditches of Hell. The first episode, and the ones to follow  all take the same form. They open with Puca Ryder seated at a bar, who tells the stories of the episodes to the viewer in exchange for drinks of whiskey. Once he is furnished with a drink the story begins. At the end, the action returns to Puca in the pub who gives a summary of some form, and insists that his stories are all true. He then asks for another whiskey, prompting the next episode.
