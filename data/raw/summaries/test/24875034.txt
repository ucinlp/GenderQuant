The Potts family includes father Joe , mother Sally , teenagers Paul  and Paula , young children Olivia  and Karl , and the Potts’s part-time lodger, Magic . On the day of Olivia’s Communion, the family is prepared for a large celebration, for which they have arranged a party in a local social club and ornamented Olivia with electrically powered angel wings. As Joe gets drunk and his attempts to enliven the social atmosphere with jokes and banter fall flat, the cracks in the family’s relationships are revealed: Sally wonders whether she is still beautiful or appreciated; Paula, who throughout the film talks out loud to and continually confers with her imaginary friend Georgina, worries over the news that her beloved boyfriend DJ Worm  is planning to move to Ibiza without telling her; Magic tries to console her while suppressing his obvious attraction to Paula. When Paula is entrusted with taking Olivia and Karl back to the family home, the film takes more turns for the dramatic. Paula suspects she might be pregnant and desperately attempts to find DJ Worm. As Paula is out of the house, Olivia and Karl steal a car and go for a joyride. Magic becomes frustrated in his attempts to steer Paula towards level-headedness and find the missing children. At the social club, Joe and Sally find their relationship strained to the breaking point by both their own failure to communicate and by the charms of local gangster One Dig , who dated Sally years ago and is still willing to offer her a wedding ring. The film builds to a climax in which Magic is forced to confront his true feelings for Paula, Paula herself has to confront the way she is living her life, and Joe and Sally are forced to decide whether they will commit to each other or break apart their family. Along the way there are numerous larger-than-life moments, including a slapstick car chase, another chase involving mobile airplane steps and a taxi driver who claims to be clairvoyant.
