He then learns that she is none other than Geetha's mother.He also invites Geetha's mother Rajarajeswari to his marriage. At that time he calls chiranjeevi and tells him that during his marriage there are rowdies to stop this marriage, he requests him to look after the rowdies and Kanaal comes and fights off the goons and wishes them for their marriage and he goes.He marries Geetha against her mother's wishes. Rajarajeswari vows to separate Geetha from him while he vows to prevent that and make Rajarajeswari understand that love and affection are more important than money.Which is an important message delivered to the audience. The one-on-one confrontations between Rajnikanth and Srividya are the highpoints of the movie and each of these has been handled superlatively. Rajnikanth bristles with energy during their meetings and Srividya is suitably haughty and hits all the right notes. Their first encounter in her house, their private conversation immediately after the wedding and their talk in the garden before the climax in the house all reveal excellent execution by the director.
