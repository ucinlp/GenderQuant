Following the loss of his mother in a car crash, T.J  falls into a state of depression. He and his pill popping father Paul  live with T.J.'s elderly grandmother Madeleine . T.J. is emotionally attached to the wrecked car, follows it to the garage when it is towed away. Chased away from the garage by Dustin, a school bully, T.J. falls off his bicycle and angrily breaks a window of a house under construction. This disturbs a squatting resident named Hesher , who threatens T.J., but when a cop arrives, Hesher tosses an explosive out the window and flees. After school, Dustin finds his car vandalized by an obscene drawing. Dustin assumes T.J. did it and goes after him. Nicole  defends T.J. and gives him a ride home where, to his surprise, Hesher walks in and makes himself at home. Later that night during dinner, Madeleine remarks she would like T.J. to walk with her, and T.J. responds that he has to attend school. Hesher, irritated by T.J.'s defiance, states in his usual vulgar manner that a walk with his grandmother is more important than school. The next day at school, Dustin attacks T.J.. Hesher appears, but he does not defend him. After school, Paul takes T.J. to group therapy in an attempt to help them through the loss of T.J.'s mother. T.J. confronts Hesher about not intervening in the bathroom earlier that day. In response, they go to Dustin's house where Hesher sets Dustin's car on fire and leaves without T.J. The next morning, the police arrive to bring T.J. in for questioning, but no subsequent charges are filed due to lack of evidence. The following day, T.J. goes to the supermarket where Nicole works. After Nicole has finished her shift, Hesher and T.J. follow her in Hesher's van, until she hits another vehicle in a rear-end collision. Hesher scares off the other driver by pinning the blame on him, and subsequently offers a ride to Nicole because her car is broken. Once in the van, Hesher takes Nicole and T.J. to "his uncle's" house and the three swim. Once there, Hesher vandalizes the place and leaves suddenly. T.J. and Nicole walk back to Nicole's car, which has a parking ticket. Later that night, T.J. and Paul get into an argument over dinner. Madeleine is saddened that there is 'nothing she can do', and goes to her room. Hesher teaches her how to smoke her medical marijuana from a bong, and promises to go on a walk with her in the morning. However, she dies early the next morning. T.J. uses Paul's credit card to withdraw money from his account, and tries to use it to buy the wrecked car back, but the owner of the garage tells him that the car is gone. T.J. goes to Nicole's apartment to give her the stolen money to help pay her parking ticket, but hears Hesher and Nicole having sex. T.J. is jealous, attacks both Hesher and his van, and rides off on his bike. He goes back to the house, and destroys all of Hesher's possessions, and takes a pair of cutting shears. T.J. goes to Dustin's house, where he threatens to cut off Dustin's toes if he does not tell where the wrecked car is. Dustin tells him that it is in the junk yard, and pins T.J. to the ground. However, Hesher arrives and cuts his nose with the shears. T.J. then goes to the junkyard to sit in the wrecked car and falls asleep in the back seat, dreaming of the car collision that killed his mother. The next morning, as the car is picked up and ready to be crushed, T.J. falls through the windshield. A few hours later, T.J. and Paul attend Madeleine's funeral, at which time Hesher tells a story about losing a testicle, but that he later was happy with his other testicle and penis being intact. Since he promised to walk with Madeleine he wheels her casket outside and down the road, an emotional T.J. and Paul join him. The next day, Paul shows T.J. the compacted remains of his mother's car that Hesher had procured from the junkyard and placed in the driveway. Hesher has disappeared, after painting on their roof "Hesher was here."
