Maggie Rohrer  is a seductive con-artist scamming the rich in Miami Beach. When she picks the wrong mark, Jack Shanks , he blackmails her into working with him on the ultimate scam in Jamaica. He wants to use her talents in a much-bigger scam: ripping off a crime lord by getting at his programmer's computer files. But she starts to have doubts about what he's really after when she finds a huge stash of loot with the disks. He claims no knowledge of the money, she distrusts him, he's using her, things start getting dangerous and even murderous - and then her boyfriend shows up. When the scam turns deadly, murder and double-cross become the only way to finish their dangerous game.
