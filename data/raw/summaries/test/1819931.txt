Bill, a young new recruit in the Australian Special Air Service, arrives for his tour of duty in Vietnam. Other members of his section include Harry, the section's Corporal and the oldest and most worldly-wise of the group, along with 'Bung' Holey, Rogers, Dawson and Scotty. The close-knit group cope with their circumstances with a mixture of humour, cheek, practical jokes and copious quantities of beer. Harry has an ongoing verbal feud with the company cook over the questionable quality of the food. During the first weeks of their stay in Vietnam, their biggest enemies are mud, boredom, tinea and the never-ending torrential rains. But the real war strikes suddenly one night with an enemy mortar barrage which claims a number of casualties. The section's first operation takes place shortly afterwards, leading to a short but sharp engagement in the dense jungle which leaves Scotty mortally wounded and one enemy soldier wounded in return but the latter escapes. This sets the pattern for the remainder of their tour- long, exhausting and often un-eventful patrols interrupted by short but savage encounters with either the enemy himself or mines & boody-traps he has left behind. Back at camp, the men resort to anything to pass the time and keep fear and grief at bay, including drunken brawls, a practical joke on the padre and an insect-fighting contest with an American unit. Bill receives a thinly-disguised break-up letter from his girlfriend back home. Whilst on leave in Saigon, Holey catches a young pick-pocket who has just robbed a pair of US soldiers. They take the boy's stolen cash and team up with the Americans for a wild night with hookers. Even Bill partakes of the latter's services. During a quiet spell at camp, Harry confides in his mates that prior to joining the army, he used to be a professional artist and had suffered a painful marriage break-up. He also grows increasingly cynical about both the conduct and purposes of the war and is bitter about the lack of gratitude and interest they will receive upon returning home. Holey is devastated by news from Australia that his mother and girlfriend have both perished in a car accident. Whilst on patrol, Rogers steps on a mine, losing both his feet. His mates visit him in hospital before he is sent home and he asks Harry to check if his testicles are still present . A major offensive is launched and the section is sent into action, assigned to capture an enemy-held bridge. They take the bridge, wiping out an enemy machine-gun nest but Holey is killed. The section is then ordered to withdraw, prompting Harry to comment that the whole morning's work has been for nothing. Shortly afterwards, Harry, Bill and Dawson are informed that they are being sent home. Back in Australia, Harry and Bill have a beer at a harbourside pub. The barman asks them if they have just returned from Vietnam but Harry replies 'No'. The two friends quietly reflect on their experiences as the film ends.
