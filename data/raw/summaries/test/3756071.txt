A garbage can spaceship is flying near Earth, where the same garbage can is later shown inside an antique shop owned by Captain Manzini . Meanwhile, A boy named Dodger is being assaulted by four bullies in a park. The leader of the bullies, Juice, steals Dodger's money and drops him in a puddle. Dodger goes to Captain Manzini's antique shop where he works, where Captain Manzini takes Dodger's clothes and cleans them while warning him to stay away from the garbage can. Later, Dodger sees Tangerine, one of the bullies and Juice's girlfriend, who seems to be the most compassionate one towards Dodger, and tries to persuade her to buy something. Dodger is attracted to Tangerine and covertly smells her hair while she is distracted. The other bullies enter the shop and attempt to rough up Dodger again, but he manages to outwit them. However, amidst the tussle, the garbage can is knocked over. The bullies then bring Dodger into a sewer, handcuff him to a rail, and open a sewage pipe on him. Dodger is saved by little mysterious people named the Garbage Pail Kids. Captain Manzini returns and is upset that the Garbage Pail Kids have been released from their can, but introduces Dodger to each of them. Greaser Greg is a leather jacket-clad greaser with an attitude, Messy Tessie is a girl with a constantly running nose, Windy Winston is a boy who wears a Hawaiian shirt and often farts violently, Valerie Vomit is a girl who throws up on command, Foul Phil is a whining baby with halitosis who constantly asks characters if they are his "mommy" or "daddy", Nat Nerd is an acne-riddled boy who dresses up like a superhero and wets his pants frequently and Ali Gator, the group's natural leader, is an anthropomorphic alligator who has an appetite for human toes. Captain Manzini explains that the kids are forbidden from going in public, because they'll be attacked by the "normies" , and that he can't get the kids to go back into the garbage can without magic. The next day, Dodger goes with Tangerine to a night club where she sells clothes she designed herself. Dodger behaves awkwardly when Tangerine removes her shirt to sell it. A moment later, Dodger has to hide when Juice shows up. Meanwhile, the Garbage Pail Kids steal a Pepsi truck, flatten Juice's car with it, and then have a camp fire in an alley with stolen food. The next morning, the Garbage Pail Kids recover from hangovers and give Dodger a jacket they sewed. The jacket impresses Tangerine who asks Dodger to get more clothes so she can sell them. The Garbage Pail Kids get bored and decide to wear disguises to go out in public. Some of them go to a theater playing Three Stooges shorts and behave obnoxiously. Ali Gator and Windy Winston go to a bar where they start a fight with bikers, who are soon won over by the Kids' heroics, in which they celebrate with beers. The Kids make more clothes for Dodger after stealing a sewing machine and singing a song about working together. Tangerine sells the clothes and begins to prepare for a fashion show based on them. She meets the Kids and is repulsed by them, but realizes she can take advantage of their designs. The night of the fashion show, Tangerine locks the Kids in the basement of the antique shop so that they don't escape, and soon, they are captured by Juice and his gang who bring them to the State Home for the Ugly, a prison where people too ugly for society are brought and executed. People there include the "too fat" Santa Claus, the "too bald" Gandhi, and the "too tall" Abraham Lincoln. Captain Manzini and Dodger help them escape and head to the fashion show. The Garbage Pail Kids trash the fashion show and rip the clothes off the models, while Dodger gets in a fight with Juice. Later that night, Tangerine apologizes to Dodger and asks to be his friend, but Dodger doesn't accept her apology for her greed. Captain tries to sing the Garbage Pail Kids' song backwards to coax them back into the garbage can, but the Kids sneak out and ride ATVs away. The story ends with a cliff hanger ending  which were originally meant to be solved in a proposed "Garbage Pail Kids" live-action TV series , which never materialized beyond the proposal stage.
