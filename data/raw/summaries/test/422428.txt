He sees it as an opportunity to reconnect with his estranged wife  and growing children, as well as a chance to show up his wealthier know-it-all brother, Mack . Nate takes delivery on an expensive new SUV, persuades his recently separated wife Dorothy to tag along, and packs up his three kids &mdash; nubile teenager Nikki , under-age wannabe rapper D.J. ([[Bow Wow , and precocious seven-year-old Destiny  &mdash; for what he imagines will be a leisurely drive from Los Angeles to Missouri. However, between his wary wife, arguing kids, angry police officers, a bizarre hitchhiker , bad diner food, and an unfortunate run-in with a cement mixer, getting from point A to point B proves to be just short of a nightmare.
