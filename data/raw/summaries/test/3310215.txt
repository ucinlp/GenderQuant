A public garden colony will be demolished to make way for a superhighway. But when the excavators find a bomb , on the land of old man Kupke, he threatens to detonate it: "the garden colony must stay!" The tenant of the neighbouring plot, an anarchic punk named Kanzler, joins in the fight: he demands a memorial for Germany's famous student leader Rudi Dutschke. The two very different men grow closer.
