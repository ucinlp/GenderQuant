Ramata is a spellbindingly beautiful woman in her fifties. She has been married for thirty years now to Matar Samb, a former prosecutor who is now the Minister of Justice. They live in Les Almadies, an elegant neighbourhood of Dakar. Ngor Ndong is 25. He is a young, strong, mysterious man with no fixed residence and an occasional petty crook known by the police. One evening, in a taxi that Ngor Ndong just happens to be driving, Ramata agrees to follow this young man to the Copacabana. She then begins a new life.{{cite web}}
