A team of environmentalists, including a reporter, her camera man, and an environmentalist's famous girlfriend charter a boat and with the captain, sail to a military island. They suspect the island is hosting to illegal activities. Upon arrival, however, they find no one. They finally reach a deserted house, where they find Dr. Susan Richardson, who tells them that everyone on the island is dead, including her father. Richardson's team were working on a compound that could make edible plants grow to super size, however the military intervened with plans of their own. They wanted to test the compound's effects on animals, and proceeded to feed it to several komodo dragons and cobras. As a result, both species grows to an enormous size and begins to devour everything on the island, including the humans. The group, the doctor, and the boat captain must escape the island, while avoiding the huge creatures. The military finds out that some problems are happenning on the island, so they send in troops. Who are then attacked by a giant komodo dragon. Meanwhile, the group try to escape to the lab, barely escaping a cobra and komodo. One environmentalist is killed, and the camera man. In the lab, Richardson tells her flashback of how the military messed things up. Now just wanting to escape the island alive, the group try to get back to the beach. On the beach they try to get to the yacht, but the military drop a bomb on it. Then a cobra comes out the water and eats two more men. The remainder of the group decide to head for a helicopter that was left behind on a mountain by the doctor's father and team. While trying to cross a river to the mountain, one environmentalist is bit by huge leeches. That's when Dr. Richardson announces that anything that comes into contact with the animal DNA  can turn into a giant of its kind [ex. the leeches.] On the mountaintop, the remaining five run into a komodo blocking the helicopter, the komodo smelling their scent. Soon, the cobra joins the party. The man who was attacked by the leeches weakingly makes himself bait. With bullets not penitrating the cobra's skin, he is devoured. The military see footage of the giant komodo dragons and the yachtand decide to bomb the island, with the Americans still on it. Soon, the komodo and the cobra begin to fight each other. The boat driver, who used to be a helicopter driver, flies the three remaining women away. Both the komodo and the cobra are killed in a military bombing on the island, still in mid-battle. At the end of the film, a scientist who has escaped the komodo, reawakens from the dead with reptilian characteristics, such as glowing green eyes and a forked tongue, revealing he is turning into a komodo dragon [he had touched the komodo's saliva.]
