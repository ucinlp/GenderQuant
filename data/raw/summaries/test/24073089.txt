Folks! tells the story of Jon Aldrich , a successful stockbroker who is living the good life with a wife and kids until his aging father with dementia accidentally burns down his own house. Jon tries to get his sister, Arlene Aldrich  who has two sons of her own but is an irresponsible gold digger, but she won't even open the door. As a result his father Harry Aldrich/Pop  and his mother Mildred Alrdich  have to move in with him and his family. That is the moment that his good life starts going down hill. The company he works for was apparently doing illegal things which Jon knew nothing of, but no one believes him therefore he loses his job. The problems for Jon continue to mount up as the family becomes broke, his wife Audrey  thinks moves out with the kids, and they lose all their furniture and belongs except their apartment. Harry continues to unintentionally injure Jon, causing him hearing lost, a broken hand, a car runs over his foot, and he manages to lose a testicle. Jon slowly starts to lose his own sanity, but in a brief moment of his own sanity Harry tells Jon that he never wanted to be a burden on him but he soon slips back into his state of dementia, where he is just happy all the time and often yells out "McDonalds". Jon talks with his mother who also says that she and his father never wanted to be a burden on him. She then tells him that she and his father have discussed it, and they want Jon to help them die so he can collect the insurance money. Jon is totally against this at first but after a while he changes his tune. Jon helps his parents try to commit suicide many unsuccessful times and half way through the attempts Jon's sister Arlene shows up on his doorsteps with both of her corpulent sons in need of a place to live. Jon refuses at first due to the fact that she would not even open the door for them but he eventually caves in and lets them stay. Arlene also joins in on the attempts to help their parents die, hoping for a cut of the insurance money. Though her attempts are also unsuccessful. Things slowly start looking up for Jon as Audrey eventually shows up home to tell John she was wrong for leaving and how much she loves the fact that he was willing to take in both of his parents. Upon her arrival she realizes all all the injuries Jon has suffered since she saw him last, including the missing testicle. As they are reconciling Jon realizes that Arlene and his parents are gone and he knows they are going to try to commit suicide again with the help of his sister, so he tracks them down in an attempt to stop them which he successfully does, but not without facing a bit more injury. Alrdich eventually get their lives on track. Jon and Audrey buy a house and Jon's parents live with them. Arlene is now with a man who knows how to handle her bad behaving children. At the end we finally find out that Harry hasn't been yelling McDonalds because he was hungry, he was yelling it because he bought stock in McDonnell Douglas years and years ago, meaning he is worth tons of money.
