A frustrated building contractor battles with the Pink Panther over the design of a house being built. The original design has blue overtones and a more traditional shape; conversely, the panther's is rounded, sleek, and all pink. Several unsuccessful attempts are made at swapping the original house blueprint with the pink version. In conclusion, Pink gets the house he wants, but it is really the house the contractor was going to build in disguise.Beck, Jerry.
