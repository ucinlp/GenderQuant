Despite knowing of her jealous fianc√© Andre's strong contempt for beauty contests, typist Lucienne "Lulu" Garnier   mails two photographs of herself to enter the Miss France contest sponsored by the Globe newspaper. Upon further consideration, she tries to withdraw, but it is too late: she has already been chosen as a finalist. When she wins, she has to travel to Spain immediately to compete for the crown of Miss Europe without having an opportunity to break the news to Andre. When he finds out, he rushes to the train station too late. Lucienne is selected by audience applause to be Miss Europe. She attracts numerous ardent admirers, among them a maharajah and Prince Adolphe de Grabovsky. Andre shows up and gives her an ultimatum: return to France with him within the hour or they are through. She is torn, but chooses him. However, she is miserable in their apartment. When Grabovsky tracks her down to offer her a film contract with Sound Films International, she tears up the contract, but later that night, reconsiders and sneaks away to accept, leaving only a letter of explanation for Andre. She makes a short film, which the studio executives decide to premiere. By chance, newspaper worker Andre is given the item to typeset. He goes to see Lucienne, but is told that she is viewing the film and cannot be disturbed. He sneaks in anyway and shoots her in the back, killing her instantly. Andre drops the gun and makes no resistance when apprehended. Ironically, the film shows Lucienne singing a song about a woman imploring her lover not to be jealous of other men's attentions.
