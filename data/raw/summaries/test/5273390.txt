Judy Sanders , who works in a research facility, has contacted TV personality Lori Tanner . The plan was for them to meet after work. Judy is going to let Lori into the research facility to show her the atrocities that go on behind closed doors at EMAX. Dr. Jarret , who is doing vivisection and genetic altering, discovers the plan and Judy is killed by one of his experiments. Laurie keeps her appointment, but when Judy does not show, she decides to break into the lab where she finds and films dead bodies and animals that are in the middle of research projects. Among them is a Tibetan Mastiff named Max , who has been genetically altered with big cats and other exotic animals. While shooting the lab scene, Max escapes. Dr. Jarret, discovering the filming, chases Lori out of the research facility. Max follows and as Lori drives away, Max jumps into her car. Jarret goes to the police complaining that his dog has been stolen. Later that day when Lori goes shopping, a thief  steals her purse. Max chases him and brings Lori's purse back to her. The thief is later found dead, and Jarret verifies that it had to be Max who killed him. Lori wants to keep Max, but her boyfriend Perry  is absolutely against the idea. He finally agrees as long as Max remains in the backyard. However, Max  understands conversations between people. He also has unusual abilities . Max is also in love with Lori, and a rivalry results between Max and Perry. Max finesses his way into the house, goes upstairs and peeks through the key hole of Lori's bedroom, where he sees Lori making love to her boyfriend. He pounds on the door until Lori opens it whereupon Max attempts to attack Perry. He tells Lori to put the dog outside. Max, while being a big lovable dog to Lori, has a propensity to be a killer due to his genetic altering. For instance, when the paperboy  hits Max in the head with a newspaper, Max chases him and tears up his bicycle tire. When the neighbor's cat Boo irritates Max, Lori's young neighbor Rudy  and his friend Chet  let Max chase the cat down the street and right up a tree which Max has the ability to do because of his genetic altering with big cats. In a very gory scene, he catches the cat and devours him alive. Rudy and Chet then flee, thinking that Max might hurt them. Meanwhile, Max is madly in love with Rudy's pet Collie Heidi. One day after escaping his confinement, he spies on Rudy taking Heidi into his house. After Rudy and his father  leave for the baseball game, Max jumps the fence, climbs through the window, and mates with Heidi. In another scene, Max is maced by the mailman. The mace does not affect Max who chases the mailman, jumps over a fence, attacks and kills him by grabbing his leg with his mouth with him on the other end. He later tries to bury the body. In the meantime, the jealousy between Max and Perry has accelerated. Max destroys the brake lining in Perry's truck, and Perry attempts to kill Max with poisoned hamburger. Max, being of super intelligence, realizes the meat is poisoned and instead of eating the meat, Max chases Perry out of the house. But Perry manages to escape in his truck. Being frustrated by this, Max kills Ed the Parrot by knocking over his cage and eating him up. Then, Max puts the hamburger meat in the toilet and flushes it down the drain. Lori, not knowing that any of this has happened but feeling the animosity of Perry towards Max, feels that she must find Max a home. She takes him to a junkyard where she leaves him with Ray  the junkyard dealer who assures Lori that Max will be taken to a ranch for a couple of days. Instead, when Lori leaves in her car and Max keeps barking for her, Ray chains Max and hits him over the head with a shovel, knocking Max out. When Max regains consciousness, he pulls loose from his chain and attacks Ray who in turn puts a blowtorch to Max's face and then Max kills him by biting his crotch so hard that it bleeds. Soon, Ray is taken to the hospital. Max, now terribly burned, escapes and makes his way home to get even with Perry. He climbs the wall of the house, opens the window, and chases Perry, who runs into the closet. Max then crashes through the closet door, attacking Perry, pulls him out into the bedroom, and urinates acid on him. Perry is quickly rushed to the hospital. Max, going berserk, runs down the stairs and Rudy attempts to stop Max with his baseball bat. But before he can hit Max, he grabs the bat with his mouth and hurls Rudy through the air and into the corner of the stairs. The police, by this time, have heard enough about Max to believe that he is a dangerous dog. They arrive at the house, and the pursuit of Max begins. However, Max manages to escape by jumping over the police cars and making them crash into each other. In an attempt to get Max back, Dr. Jarret kidnaps Lori, hoping Max will follow, which he does. However, in doing so, Max jumps on the car, causing the car to crash into the front of the EMAX building. Lori manages to pull herself free from the wrecked car and run into the building. For the first time, Max turns on Lori and chases her into the lab. His eyes are wild and glassy, and there are scars on his face from the blowtorch. Lori grabs a knife to protect herself, but in the end, their love for each other is stronger than his propensity for violence and her fear of him. In a very sentimental scene, Lori reaches out with her bloody hand to touch Max, who returns to loving her. Suddenly, Dr. Jarret comes back into the lab and attempts to shoot Lori. Max leaps to protect Lori, but takes the bullet himself and is killed. However, pushed by Max, Jarret falls on top of a large cage, and Lori's new curious puppy, Spike, ignites a live wire resting on the cage, electrocuting Jarret and killing him instantly. Soon after, Max's body is found by Lori, who mourns for his death. Three months later, Lori is going for a walk with Spike , and as she passes Rudy's home, Rudy invites her in to see the new litter of puppies Heidi just had . All of them look like Heidi, except one little black dog which looks exactly like Max.
