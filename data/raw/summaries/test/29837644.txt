The film starts with the Thunder Driller  digging up some dirt. In it is a man called Clutch Powers  and he jumps off looking for a power crystal. He sees a variety of them, but finally sees a large one. He grabs it and suddenly the Queen Rock Monster wakes up and chases Clutch to his Underground Headquarters. Clutch gets the power crystal by shooting himself over the Queen and ends up stuck in a cave. However, the crystal opens up to reveal itself as a Rock Monster baby. Realizing his mistake, Clutch returns the baby to the Queen, apologizing for his action and stating that he only wants a power crystal. Understanding the point, the Queen Rock Monster gives Clutch a real power crystal, allowing him to leave. Clutch returns to Lego City and hands the crystal to his boss Kjeld Playwell  who assigns him some new teammates: Brick Masterson  firefighter weapons specialist and demolition expert, Peg Mooring  a biologist, and Bernie von Beam  an engineer. Using the crystal to power up the supercomputers, Playwell informs of an incident in the Space Police prison planet when chaos occurs regarding to the imprisonment of the three most wanted criminals in the Lego galaxy. He then orders Clutch and his team to investigate the situation at once, despite the team's lack of cooperation and Clutch's intent of working alone. They meet up with Arthur 'Artie' Fol  who is a Clutch Powers fan. He creates a police space ship that will transport them to the prison planet, so they leave in the afternoon. Peg meets up with Clutch and finds out that he had a dark past with his lost father Rock Powers; it is also revealed the symbol in the Space Prison video footage during the attack is the same one in Rock's journal regarding to his last whereabouts. Before Clutch can speak further, Brick interrupts to tell them that they have arrived at the planet. They get into their astronaut suits and they enter the prison building. They see that someone is stuck in one of the prisoners' cells, but they are attacked by an unseen wizard, who happens to be one of the criminals leading the other two. The criminals then disappear and Clutch and his friends break the person out of the cell, revealing himself to be Watch Commander. Clutch and his team attempt to go after the criminals, though the Watch Commander comforts them by stating that he has pulled off the spark plugs of all ships to ensure that the criminals will never escape from the planet. Unfortunately, the criminals have taken the team's ship  and destroy the other ships, inciting the Watch Commander to berate the team for their arguing and their lack of cooperation. Feeling guilty, Clutch decides to take action and builds a new ship for the team to move on, declaring that a team arguing with each other while being ordered to do their tasks is the sole reason why he always works alone. During the trip back, the team is informed by Playwell that the symbol refers to Omega, one of the two criminals led by the evil wizard, and that the criminals have gone their separate ways following the escape. Playwell also informs that the evil wizard who planned the escape is none other than Mallock the Malign, infamous for terrorizing a medieval planet named Ashlar. The planet's ruler, who was the late King, was informed to having sacrificed his own life to ensure his kingdom's safety and Mallock's previous imprisonment, and has left his son Prince Varen with his powerful golden sword to rule, despite Prince Varen's incapability of preparing in battle. Playwell then orders Clutch and the team to head over there to capture Mallock. The team manages to get to Ashlar, but their ship accidentally knocks down Lego-Henge . They get off and take refuge in a Medieval camp with extra parts, but not after witnessing a group of armed skeletons marching down the forests, realizing that Mallock has gained a stranglehold of Ashlar around his fortress with a skeleton army acting as his own forces. As Peg, Brick, and Bernie create a battle chariot, Clutch leaves to get Prince Varen to convince him to fight against Mallock. Meanwhile in Mallock's fortress, Mallock learns of the team's presence and orders his two skeleton henchmen Skelly and Bones to go after Clutch so they can find the prince and the golden sword to finalize his takeover of Ashlar. Back in the forest, Clutch ends up in a bridge but a troll named Hogar refuses to let him across until Clutch solves three riddles. Though Clutch gets them all right, Skelly and Bones catch up with him after a failed attempt to trap him, demanding Hogar to surrender Clutch to them at once. Hogar attempts to ward off the skeletons by hypnotizing them, but they don't fall for it, prompting an annoyed Hogar to eat Clutch and runs away to a secret doorway that is painted like an ending forest to escape the skeletons. Having escaped Skelly and Bones, Hogar throws Clutch out of his stomach on the other side and shows him the way to the kingdom of Prince Varen, telling him about the history of his father and the golden sword. Hogar also tells Clutch that he was the only troll that was on the kingdom's team and that he was assigned to protect Varen. Back at the Medieval Camp, Bernie develops a crush on Peg, who leaves to look for a relaxing land, but later befriends a dragon. Back in the kingdom, Clutch finds Prince Varen and he helps him wield a sword but he fails and gets angry at Clutch. Clutch protests that he was trying to help him defeat the Wizard team, but Varen rejects him, confessing that he's scared of Mallock. Enraged, Clutch goes back to the camp and sees that a dwarf will help them so they set out to stop Mallock on their own. Eventually, Prince Varen, Hogar, and their knights find out that Clutch was telling the truth and decide to give a shot in their battle against Mallock. Varen and Clutch stow away in the back of Mallock's castle by making Peg a fake Varen. Unfortunately, Mallock plays wise to their moves and traps them in a bone cage outside a lava river and the growing Skeleton Army drove the knights away to retreat. Back in the castle, Mallock makes a screen in front of the clouds to show them that Clutch and Varen will be killed unless the golden sword is surrendered to him immediately. Having no choice, Hogar brings the golden sword's case to Mallock so he can free them, only to find that's it empty at the last minute. Enraged, Mallock traps Hogar in lightning and throws him back to the doorway of Varen's castle, leaving him trapped. Varen and Clutch make a message to the team so they can rely on themselves. Bernie gets fueled up by hope and they rebuild their broken chariot. They reunite with the knights and they attack the Skeleton Army. Back in the castle, Peg finally get the dragon to cut down the cage, freeing Clutch and Varen, who then get to the gates, where they find the golden sword that was left earlier, since Mallock didn't bother to search for it. After very much convincing from Clutch, Varen finally decides to face his fear of Mallock to ensure his kingdom's safety. Around the same time, Mallock attempts to lure Clutch into giving the sword to him by promising to lead him to his father, but Clutch refuses. As Clutch watches Varen using the golden sword to fight against Mallock, Brick uses a jetpack and lands in the eye of Mallock's fortress and fights with Skelly and Bones. Despite Brick being outnumbered by Skelly and Bones, Bernie helps him by throwing a disc at the skeletons and they get killed. Back inside the fortress, Mallock taunts Varen of retaining his title as Prince of Ashlar as he uses his staff to attack Varen. However, Varen finally engulfs enough power from Mallock's staff into his sword, allowing the sword to unleash its full power, much to Mallock's shock. Taking the opportunity, Varen uses the sword to trap Mallock with a glowing chain, declaring Mallock under arrest and himself the new King of Ashlar. Following Mallock's defeat, Hogar is freed from his restrains and the Skeleton army disappears into puffs of smoke, leaving Clutch's team and the knights to celebrate their victory. With peace declared open in Ashlar, Varen is then officially declared the new King, and when Clutch and his team pack up to transport the chained Mallock back to Lego City, Varen thanks him for being loyal and for being part of the team. The team then return to Lego City, allowing the authorities to send the imprisoned Mallock in a cage back to the prison planet. Congratulating the team for their efforts, Playwell tells them that Omega and the other unnamed criminal are still on the loose, and they have gotten reports of the unnamed criminal's location in another planet. Encouraged with a newfound belief of teamwork, the team head onward to a new adventure to capture the criminal.
