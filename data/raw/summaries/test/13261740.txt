In New York City, a man in a suit and tie has undisclosed problems: his corporate I.D. has expired and he's denied entrance to an office building. A young woman cadges money from strangers with an emotional story of losing her ride home and needing funds. One morning at a diner, he offers her a job. She accepts with an eye to anything of value in his flat. Then, his conversation turns to raving.
