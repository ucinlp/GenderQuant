{{Plot}} It is New York City, 1905. Miss Lily Bart is young, witty and beautiful. Along with her quiet cousin, Grace Stepney, she lives with her wealthy aunt, Julia Peniston. Lily, a socialite raised in comfort and always admired, soon learns that there are bitter consequences for a single woman without wealth trapped in an uncaring society. Lily's closest friend is Mr. Lawrence Selden, a lawyer. Relaxing at his flat, she teasingly points out how seldom he comes to see her. He gently reminds her that he is not a good catch, i.e. not rich enough for her to marry. When she leaves his apartment, she runs into wealthy Simon Rosedale, who is instantly smitten with her. On the train to Bellomont, she invites Mr. Percy Gryce to sit next to her. Another acquaintance, Mrs. Bertha Dorset, takes the seat next to Lily. Lily is encouraged by her good friend Judy Trenor to pursue wealthy but dull Percy Gryce. Lily and Mr. Gryce arrange a date for the next morning to go to church, but Lily misses it on purpose; she waits in the park for Mr. Selden. They take a walk, and while chatting dreamily about love and marriage they forget all caution and kiss. Mr. Gryce has been watching and leaves abruptly because of Lily’s behavior. A dejected Lily pours out her troubles to Judy's husband, Gus Trenor, and he agrees to help her make money through an investment. Later, Lily innocently comes across some scandalous letters Bertha Dorset wrote that reveal Selden was her lover. Lily is hurt and disillusioned but keeps the letters a secret. At a wedding, Lily receives a $5,000 check from Gus Trenor, who claims to have also reinvested another $4,000. He wants to see her alone, but she suggests he see her at her aunt’s house. He invites Lily to the opera, where she also meets Lawrence Selden and Simon Rosedale. Late that night, Selden tells Lily that he loves her. They kiss, but Gus Trenor is watching them. Later, Lily goes to the opera with Gus Trenor and Sim Rosedale. Lily later leaves with Gus, but he lures her into his home and tries to kiss her. Lily flees but she still owes Gus money, over 9,000 dollars. At home, Aunt Julia tells Lily she won’t give her any more money and how much she disapproves of Lily’s behavior. Lily is devastated. Lily longs for Lawrence Selden to come to her. Instead loud, coarse Simon Rosedale comes to call. He has been eyeing her for quite some time. His wealth could free Lily from danger, yet his marriage proposal makes her shudder with disgust. Later that day, Bertha Dorset invites Lily to the Dorsets' yacht for a cruise in the Mediterranean. Lily is desperate to escape New York, the whispers and the constant criticism. Bertha slyly describes the tranquil cruise in glowing terms, with a French chef, a masseuse, and every conceivable form of luxury. Tempted by images of tranquility and bliss, Lily gives in and agrees to go. In Monte Carlo, Mrs. Carry Fisher meets Lawrence Selden, who just arrived from London. They are both very worried about Lily. Meanwhile Lily herself is having a massage on the yacht, her eyes growing heavy, while George Dorset is snoring nearby. A young man is reading French poetry to Bertha. The two of them soon slip away together. Hours later, Lily and George awake and look for them in vain. Next morning, an angry George enters Lily’s cabin, blaming her for everything. When Bertha finally arrives, Lily confronts her, but Bertha viciously accuses Lily of adultery with George. Lawrence Selden arrives on the scene and is shocked. Lily is barred from returning to the yacht. Back in New York, Aunt Julia has died. Lily is cut out of her will in favor of mousy little Cousin Grace. A dazed Lily is now homeless and adrift. Carry Fisher invites her to stay with her and the Gormers for the summer at her house. Carry believes Lily must get married, and there are two only two possibilities left, George Dorset and Sim Rosedale. Vengeful George asks Lily to tell the truth about his wife Bertha, since Lily witnessed what happened on the cruise, but she denies any knowledge. Simon Rosedale knows about Bertha’s letters and advises Lily to use them against Bertha. He offers to marry Lily once Bertha has been disgraced, but Lily refuses. Lily goes to work for Mrs. Hatch as her social secretary. Selden gently tells Lily this isn’t appropriate, but she defends herself saying she needs the money. Lily frequently goes to the pharmacy to get Mrs. Hatch’s sleeping medication, and after a while begins taking it herself. After Mrs. Hatch fires Lily, Lily takes up millinery piece work, but gets fired because she works too slowly and poorly. Lily goes to see Grace Stepney and asks for a loan, but is coldly rejected. When Sim Rosedale invites Lily to tea, she tells him everything, but refuses his help because it would again put her in debt to a man. The next morning, Lily decides to confront Bertha Dorset with those letters she once wrote to Mr. Selden, but finds that the Dorsets have left town. Lily goes to Lawrence Selden and breaks down desperately, telling him she knows she lost his love. When Lawrence isn’t looking, she throws the letters in the fire. Lily goes home and receives an envelope containing her inheritance at last. She writes two checks, one for the bank, the other one for Gus Trenor, and takes the sleeping medicine once again. She lies down in bed, loses consciousness and dies. Selden discovers the burnt letters in his fireplace, but when he hurries to Lily’s apartment, he finds her and cries at her deathbed, telling her he loves her.
