Shep  and Kate  run a farm. Their daughters, Martha , Jane  and Beth  also live on the farm as well as a farmhand named Fred . The film starts as Fred ridicules the three daughters for peeping on their parents having sex. In return, the three daughters join up to carry him off. Their parents notice the commotion, but think their daughters just want to toy with him. Alas, the daughters push him into a bed and proceed to mount and gang rape him, which includes subjecting him to facesitting. After they are done, Martha spits his own ejaculation on his face. They then warn him not to tell their parents what they did. To stress the point, Beth whips his bottom with a flyswatter while Jane scratches him painfully. After they all pee on him, they start gang raping him once again - at this point three escaped convicts walk by and see them. The convicts  continue on to the parents' house and stop them in mid-intercourse. One of the convicts rapes Kate while another makes Shep watch and the third goes back to get the daughters. The first two convicts then knock out Shep and gang rape Kate together. The daughters walk by the house and see their parents tied up naked and gagged. After they remove his gag, Shep tells them to run away, but outside they stumble into the convict who was sent to bring them earlier. The three convicts then rape the three daughters in front of their nude parents in a twisted game of Simon says, until a returning Fred steals the convicts' sole shotgun. Fred holds the convicts at gunpoint, but does the same to the family, telling them they have to pay for what the daughters did to him earlier. The convicts don't take him seriously and so he fatally shoots one of them. Turning back to the family, Fred orders the daughters' mother Kate to give him fellatio. Interested to punish the family by making them engage in incest, Fred orders Martha to give a likewise fellatio to her own father Shep. After this, Fred makes the three daughters have sex with their mother Kate and orders the remaining convicts to urinate on the women. As Fred does the same, Shep is able to get hold of the shotgun and kill Fred. The entire plot is then fast forwarded in reverse chronology, until it is revealed this was all a daydream that Fred was having while he was being urinated on by the farmer's daughters after they finished gang-raping him. The film ends as they splash water on him to "clean him up".
