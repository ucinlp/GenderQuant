In this film, Amitabh Bachchan plays the role of an obsessed lover, which could be regarded as a model on which several other such roles were based, notably the one enacted by Shah Rukh Khan much later in Darr, Anjaam and to an extent in Baazigar. Several other actors in various movies have portrayed similar roles. Amitabh plays Kumar Sen, an artist by profession. He is in love with Asha . Asha wins a trip to Ooty in a dance competition, and falls in love with a wealthy tea plantation owner, Rajesh . When Kumar finds out, he goes to Asha's uncle, Ashok Verma , and demands Asha's hand in marriage. When Ashok Verma fails to comply, Kumar kills him. The manner in which Kumar plans and executes the murder is regarded as an immensely brilliant and engaging sequence. Kumar boards and exits, various modes of transport to avoid any possibilities of suspicion and finally frames Rajesh in the case and tries to win Asha's love. Asha, still in love with Rajesh, promises Kumar to stay with him forever, if he can get Rajesh released from his death sentence. Unable to digest that, Kumar understands that Rajesh will always remain Asha's love. He writes down his confession, gives it to Rajesh, and shoots himself.
