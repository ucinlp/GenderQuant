The film opens as Julia Jenz  arrives at Dr. Schifrin's house for a routine baby-sitting gig. Soon after Dr. Schifrin leaves, a mysterious man knocks on the door, asking Julia to let him inside to use the phone on the strength that his car is broken down. Julia refuses to let the man inside but agrees to call his auto club. The phone is dead. Unwilling to divulge to the man that the phone is dead, Julia lies by saying that she in fact called the auto club. Of course, the auto club never arrives, so after some time, the man knocks again. Hoping he goes away, Julia continues to lie, but each encounter at the door becomes increasingly sinister. Meanwhile, several things inside the house turn up missing or are suddenly out of place, events in which Julia is just very slightly aware of at first. Soon, however, it becomes obvious that someone is moving in and out of the house, at which time Julia discovers that the children have been abducted. The intruder eventually comes after Julia; however, she is able to escape just as she comes within the intruder's reach. Five years later, Julia, is an introverted college student, still traumatized by the incident. To make matters worse, strange things are happening from time to time in her apartment, and Julia believes that the intruder is once again stalking her. Jill Johnson , now a counselor, and John Clifford  come to Julia's aid. Having been through a similar situation years prior, Jill and a reluctant John investigate and eventually track down the stalker in a surprise ending that revolves around who he is and how he can seemingly 'disappear' from sight. He then gets killed.
