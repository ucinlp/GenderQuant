Decorated Vietnam vet Frank Vega  returns home only to be shunned by society, leaving him without a job or his high school sweetheart. It's not until forty years later when an incident on a commuter bus, where he protects an elderly black man from a pair of skinheads, makes him a local hero, and he's suddenly celebrated once again. But his good fortune suddenly turns for the worse when his best friend Klondike  is murdered and the police aren't doing anything about it.
