The film begins after the 1997 British general election, where Tony Blair  becomes Britain's Labour prime minister. The Queen  is slightly wary of Blair and his pledge to "modernise" the country, but Blair promises to respect the Royal Family. Three months later, Diana, Princess of Wales dies in a car crash in the Alma Bridge tunnel in Paris along with her companion Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul. Blair's director of communications, Alastair Campbell , prepares a speech in which Diana is described as "the people's princess". Blair gives his speech the next day and the phrase catches on. Over the next few days, millions of people across London display an outpouring of grief at Buckingham and Kensington Palaces. Meanwhile, the Royal Family are still at Balmoral Castle, their summer estate in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Diana's death sparks division among numerous members of the family. The Royal Family observes that, since Diana was divorced from her husband, Prince Charles  a year earlier, she is no longer a part of the family. They insist that Diana's funeral is a "private affair" and is best left to Diana's noble family, the Spencers. Charles argues that the mother of a future king cannot be dismissed so lightly, and the Queen allows the use of an aircraft of the British Royal Flight to bring Diana's body back to England. In London, flowers pile up along the palace railings, forcing the changing of the Queen's guard to use another gate. British tabloids become inflammatory about the lack of a statement from the Royal Family. Charles leaves no doubt that he shares Blair's views about the need for a statement. As the Royal Family's ratings plummet, Blair's popularity rises, to the delight of his anti-monarchist advisers and wife Cherie . However, Blair does not share these sentiments. While disagreeing with the Queen's course of action, Blair begins to develop an admiration for her. Blair disagrees with his wife's views and tells her that a republican Britain is ludicrous, and begins to denounce the anti-royal disdain of his Labour Party advisors. Blair calls the Queen at Balmoral and recommends strong measures to regain public confidence for the monarchy: attend a public funeral for Diana at Westminster Abbey, fly a Union flag at half mast over Buckingham Palace, and speak to the nation about Diana's life and legacy in a televised address. Blair's recommendations outrage several other members of the Royal Family including Prince Philip  and the Queen Mother . Philip is surprised that Elton John is asked to attend and sing a song, "Candle in the Wind" in Diana's memory. They view such steps as an undignified surrender to public hysteria. The Queen seems concerned about this and although she shares their feelings, she has doubts as she closely follows the news. The Queen believes that there has been a shift in public values and that perhaps she should abdicate. The Queen Mother dismisses the idea, saying that she is one of the greatest assets her monarchy has ever had, stating: "The real problem will come when you leave". She also reminds the Queen of the promise she made in Cape Town, South Africa on her 21st birthday, in which she promised that her "whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong..." Meanwhile, Philip attempts to distract William and Harry  from Diana's death by taking them deer stalking. While venturing out alone in her Land Rover, the Queen damages the vehicle while crossing a river and is forced to telephone for assistance. The Queen weeps in frustration, but catches sight of a majestic Red Deer which Philip, William, and Harry have been stalking. She is struck by his beauty and the two stare at each other. Hearing a distant gunshot, she shoos the animal away. The Queen decides to carry out Blair's recommendations. While preparing to return to London to attend Diana's public funeral, the Queen is horrified to learn that the deer has been killed on a neighbouring estate. She asks to see the stag and is upset at its loss. The Royal Family finally return to London to inspect the floral tributes, and while watching live television coverage along with his staff, Blair becomes angry and disappointed at his Labour Party advisors, for which he states that the Queen is admirable, and thinks that Diana had thrown everything she offered back in her face and seemed to destroy everything held most dear by the Queen. The Queen later follows Blair's advice and gives her public statement, speaking about Diana's life and legacy on live television and describing Diana as "an exceptional and gifted human being". Two months after Diana's death, Blair visits Buckingham Palace for a weekly meeting. The Queen finally regained her popularity, but she believes that Blair has benefited himself from her acquiescence to his advice and that she will never fully recover from "that week". The Queen cautions Blair that one day, he will find that public opinion can rapidly turn against him and declares that times have changed and that the monarchy must "modernise". When Blair suggests that he can help with this, the Queen replies: "Don't get ahead of yourself, Prime Minister. Remember, I'm supposed to be the one advising you".
