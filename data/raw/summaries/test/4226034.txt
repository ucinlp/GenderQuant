John  an ambitious young copper, is sent undercover into the hardcore football gangs to track down the 'generals' - the shadowy figures who orchestrate the violence. Gradually, the hard drinking, hard fighting macho world - where Saturday's match and Saturday's rumble are all that matters - proves irresistible and John slowly finds himself turning into one of the thugs he has been sent to destroy. The film features the fictitious teams of Shadwell Town and Wapping FC. The locations the teams are based on are real â€“ they are neighbouring areas on the north bank of the River Thames, in London's East End.
