The Austrian empress, nicknamed Sissi, enjoys travelling through Hungary, where she ultimately finds the politically priceless affection of local Count Andrássy too intimate. But this is only temporary relief from the frustrations of court life in Vienna, where dutiful Franz remains chained to his desk and leaves his chillingly strict mother Sophie interfering, even in the upbringing of their daughter, Gisella. When Sissi is diagnosed with possibly fatal tuberculosis and Franz has to allow Sophie to remove their daughter on doctor's warning, Sissi is in danger of losing the will to live while exiled to recovery-inducing climates on Madeira and Corfu). Then desperately needed psychosomatic therapy appears in the form of her indestructibly positive mother Ludovika. She lovingly nurses both her sickness and her taste for life on idyllic walks. Once again Oberst Böckl, the clumsy body-guard whose doting admiration for the empress borders on the improper, provides a comical note, as he does in each part of the trilogy. Finally, Sissi is well enough to rejoin her husband on an official visit to Milan and Venice, part of Austria's remaining possessions in northern Italy. Nationalists have prepared a hostile welcome for the Habsburg sovereigns; the Italian nobility creates a provokation by sending their dressed-up servants to a royal command performance at La Scala and the crowds stand in hostile silence at the couple's procession by royal barge on the Grand Canal. But the emotional Italians melt for the ostentatiously loving reunion of Sissi and her little daughter on St Mark's Square
