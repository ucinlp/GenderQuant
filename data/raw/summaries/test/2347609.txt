Wainwright was then assigned to cover the Battle of Dunkirk and after the evacuation of Allied troops and the French surrender he could not return to Paris. He later learned that his wife was murdered by the Nazis for participating in the French Resistance and that his small son went missing during a bombing raid. The above information was learned by the audience in a flashback, which is narrated by Wainwright. The war is now over and the grieving widower has returned to Paris to find his lost little boy. His best friend is Pierre Verdier . Wainwright has been told that his son is living in an orphanage. He finds a sad and confused boy , who does bear a resemblance to Lisa, and Wainwright believes he might be his son. The Mother Superior  insists that the boy is his, but Wainwright is sceptical and sets out to test him. He begins to form an emotional attachment to the boy, but eventually, when the boy fails the test, Wainwright realises that the child has been fed information in order to help him pass the test. He confronts the nun, who confesses to having tried to help the boy because of her determination to see that the orphans are placed in good homes and have happy lives. Though Wainwright and the boy have formed a bond, he cannot get over his grief until he speaks to a friend who advises him to face up to his wife's death. While out and about, he has seen a stuffed toy ideantical to one that Wainwright had won at a carnival for Lisa, and which was named "Binky", and has bought it and sent it to the orphanage.
