Jackie Morrison works as a CCTV operator for Glasgow City Council. She watches over a small part of the world and takes her duties to protect people seriously. In the film, she is presented as a person who observes parts of Glasgow through the CCTV lenses, but rarely participates in this world. She lives somewhat of an isolated existence. One day a man appears in her monitors, a man she thought she would never see again. Now that the opportunity presents itself, she is compelled to confront him. She becomes obsessed with following this man, both in real life and on the CCTV. Jackie attends a party at the man's flat on Red Road with a view to finding out more about him. The tension builds as it is not revealed immediately in the film as to why she is so obsessed with the man. The audience receives very little information as to why Jackie chooses to pursue this person with such determination, focus and resilience. At the end of the film the shocking truth is revealed.
