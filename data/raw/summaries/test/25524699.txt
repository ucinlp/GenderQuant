Four dancers, nearing their eighties, take up the challenge of Heike Hennig to return to the stage in Leipzig’s opera house. Ursula Cain, Christa Franze, Siegfried Prölß and Horst Dittmann have been leading members of the Ballet of the Oper Leipzig. A performance of emotional richness combined with the stories of their lives, from Mary Wigman, Gret Palucca to Heike Hennig. Nothing about them is old, except their age. Dancing with Time was produced as film for TV  and movie-theaters, as DVD and as book by Marion Appelt, with a preface of Renate Schmidt.
