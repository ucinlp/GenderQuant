The film tells the story of a Polish Resistance group which discovers details of the manufacture of the German V-1 'Flying Bomb' at Peenem√ºnde in 1943. Liasing with service chiefs in London, the group manage to pass on enough information to convince them to launch a bombing raid and, in the climax to the film, are able to 'steal' a V-1 which lands in a field during testing and arrange for its transport back to the UK.
