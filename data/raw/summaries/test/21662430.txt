It's the story of Karan  and Pooja , who are studying in the same college in Pune. They fall in love and everything seems to be going fine till one day, while visiting her brother in Mumbai, Pooja's flight is hijacked by a group of terrorists, following the arrest of their leader Ashraf-ul-Haq Mallik. Ironically, this hijack has been engineered by Pooja's brother Vijay Varma , who is in league with the terrorist head Akhmash Jalal. Vijay is unaware of the fact that his beloved sister is on board the same flight. When he realises this, he is unable to do anything as Akhmash forbids him from doing anything that would jeopardise their mission. Karan daringly risks his life and rescues Pooja and the other passengers while ridding of all the hijackers on the plane, thus inviting the wrath of Akhmash and Vijay. Akhmash is now out to kill Karan. On the other hand, Vijay puts his foot down when Pooja reveals her intentions of marrying Karan. Pooja and Karan decide to escape, but they are chased and nabbed by Akhmash and his men and held captive in his den. Akhmash then tries to blackmail the Indian government by demanding the release of his leader Ashraf-ul-Haq Mallik as ransom for the lives of Karan and Pooja.The Indian government decides to release Ashraf-ul-Haq Mallik to rescue Karan.In the last scene there is a fight between Karan and the terrorists and all are killed including Ashraf-ul-Haq Mallik and Karan and Pooja are united. This was the most successful film of Karan to date, and was an above-average grosser that year and was highly popular among the masses. It also has arguably the most audacious helicopter stunt flying in Bollywood, done by Col Shaili Sharma, piloting a Bell 206L at knee-height in restricted rocky terrain near Hyderabad. This becomes the high point of the film towards the climax, along with the uplifting soulful qawwaali "Allah Allah" composed with zest by Nadeem Shravan
