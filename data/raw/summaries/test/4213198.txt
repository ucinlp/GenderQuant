Molly McGrath , is the daughter of a famed football coach who's dying to head her own team. When her wish is finally granted, Molly leaves her job coaching girls' track at an affluent high school  to take over a football team at an inner-city high school --the kind of place where guard dogs are needed to patrol the campus. At first the new coachâ€™s idealism and optimism are suffocated with racial and gender prejudice, but eventually her overriding spirit begins to whip her unruly team into shape. At the same time, she must also struggle to win a battle for the custody of her two young daughters. The real test for Molly comes when her Central High team faces Prescott in the city championship.
