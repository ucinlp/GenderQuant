Leo Tego  is in a prison of the Dominican Republic, ranting about corporations holding back the electric car and starting wars for oil while, on the streets, Alejandro Venegas  chats to an old man unable to find enough gas. Han Seoul-Oh  arrives and is collected from the airport by Cara Mirtha  and Malo . They drive him back to Santos' house, where his aunt Rubia  is struggling with rising prices linked to the cost of gas and Dominic Toretto  is working on his car. The team then enjoy a welcome meal with the family. After breaking Leo out of prison, they head to a club, where Han and Cara flirt while Dominic meets up with local politician Elvis , who informs them of a window of opportunity to hijack a gas shipment. While relaxing at the club afterwards, Dominic is surprised by the arrival of Leticia Ortiz , who has tracked him from Mexico. The two drive together to the beach, where they rekindle their relationship.
