The story is a family drama and the conflict between two brothers who share the legacy of Ezhuthupura, a newspaper company owned by family. Their roles as the main writers and publisher of a daily newspaper come to the forefront of their rivalry with each other. While one brother Devan has a clinical, business oriented attitude to growing the newspaper industry that he heads, the younger brother Mohanlal feels very emotional and passionate about the craft of writing and reporting. He gives everything to enriching his relationships and cannot understand how to approach it with business goals because writing, in itself, marks tradition, legacy and so much more in their family of distinguished writers. How the younger brother won his legacy is the rest of film.
