The story begins in the Russian countryside, where Rasputin heals the sick wife of an innkeeper . When he is later hauled before an Orthodox bishop for his sexual immorality and violence, the innkeeper springs to the monk's defence. Rasputin protests that he is sexually immoral because he likes to give God "sins worth forgiving". He also claims to have healing powers in his hands, and is unperturbed by the bishop's accusation that his power is from Satan. Rasputin heads for St. Petersburg, where he forces his way into the home of Dr Zargo , from where he begins his campaign to gain influence over the Tsarina . He manipulates the Tsarina's lady-in-waiting, Sonia , whom he uses to satisfy his voracious sexual appetite and gain access to the Tsarina. However, Rasputin's ruthless pursuit of wealth and prestige, and increasing control over the royal household attracts opposition. Sonia's brother, Peter , enraged by Rasputin's seduction of his sister, enlists the help of Ivan to bring about the monk's downfall.
