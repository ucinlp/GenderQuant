{{Plot}} Several boys are in their cabin lighting farts. After taking the lighter and attempting to light his own fart but falling short of the other boys' efforts, Alan  threatens Eddie , Mark , Billy  and Pee Pee , but is soon stopped by camp counselor, Randy , who is irritated with him. After a failed camp announcement by the owner in the dining hall, Alan gets into a violent confrontation with Randy after he complains about the food. Ronnie  allows Alan to go the kitchen to get something else to eat so as not to exascerbate the fight, but Alan ends up in trouble again, this time with cook Mickey , who throws eggs at him. Alan then throws a butcher knife at Mickey and the camp owner, Frank , seeing what he did, argues with Alan after already being annoyed by his past misbehavior. Alan, suffering from Bipolar disorder, runs away feeling rejected, with his stepbrother Michael  chasing after him. After being threatened, Michael goes back to the camp, telling Alan that he does not care what he does any more. In the kitchen, Mickey is killed after being held above and dumped into the deep fryer by an unseen character while cooking fries for dinner. His body is then dumped in the trash compactor. During the social, Alan is fooled by Terry "Weed"  and Stan  into smoking dried cow manure, mistaking it for marijuana which makes him cough and falls on Stan's crotch, earning him the nickname "Blowjob", which sticks and later plays a significant role in the film. After the social, a high Weed is tied to a chair and gas is squirted down his throat. The killer then sticks a lit-up cigarette in his mouth and his insides explode, killing him. Ronnie starts to suspect that the murders that happened twenty five years ago are happening again. Frank, in an attempt to ignore bad publicity, states that the murders were accidental and the camp continues to go on with its normal activities. A week later, Alan is bullied by being shot during a paintball game by all the players. In order to steal Karen  away from Alan , Michael makes Alan look like a psychopath by skinning the frogs Alan sits with in the forest. Karen and her friend Marie  run away. Alan is again bulled by T.C.  and Chooch , who give him a wedgie in front of everyone at the waterfront. That night, Michael, T.C. and Marie force Karen to lure Alan to the back of the stage, where they take his clothes off, tie him up, blindfold him and embarrass him in front of everyone at the social. Ronnie suspects that counselor Petey  is the killer for being everywhere when Alan is in trouble. Suddenly outside, T.C. and nine others start calling Alan "Blowjob", which causes him to become frustrated and run off into the night. After returning to his cabin, Frank is knocked unconscious with a hammer and wakes up with his head inserted in a birdcage. The killer opens up the birdcage, places two rats inside and locks it. The rats eat through his head and down into his intestines, killing him. Meanwhile, Randy and Linda  go to the pump house to have sex. Whilst Randy is pissing, an unseen person ties him to a tree, using fishing line as a noose to wrap around his penis. Suddenly, Linda becomes happy  after hearing Randy attempt to placate the killer , and drives off in the jeep, but the fishing line is tied to the jeep and, while driving at 85 mph, tears Randy's penis off, gorily killing him. Linda continues to drive, but crashes after driving through a wrapped barbed wire line, which wraps around her face, killing her. At the camp, F.C. has been grounded for the rest of the summer for bullying Alan. After Spaz  visits him again, a wooden spear comes through a hole in the floor while T.C. is looking into it and cuts him in the eye, gruesomely killing him. Meanwhile, Jenny  and Ronnie find Frank dead in his office. They begin rounding up everyone left in the camp, as Ronnie believes that Angela has returned and resumed her murders. Bella  goes back to her cabin, where she finds that the bunk above her has been replaced with spikes. The killer, who is also in the cabin, jumps down from the rafters and lands on top of the top bunk, causing it to fall on Bella, piercing her with the spikes and killing her. Soon, T.C. and Bella are found dead and after the counselors leave, Ricky Thomas  is called by Sheriff Jerry, while Karen, who discovered Bella with Marie and ran off in fright, believing Alan committed the murder and she will be his next victim and after finding Randy's and Linda's corpses, bumps into the killer and faints. Karen wakes up at the rec hall with a rope hanging from a basketball hoop tied around her neck. The killer flips a switch to raise the net, causing Karen to be lifted off the ground. Michael comes in before Karen is killed, causing the killer to run off, and lowers the net. After Karen tells him that she thinks Alan is the killer, Michael grabs a mallet and goes after Alan, who he beats with the mallet. Suddenly, the killer appears behind Michael as the screen fades to black. Ronnie, Ricky and Jenny find a badly-wounded, but still alive Alan on the ground. As Ronnie questions Alan who is responsible for his injuries, Sheriff Jerry walks into view of Ronnie and Ricky, explaining through his mechanical voice box that kids never learn and are always mean, and declaring, "I've been waiting a long time for this. A long time." Confirming Ronnie's suspicions, it is then revealed that Sheriff Jerry is Angela Baker . Nearby, Ricky, Jenny and Ronnie find a nearly-dead Michael skinned alive on the ground as Angela laughs maniacally. She suddenly stops laughing and looks at the audience with a vicious expression on her face. Michael dies as the scene cuts to the end credits. After the ending credits are over, a clip is shown, which takes place three weeks prior to the events of the film. It shows that Angela had escaped from the psychiatric clinic she had been locked up in for twenty years. After somehow acquiring a car, Angela apparently disables it by causing a brake fluid leak and flags down Sheriff Pete , the real sheriff. She murders him by dropping the car on his head and, presumably, steals his clothes to become the new sheriff.
