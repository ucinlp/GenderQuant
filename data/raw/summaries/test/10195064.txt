In the hot summer of 1887, life seems idyllic when Isobel Hetherington and her three young daughters moved into their seaside residence. But when Phillip Wilson Steer arrives for his annual painting visit, a chain of events set off to change their lives forever. Overcome by his first sight of Isobel, Steer immediately decides to capture her on canvas; and as the painting grows, so does their love for each other. But jealousy and tragedy eventually force them to confront reality.
