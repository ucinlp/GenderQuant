The film opens with the hijacker leaving a plane by its aft airway on a clear day, parachuting into a forest in Washington. The man is later identified as Jim Meade , an ex-Army man with big dreams. Meade escapes the manhunt using a jeep he had previously hidden in the forest and concealing the money in the carcass of a deer. He eventually meets up with his estranged wife Hannah , who operates a river rafting company. Meanwhile, Meade is being hunted by Bob Gruen , an insurance investigator who was Meade's sergeant in the Army, and Meade's Army buddy Remson , who listened when Meade had talked about hijacking a plane. Gruen confronts the Meades at the rafting company, but they escape down the river. The Meades lead Gruen and Remson separately on a cross-country chase involving various stolen cars. Gruen is fired from the pursuit by his employer, yet continues the chase to claim the money for himself. At an air yard where the Meades acquire a hot-air balloon, Gruen steals the money from Hannah, and Meade chases him down with a barely-functioning biplane. Meade runs Gruen off the road and crashes the plane. They discuss how Gruen knew it was Meade; Gruen thought of him because of their history. Meade leaves Gruen with a couple bundles of the cash, and walks away with the rest, to be picked up by Hannah. At the end, Remson reaches a crossroads the Meades have just passed; thinking he sees their truck parked nearby, he continues the chase.
