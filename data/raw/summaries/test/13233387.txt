 Dil Dosti Etc explores the ambiguities of the youth years. The movie is about coming of age of Apurv , a rich, aimless and cynical 18 year old young man, who has just entered college in Delhi. Juxtaposed against the aimlessness of Apurv is also the story of Sanjay Mishra , an ambitious Bihari student & politician with limited means. They represent two divergent world views—the liberal versus the conservative, the no-strings attached versus the committed, the elite versus the middle-class. Directionless and laidback, Apurv searches for meaning in life through amorous escapades with different girls, including a sex-worker Vaishali  and a school girl Kintu . Meanwhile Sanjay works single-mindedly to win the college Presidential elections, and yet catches the attention of a rich model Prerna . Dil Dosti Etc is woven together with an ensemble of other characters, who have their own stories to tell. Set against all these is a silly wager that the two protagonists engage in. Sanjay will win the elections and Apurv will manage to have sex with three women in a day. As the film moves towards a volatile climax, you get to test the film’s premise, when you’re young, you believe the possibilities are endless.
