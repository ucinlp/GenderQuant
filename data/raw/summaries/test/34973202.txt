In the village of Tizangara, UN Blue Helmets work as peacekeepers after years of civil war. Five explosions kill five soldiers; only their helmets and their phalluses are left. Massimo Risi, an Italian Lieutenant posted in Maputo, Mozambiqueâ€™s capital, arrives in the village in order to investigate the events. Assisted by Joaquim, a local translator, Massimo starts the enquiry and soon discovers that not everything is what it appears to be.
