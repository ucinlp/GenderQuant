A group of women arrive by bus to a small town in the depopulated central Province of Guadalajara, where there is a scarcity of single women and economic opportunities. The men have organized an annual party to get to know available ladies with the hopes of falling in love and finding a wife. Women hope to find stability, companionship, immigration papers or a combination of the three. The group of women include: Marirrosi a divorced nurse from Bilbao who is lonely and looking for love; Patricia a young woman with two children from the Dominican Republic who has been in Spain illegally and unable to find work; and Milady a beautiful black young Cuban who wants to see the world at any cost. They come to the town filled with eager men but not lots of opportunities other than farming. Patricia settles with Damian, a hardworking farmer who lives with his mother, Gregoria. Looking to find stability for her young children and a hard worker herself, Patricia tries in vain to find common ground with her stern mother-in-law, who seems to reject her because of her skin color and the fact that her son is no longer under her control. Patrica, with more time and experience in Spain, befriends the newcomer Milady. Milady settles with Carmelo an older Spanish man who wooed her in Havana. Carmelo tries to impress her with a big television and modern kitchen, but what she really wants to do is go to discos and have fun. She is in no way ready to settle down. Her dream of a life in Europe is very different from his fantasy of life with a gorgeous young wife. Milady is flirty and does not love Carmelo. Wanting to see the ocean in Valencia, she takes a ride from a truck driver. When she comes back to town, the jealous Carmelo gives her a beating. Milady wishes she could leave him, but she has few friends a no real place to go. Marirrosi, the oldest of the three women, has a grown up son and is tired of her job in Bilbao. She finds love with Alfonso, a gentle soft spoken gardener. However, she is unwilling to give up city life for fields and cows while he is not made for city life. Unable to resolve their differences, she eventually breaks up with him. At the farm, Patricia receives the visit of some of her friends and this generates a confrontation with Gregoria, but Damian’s comes to Patricia’s defense and the relation between the two women improves. However the father of Patricia’s two children reappears in her life wanting to take advantage of her steadier situation. In a frank talk with Damian, Patricia admits that if she could have found work and been able to take care for herself either in the Dominican Republic or Spain, she probably wouldn't have married him. But now that she is there, she offers herself as a companion and as a stable love. Milady captures the attention of Oscar, a young man infatuated with her. He helps her escape the town but in a stop in a hotel he also leaves him, taking the road on her own. Damian and Patricia have an argument after her honest revelation. He believes that she is taken advantage of him and she decides to leave with her children. At the last minute, persuaded by his mother, Damian stops them for leaving and he and Patricia reconcile. At the local church, Patricia’s daughter makes her first communion. Alfonso is devastated when he receives Marirrosi’s letter breaking up with him. Carmelo deals alone with his disappointment of Milady’s sudden departure. At the village’s bar Alfonso gives some advice to the local single men. Another bus, full of hopeful single women, is arriving to town.
