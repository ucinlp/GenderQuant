A sightseeing bus enters the gates of a large estate through the courtesy of its owner, tree-loving millionaire Colonel Mulch. Woody, a hitchhiker atop the bus, hears the driver announce that the estate is noted for its rare and priceless trees. Woody immediately prepares for a delectable treat by putting on his napkin, and he goes to the arbor to sample the trees. Colonel Mulch, with a large magnifying glass, is inspecting some of the trees, and he suddenly sees an enlarged woodpecker standing on a bunch of one of them. The colonel does a double take and yells for his pet cat Filbert. When the cat arrives, it's immediately told to get rid of Woody. Filbert, hearing Woody pecking a tree, endeavors to carry out the order given to him. He uses various devices and tricks to catch Woody, but in every instance, Woody outsmarts him. As a last resort, Filbert tries to dynamite Woody from a tree hideout. The explosion causes a chain reaction, which fells tree after tree. At the point of a gun in the colonel's hands, Filbert tries to repair the damage with every device- from glue to needle and thread. The sightseeing tour having come to an end, the bus driver announces that they are leaving the "ruins" of Colonel Mulch's estate. Upon turning around to inform his passengers that the damage was caused by a woodpecker, he discovers that the only passenger left is Woody, who has made a shambles of the bus.
