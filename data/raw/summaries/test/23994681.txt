In this slapstick romantic comedy, Alexander Botts is egged on by his sweetheart Sally to do great things, so he writes a letter to the Earthworm Tractor company, and is hired as a salesman. He gets fired more than once, but is rehired by getting orders. He falls in love with Mabel, daughter of cranky Sam. Eventually he proves a super salesman by selling many tractors to Sam, and wins Mabel's love.Harrison's Reports film review; July 25, 1936, page 119.
