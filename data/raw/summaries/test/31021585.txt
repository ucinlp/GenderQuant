Roger Bradley  is the son the owner of a milk company. He wants to get a job as a milkman at his father's company, but his father denies it because of Roger's after-war trauma: when he gets stressed or frustrated, he quacks like a duck. Roger gets upset at his father and does not see any problem with the quacking. In revenge, he gets a job with his father's arch-rival, Breezy Albright  at another milk company. He becomes very successful and quickly falls in love with the boss's daughter, Chris Abbott .
