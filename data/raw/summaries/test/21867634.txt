Roach and Starbuck, two hardcore punks from Montreal, try to form their own political party, but run out of time due to Canada's electoral process. Instead, they decide to campaign for political office as independent candidates in a rich Montreal district called Outremont.McGill Daily - Voting From the Streets As they hit the campaign trail in one of Canada's wealthiest communities, each wants to do it his own way. While Roach proposes to reform the "rotting electoral system" as he calls it, Starbuck's punk rock performance art is designed to shock the electorate into waking the up. Roach mounts a media campaign proposing proportional representation; Starbuck campaigns door-to-door wearing a leather cape and a dildo, telling voters: "If you like it up the a**, vote Liberal!".Official synopsis from EyeSteelFilm website
