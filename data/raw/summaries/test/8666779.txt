First part of the film tells about personal lives of the air crew, their problems and relationships. One of the pilots needed to exchange a promising career to the less ambitious one because of the family. He have done but the wife feels he is not happy that makes her a very conflicting and angry partner as well. While both parents love their son, this does not protect the family from divorce. The pilot, however, returns to work with the large passenger planes he was missing. Another pilot is not believing into family at all - his own flat is full of impressive self-made light effects and son et lumi√®re that he uses to attract new and new women just for night. The second, dramatic part lands the Tu-154 Aeroflot airplane in city of "Bidri" located somewhere in Middle East in Caucasus. The city gets destroyed by an earthquake, and the damaged runway is no longer suitable for regular take off . Still, there is no other way as to fly because the airport will soon be buried by the coming avalanche. The experienced crew captain decides to take advantage that this is a mountain airport and the plane can actually fly down rather than up near immediately after it leaves the runway. In addition, the warning "not ready for flight" appears in the dashboard but the plane manages to take off at the last moment. The captain insists on rapid, but full take off protocol, checking the aircraft following the rules. It might be that his idea is to calm the crew, setting it the normal work. While taking off in the immediate proximity of the avalanche, the plane undergoes severe damage: an airport projector is jammed in the altitude controls and the tail section is cracked. The two previously described pilots volunteer to repair the plane's tail and rudder. They return severely wounded and covered by ice crust. Panic rose, but the captain again manages to calm the situation, asking stewardess to deliver coffee like usual. During landing in Moscow the crew discovers that the brakes are not working well enough to stop the plane in the heavy rain conditions. The captain commands his crew to turn on the thrust reversal, ripping off the tail. The now detached tail burns but the remainder of the plane stays away from fire and all people on board escape. During the next medical certification the aged captain does not get further permission to fly due to heart problems. He is shown accepting this very heavily and does not show the former coolness and self-control the he demonstrated while leading the crash-landing plane. Hence all three figures  behave as much more mature personalities under extremal circumstances than in their ordinary daily life.
