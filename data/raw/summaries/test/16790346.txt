In the North Atlantic off the coast of Greenland, a highly advanced deep sea oil rig has been recently constructed by a company, Nexecon Petroleum. The oil rig is named "Colossus" for its immense size. This "new" type of oil rig can dig deeper, and extract more oil than any other oil rig in the world. The fact that this huge rig has been built on fault lines alarms the geologists around the world. They are concerned that the delicate ocean floor fault lines in that region can be disturbed through deep drilling and consequences would be extremely catastrophic. A reporter, Christen Giddings, has been invited by the CEO of Nexecon, Peter Brazier, to document the oil rig in an attempt to address the concerns of the geologists. Christen is accompanied by a trusted cameraman Jake Thompson, who would record their findings. The oil rig's crew seems to be convinced that nothing bad would happen, and is skeptical of the geologists. Brazier hopes that a documented report of the Colossus would reveal that his rig has all the necessary safety arrangements and the region is stable enough for a digging operation. As the drilling commences, a rich oil deposit is discovered. However, further drilling is not stopped and an "ocean floor fault line" gets ruptured. The rupture opens a portal to a "mirror" ocean hidden under the normal ocean for millions of years. This ocean contains prehistoric life. The flowing oil begins to poison the waters and as the result, prehistoric animals rush to the surface. An explosion soon occurs and the drilling system collapses. A team of highly skilled engineers descend through a glass elevator to assess the situation. A giant animal is spotted lurking nearby, surprising the crew. Initially the animal is suspected to be a large whale because of its intimidating size but a few remain skeptical, since this creature is moving very fast. Once the giant creature gets closer to the elevator, the onlookers get the shock of their lives, realizing that this beast is, in fact, the most powerful and fearsome oceanic predator that ever lived, Carcharodon megalodon. A struggle for survival ensues as the crew and geologists attempt to escape from Colossus. However several people fall victim to the unfriendly prehistoric beast. In a desperate move to stop the monster shark, one of the crew members, Ross, lures it to an open space via his small submarine and overloads the fuel tanks of the machine which results in a gigantic explosion, killing him and the beast. The ordeal is not over yet as another Megalodon ventures in to open waters passing below a boat with Christen Giddings on board. However she is unaware of its presence.
