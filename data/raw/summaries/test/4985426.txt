Intense young "tough" Thomas Seyr is a 28-year old real estate broker involved in shady business deals. His business partners, Fabrice and Sami, spend much of their time ruthlessly chasing squatters and illegal immigrants out of the buildings they have procured and trying to work their way around government housing regulations. Thomas is born to this kind of work; his father, Robert, is also involved in dodgy enterprises and sometimes calls upon Thomas to take care of unpleasant business . Tom shows a protective and defensive attitude to his father who doesn't always appreciate what his son does for himâ€“so much so that when his father introduces his new girlfriend to Tom, Tom undermines her to her face, and insults her to his father. Though she is a model, he decides she is "a whore." Later, when he tries to enlist her help to watch over his father, she tells him they broke up due to Robert changing his attitude and she is aware of Tom's backstabbing because Robert told her. Robert by this time is in danger from a Russian gangster, Minskov  who scammed him of a great deal of money and Tom is worried for his safety. On the side, Tom wants to be a pianist like his mother and finds a teacher, virtuoso Miao Lin, to prepare for an audition opportunity. She speaks only Chinese, Vietnamese and some English, but no French. Eventually Tom reaches the high standards of his teacher while carrying on a relationship with the wife of one of his business partners. Stretched to the limit and overtired, he fails to complete the audition. He goes to see his father only to find the apartment destroyed and his father murdered. Tom is devastated. Cut to two years later where Tom is Miao Lin's manager and partner, organising her schedule, her performances and being by her side. Just before a concert, he chances to see Minskov, takes him by surprise in the stairwell, gives him a beating on the stairs and threatens to use his own gun against him, before deciding to spare him. The film closes with Tom in the audience, knuckles and shirt bloody, exchanging slow-burning looks with Miao Lin at the piano.
