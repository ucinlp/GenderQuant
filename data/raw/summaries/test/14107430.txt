At the end of the 1920-s the Finnish government proclaimed dry law which lasted 12 years. Estonian bootleggers living on the neighboring coast of the Gulf of Finland profited from prohibition which staggered Finnish economy. In the fishermen's fictional village called Ropsi accedes a new honest chief of the border guard station, lieutenant Aleksander Kattai  who wants to "lay down the law and order". At the same time the most famous of the village's spirit-smugglers, Eerik Ekström  drives over the Gulf of Finland with his queuely firewater-cargo. He has spirit cans in his boat and also behind it in the sequential position  Lieutenant Kattai sees on those days Hilda Sibul, the Ekström's fiancée. This role performs by an actress Epp Eespäev. They fall in love, but their good relationship does not last long. In this point start the thrilling escapes and catchings, the plot's sting of the tails. Lieutenant Kattai finds out the very high governmental circles are involved to "the Ropsi firewater-smuggling case". An Estonian minister Tui  and a high-rank officer of the Estonian Navy papa Nymann  profit the contrabandism and want to bull through dry law also in the Estonian parliament. Minister Tui agitates for dry law using extremely hypocritical methods . Lieutenant Kattai's background is interesting, so he opens himself: "I am lieutenant Kattai, a former soldier of armoured train unit number two. After the war I remained with the border of guard. Until now I was at the southern border, near Pihkva. There was firing every day, Russian salesmen and smugglers, red agents." Those facts indicate to the Estonian War of Independence.
