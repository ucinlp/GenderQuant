{{Expand section}} Sophia Loren plays a poor Greek sponge diver who accidentally finds an ancient Greek statue of a boy riding a dolphin on the bottom of the Aegean Sea. Her efforts to sell it to the highest bidder lead her to two competing individuals - Alan Ladd, an honest archaeologist with an academic's bankroll, and Clifton Webb, a wealthy but unscrupulous art collector. Ladd  is committed to seeing the statue handed over to the rightful Greek authorities. Webb  seeks to outwit him and add the treasure to his private collection. Loren throws in with Parmalee, but ends up romantically involved with Ladd, with predictable complications all round.
