The story follows 72 hours in the life of Frank Pierce , a burnt-out paramedic, in 1990. Frank is a Manhattan medic working the graveyard shift in a two-man ambulance team. Usually exhausted and depressed, Frank sees ghosts walking the streets, particularly that of a young woman he failed to save six months before. He is assigned a shift per day, each with a different partner: Larry , Marcus , and Tom . While working with them, he befriends the daughter of a heart-attack victim he brought in, Mary , an ex-junkie. Between rounds, Frank battles against the massive effects of a new form of heroin that is hitting the streets, as well as his own psychological demons.
