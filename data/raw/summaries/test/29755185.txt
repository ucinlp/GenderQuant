Dr. Quack is trying to keep Daffy quiet for him to do the operation, but Daffy gets too insane when he was barking orders . Daffy is kicked out into an "artificial lung" machine that inflates Daffy's body parts. Insulted, he decides to get his own patient. Daffy grabs a mallet, puts it behind his back, and starts to look for a patient. While back in the operating room, Dr. Quack had finished fixing the patient  and started to play with it. Daffy looks out the window for a patient where sees Porky strolling by. Daffy jumps out of the window and follows him . He carries Porky in on a stretcher to use as his patient. Later, Porky is lying in a bed with a thermometer in his mouth . Daffy is listening to Porky's heartbeat with a giant ragged stethoscope. After Daffy pulls the "thermometer" out of Porky's mouth, Porky tries to tell him that he's not sick, but Daffy ignores him and thrusts it back into his mouth. He then states that he must hold a consultation. He then knocks himself on the head and three images of himself appear. They talk about what to do when they all agree that an operation is in order. Daffy reaches into his medical bag and pulls out a big saw. He walks over to Porky, pulls the covers down and lifts his gown to operate. When Porky sees what he is going to do he yells, "Hey! W-W-What's the big idea?" A chase though the hospatal emerges. Porky runs through a door, slams it and holds it to try to keep Daffy out only to find Daffy standing behind the door where he greets Porky with a cheery "Hello chum!" Porky panics and crashes through the door and Daffy runs after him. He runs through the hallway with Daffy right behind him. Daffy catches up with Porky and grabs the end of his gown. Porky and Daffy crash into the machine that was seen earlier. After it spits them both out, their bodies inflate and deflate.
