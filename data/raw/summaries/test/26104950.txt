Govindaiah , a pleader gumasta wants Raja to marry Chitti. She, however, loves an endearing bodybuilder to whom by traditional obligations, she rightfully belongs. Govindaiah makes Raja's marriage to Chitti on the precondition for helping to find a husband for Raja's sister Ammadu . Raja rejects the deal and, with his younger brother, sets out to find a groom for Ammadu. In a distant village, he meets Zamindar Veeyanna , a complex character of declining fortunes and generous spirit who, as Panchayat President, also serves as a representative of the state. Raju and Veeyanna's daughter Savitri  fall in love and their wedding is quickly arranged. Veeyanna also finds a groom, Ramana , for Ammadu, but Ramana's father Venkatapathy is a puranam-reciting scrooge who demands a large dowry, which Veeyanna promises to pay. Govindaiah meanwhile plots his own revenge on the wedding day, inciting Venkatapathy to insist on the dowry being paid before the marriage. The narrative that follows is 'staged' by the new couple with the help of Raja, Savitri and others. Ramana pretends to give in to his father's demands to cal the wedding off, but starts living with Ammadu and, when his father arrives, feigns mental illness while Ammadu and Raja disguise themselves as nurse and doctor. Ammadu endears to Venkatapathy by showing interest in his puranam recitals. The groom 'recovers' from the madness and Ammadu gives birth to their son, causing a fresh round of gossip in the village and providing the original villain Govindaiah with yet another opportunity to make trouble. The crisis is resolved following a relapse of insanity on the part of Ramana, as well as the discovery of Ammadu's baby, before the uncaring parents relent and couples are reunited.
