The movie Gamma Squad tells the story of an elite squad of soldiers in the U.S. army called, incidentally, "Gamma Squad". After discovering that two vital outposts have been taken by the enemy , General Somers tells General Conner that he is going to send in a rescue mission for the men still alive at the outposts, but that he cannot risk his best men for the mission . He thus decides to send in Gamma Squad. General Conner says to Somers in protest that it is a suicide mission, to which General Somers replies that he is aware. He reasons that by going in, "they'll be dubbed heroes. More heroes means more support; more support, more recruits." He also comments that by the time they arrive, there'll be no one left to rescue. Upon hearing this, Conner calls Somers crazy, and says to him, "You're fuckin' nuts!" Somers then slaps Conner, and tells him that if he again questions Somers' orders, he'll be sent out to fight. In the end, Conner issues the order for Gamma Squad's deployment. The final scene opens with what is assumed to be Gamma Squad, a five-person team, composed of Alloy, Muller, Barker, Lash, and their commander, Wolf, hiking through a creek bed. While walking through the forest, they are ambushed by the enemy and Alloy is killed by enemy fire. Muller and Wolf scatter off to one side, and Barker and Lash both move to forward positions. Wolf orders Muller to move ahead; he complies and in doing so steps on a landmine, dying instantly. Barker takes a shot, quipping "Poor bastard should have had a better hiding place like mine!" and is killed by a gunshot to the head immediately thereafter. Lash rushes to Barker to briefly consider the implications of his comrade's death. Finally, Wolf runs up toward Lash but is shot on the way. The gunfire stops, and Lash is the only one left alive. In a final act of desperation and mourning, he draws his pistol to his head. The film cuts before Lash's fate is resolved.
