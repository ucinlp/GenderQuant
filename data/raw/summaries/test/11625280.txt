He leaves to find Khush attacked, and Khush says "Tanya" as he holds a piece of red fabric. Karan follows a car which has Natasha and Tanya in it to a cliff, and finds Natasha injured. She tells him that Professor Bakshi bought her and Tanya here. Karan realises she is lying, as Professor Bakshi was with him, and also realises the piece of fabric Khush had in his hand came off Natasha's scarf. He asks Natasha why she attacked everyone, and she claims it because she loved him. She begs him to forgive her, but he is speechless. She says that after finding this out, he won't forgive her, so she walks backwards in the snow and falls off the edge, yelling Karan's name. He runs to save her, but is unsuccessful, and her scarf blows into his face. On the first day of college, Karan remembers each of his friends who died, including Natasha. While on the plane back to Delhi, he meets Tanya again, and they decide to be with each other, while they find Yash in the back seat.
