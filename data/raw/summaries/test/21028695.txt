The title of the movie Aayiram Poi  means A 1000 lie in Tamil. An old Tamil saying goes like "Its alright to tell a 1000 lies to make a marriage work" and this movie closely follows that old adage. Chinnadurai intensely dislikes his Brother-in-law, Kanakasabai owing to an insult in the past. So Chinnadurai stands in the way of a marriage arrangement for his daughter, Malathi and Kanagasabai's son Ravi . The film deals with how Ravi's resourcefulness helps him in getting Malathi's hand in marriage.
