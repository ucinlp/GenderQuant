Jinbei Masuda, a Japanese Christian of the samurai class, draws his strength from his faith, family, and fencing. However, he is caught up in the shogunâ€™s policy of religious persecution and must choose between his loved ones and his God. Ships from Europe brought Christianity to the shores of Japan in 1549. For decades the seeds of faith grew under the watchful gaze of the Shogun. But the fear of foreign influence eventually gave rise to persecution. By 1624, Japanese Christians enjoyed only a few more years of peace.
