Lilian Harvey, the toast of two continents, is her usual radiant self in Invitation to the Waltz. Harvey plays Jenny Peachey , a Drury Lane ballerina during the Napoleonic Wars. Swept off her slippers by the handsome Duke of Wurtemberg , Jenny gives up her dancing career to become the Duke's mistress. As the war between England and France intensifies, our heroine uses her influence to persuade the Duke to sign a treaty with England, thereby helping to bring about the downfall of Napoleon . Through it all, Jenny is worshipped from afar by handsome Lieutenant Carl . Magnificently produced, Invitation to the Waltz was a lighthearted follow-up to Lillian Harvey's more serious "ballerina sacrifices all" opus, Schwartze Rosen.http://www.allmovie.com/work/invitation-to-the-waltz-96716
