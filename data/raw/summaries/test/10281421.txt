Visconti's retelling of the Electra story starts with Sandra/Electra  returning to her ancestral home in Italy - and reviving an intimate involvement with her brother  which troubles her naive American husband ([[Michael Craig  - on the eve of an official ceremony commemorating the death of her Jewish father in a Nazi concentration camp. As ever with Visconti, he is ambivalently drawn to the decadent society he is ostensibly criticising; and Armando Nannuzzi's camera lovingly caresses the creaking old mansion, set in a landscape of crumbling ruins, where the incestuous siblings determine to wreak revenge on the mother  and stepfather  who supposedly denounced their father. Something like a Verdi opera without the music, the result may not quite achieve tragedy, but it looks marvellous. The title, culled from the poem "Le ricordanze"Leopardi's poem full text at http://www.pensieriparole.it/poesie/poesie-d-autore/poesia-18146; English translation at Google Books by Giacomo Leopardi, could be translated as 'Glimmering stars of the Great Bear', and has a strong resonance with the movie's plot: : Vaghe stelle dell'Orsa, io non credea : Tornare ancor per uso a contemplarvi : Sul paterno giardino scintillanti, : E ragionar con voi dalle finestre : Di questo albergo ove abitai fanciullo, : E delle gioie mie vidi la fine. English translation: : Glimmering stars of the Great Bear, : I never thought I'd be back to see you : Shining down on my father's garden, : Nor talk to you ever again from the windows : Of this house where I spent my childhood : And saw the last of my happiness vanish.
