 Police Inspector Dillon  reluctantly sets out to see an old friend, Dan O'Flaherty ([[Noel Purcell . Along the way, he encounters Mickey J. , a poitín maker who, fortunately for him, is not Dillon's target today. The inspector has the unfortunate duty of serving a warrant on O'Flaherty for striking Phelim O'Feeney ([[John Cowley  on the head. O'Flaherty refuses to pay the fine, as he feels he has done nothing wrong, nor will he allow O'Feeney to pay it for him. Instead, he heads off to prison.  A train pulls up to the Dunfaill station, where Paddy Morrisey  announces there will be "a minute's wait". The passengers and crew crowd into the bar for refreshments, served by Pegeen Mallory . Later, Paddy finally proposes to his longtime girlfriend Pegeen. Mrs. Falsey  chats with her old friend Barney Domigan , while her niece Mary Ann MacMahon  becomes acquainted with his son Christy . Domigan is on his way to arrange a marriage between Christy and a young woman with a substantial dowry. Mrs. Falsey persuades him to change his mind by informing him that the U.S. Army has awarded Mary Ann $10,000 for her father's death in battle. The young couple, unaware of this development, insist they will only marry each other. Meanwhile, the train is repeatedly delayed, much to the befuddlement of an older English couple . They are first displaced from their first class compartment to make way for a prize-winning goat. Then, they have to share their new compartment with lobsters intended for the bishop's golden jubilee. When they finally get off for some tea, they are left behind when the train finally departs.  Sean Curran  awaits his execution by the British during the "Black and Tan War". This is very unpopular with the Irish public who consider him a hero. The British warden  allows two "nuns" , one of them his grieving "sister", to visit him; the false sister  swaps clothes and places with him. Unsuspecting Police Sergeant Michael O'Hara  helps the pair into a waiting carriage. He notices that one is wearing high heels, but thinks little of it. The city is immediately sealed off as the manhunt for the fugitive begins. O'Hara is assigned to watch a section of the waterfront and daydreams of what he could do with the £500 bounty. Already conflicted by divided loyalties, he is visited by his overtly nationalistic wife . Then, Curran shows up disguised as itinerant ballad singer Jimmy Walsh. O'Hara is suspicious and has him sing; Curran chooses the patriotic "The Rising of the Moon". Despite his unconvincing rendition, he manages to slip away on a boat sent for him while O'Hara bickers with his wife. When the policeman sees Curran getting away, he starts to raise the alarm, then reconsiders and starts singing "The Rising of the Moon" himself.
