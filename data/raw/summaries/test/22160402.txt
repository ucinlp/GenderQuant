In the English city of Birmingham, a policeman, constable Charles Baron , is involved in a confrontation with an individual who is believed to be a local vagrant. It is soon found out to be a saboteur who has left a suitcase full of detonators and bomb making components at the railway yard. Upon realising that the individual at the yard was attempting to sabotage a trainload of sea mines, destined for the Naval Yard at Portsmouth, the police prevent the train from leaving. However, the wagons are in a residential area and the police have to evacuate local residents. The local authorities get in contact with former Royal Canadian Artillery bomb specialist Peter Lyncort , who is living in the city with his French wife Janie  and working for Vickers-Armstrongs, Ltd. Lyncort agrees to help, when the city's security chief Jim Warrilow  calls. Lyncort's wife had walked out on him after their tenth fight in just one month. The police set a trap for the saboteur, who had planned and set up the scheme, by stationing police at Portsmouth railway station knowing that he, the saboteur, will be there to see the fruits of his labours like an arsonist who stays at the scene of his crime. Spotted by Constable Baron the suspect is apprehended and flown by helicopter back to Birmingham to help Lyncort and his new assistant, Warilow, find and disarm the explosive charge hidden in one of the hundreds of underwater mines. During this Janine remains unaware of the actions her husband is undertaking. Coming home to make up with Lyncort she finds the hotel room empty at 3&nbsp;am and starts making phone calls to all the local hospitals, fearing Lyncort has been involved in an accident. Eventually, Janie finds out where her husband is and arrives just in time to see Lyncort save the city.
