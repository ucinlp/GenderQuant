After the death of her father, Natalie Travers  discovers he was married to a rodeo star before he married Natalie's mother. Upset that her father kept part of his life a secret from her and bewildered over how a prominent judge could fall for a cowgirl, she sets out to find Maggie Mae Jarrett. But Natalie meets her daughter Jessie Mae Jarrett  who is struggling to keep the wild horses on her land alive and safe. Thicker than water is a classic example of a film that has more background music, than people actually talking.
