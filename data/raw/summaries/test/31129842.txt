The film revolves around five central characters in the city of Mumbai. Tilak  is a small time publisher of pirated books who along with his friends Mandook  and Ramesh  kidnaps a famous author and forces him to give the manuscript of his latest book to them so that they will be the first ones to publish it. Abhay  is a NRI who returns to India to start his own small business and meets Shalmili . Sawan  is a young cricketer hoping to break into the under-22 Mumbai cricket team. The story focuses on their trials and tribulations as they battle life in the city of Mumbai during the chaotic period of the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi. The film tries to deal with concepts of chance, the constant struggle between hope and despair and self-actualization. The opening of the movie starts with the song "Karma is a bitch" which fits in with the central theme of the story where the characters of the film keep trying to come to terms with their own actions. Abhay has a dark past which is not revealed in the film but it can be speculated that he came to India to stay away from it. Tilak initially holds himself responsible for the tragic accident that happens in the movie which brings him closer to his wife and viewing life from a different perspective. The goons who traumatize Abhay eventually end up being shot by their own bullets on the day of Ganesha Visarjan indicating to an extent the influence of "God" in the movie. Tilak gets a new life and finds his treasure at home. Sawan who is financially pressed decides to keep the money he finds at the bank robbery and gives up on the cricket selections- a choice he could have well chosen not to take. Towards the end of the movie all characters move on different paths.
