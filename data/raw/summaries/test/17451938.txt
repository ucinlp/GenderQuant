During the Second World War Jimmy Bancroft , a fighter pilot just released from hospital, and his nurse  Hazel Broome  are on a walking tour through the countryside. They arrive at the fictional village of Lipsbury Lea and being keen birdwatchers, discover that a pair of tawny pipits, which are rarely seen in England, are nesting nearby. Staying in the village, they enlist the locals to protect the nesting site until the eggs hatch. The villagers do so with great enthusiasm, led by the fiery retired Colonel Barton-Barrington  and the Reverend Mr. Kingsley. Unfortunately, the field where the nest is located  is due to be ploughed up by order of the county agricultural committee, and a delegation to the Ministry of Agriculture in London fails to get the order rescinded. Fortunately, the Minister was Barton-Barrington's junior at school, and personally intervenes to save the field from being ploughed. The eggs duly hatch, but not before a plot to steal the eggs on behalf of an unscrupulous dealer is foiled by an alert army corporal  who is serving nearby.
