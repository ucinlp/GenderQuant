Chandrolsavam is a film that deals with a very unusual theme - a man trying to redeem his past. It's a film about a man's love for his nostalgia. Shreehari, the protagonist, was compelled to leave his village and home after being convicted for plotting a murder, and returns home after living as a musician in Paris for five years. Back home, he tries to get back every moment of his past-his teenage romance, the sights and sounds that he had once savoured because he does not have much life left, he is afflicted with cancer. Chandrolsavam is about Shreehari's celebration of his life, love, friendships and memories. It tells the story of a man in search of his past and through it shows man's unending love for the life he has lived.
