Seth Badri Prasad, a rich man who was the childhood friend of Ramsh Chander, bails out Deepak from the bankruptcy problem, requests all of Ramesh's creditors, to whom Ramesh had pledged the bungalow for loans, to not to file suit against Deepak and that they should auction the bunglow and he would by himself buy it. When Deepak comes to know of this, he feels indebted to Seth Badri Prasad. Since Deepak became an adult, Badri Prasad had been forcing his friend Ramesh Chander to ask Deepak to marry Asha . After Deepak returns to Bombay, his mother suggests him that he should now get settled in his life and bring some happiness in his life and for that he needs to marry Asha. After much hesitation, Deepak marries Asha, his childhood friend and daughter of Badri Prasad. During the wedding, Deepak observes that among the audience, there is woman who looks similar to Jyoti.

As a year goes by Jyoti and Asha become very close friends. Asha discloses that her husband is not loving her and that although a year has passed since their wedding day, her husband does not even come close to her.
