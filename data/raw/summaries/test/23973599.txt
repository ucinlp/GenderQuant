Absent-minded department store owner Henry Butler, Harry Langdon, ends up working late, and missing the surprise anniversary party thrown by his wife, Effie, Betty Blythe. Trying to get away from work, he ends up being seen with a mannequin, which he is trying to get repaired. Their friends who see it, think itâ€™s a blonde girl. Others call the police, reporting a murdered woman. Henry gets picked up by the police; but, his troubles are just starting. Effie has overheard the gossip; and, files for a divorce, urged on by her friend, Grace Norman, Esther Muir, and her unscrupulous lawyer, Gilbert Wayne, Gayne Whitman. When Effie decides to stop the divorce, a little scene staged by the lawyer, with his girlfriend, Nan, Florence Wright, posing as the blonde, Henry was supposedly seeing, convinces her otherwise. It is only then, that her niece Jane, Luana Walters, and her friend, Bob Grant, Bob Byrd, notice that the shoe Henry brought back that night is about a size four. Henry drags the mannequin, Carole , all over town; only to meet the police, and Effie, waiting for him; and, her lawyer, at Home.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/83590/Misbehaving-Husbands/
