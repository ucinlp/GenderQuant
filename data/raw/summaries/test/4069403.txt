Sharon, a young Los Angeles woman, engages in a swinging, libidinous lifestyle with Vic, her male partner. She comes into contact with a sect that advises her that a true Rapture is imminent. In time, she comes to accept this belief herself and becomes a born-again Christian. She begins a new, pious lifestyle, eventually marrying and having a daughter, Mary. When her husband Randy is killed in a senseless murder, however, she begins to question the benevolence of God. She believes she must wait with Mary in the desert for the coming of the Rapture. A police officer named Foster is concerned for their well-being, but Sharon is persistent that the end is near. She eventually loses patience. At her daughter's urging, Sharon decides to hasten their ascendance to heaven. She kills Mary with a gunshot. However, she is unable to take her own life afterwards, afraid she'll be condemned as a suicide. She confesses to what she had done to Foster and is arrested and placed in the local jail. Until this point, the film appears to be a story about a born-again cultist whose beliefs eventually lead to murder, but, in a twist ending, the Rapture does indeed arrive. While Sharon is sitting in her cell early the next morning, awaiting trial, a loud trumpet blows that is heard all over the world, signaling the start of the Rapture. Later on, Sharon and Foster, after driving out into the desert, are both raptured to a purgatory-like landscape. Foster, who had been an atheist his whole life, accepts God into his heart and is allowed entrance to Heaven, but Sharon still refuses to renounce her anger at God for His cruelty. From above, Mary begs her to accept God back into her heart so she can join her and Randy in Heaven, but Sharon declines, preferring to remain alone in the purgatory-like landscape for eternity.
