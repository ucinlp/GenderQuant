H is about two heroin addicts, Michele, Pascale Montpetit and Snake, Martin Neufeld, who struggle to withdraw from the drug. They do it “cold turkey”. Snake nails the apartment door shut: they are determined to come clean. Michele awakens to discover she has been “betrayed” by her lover and is trapped. Barricaded in their apartment, they become each other’s hostage. As the days go by, their resolve ebbs and flows as they dig deeper and deeper into themselves. The hook to heroin addiction is the false sense of immunity to the state at large but as withdrawal starts, this cocooned existence abruptly unravels. Reality sharpens, intensifies, and re-awakens. Sensations flare, as Michele and Snake scrape at the walls, the camera becomes a monitor, never once leaving the apartment. When almost totally withdrawn, Snake discovers a forgotten stash. They are faced with the ultimate question: “Do we really have control over our addictions?”
