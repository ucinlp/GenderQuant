{{Review}} Circus has a tag line along with its sub title Nodi Maja Maadi. Dayaal, who spoke with emotional overtones in the film, said that he will be completing the film after sixty days of schedule. He said, nearly seventy percent of the shooting will be done near or on a train. I had to toil hard to get the required permission for the shoot. The story starts from Mysore station and ends in Bangalore station. director has taken permission from Railway authorities to shoot the film in Railway station and tracks in Mysore, Konkan Railway and Railway line stretching in Sakleshpura and Subramanya Ghat section.http://entertainment.oneindia.in/kannada/top-stories/2008/ganesh-archana-circus-070808.htmlCircus shot in train A joke gone bad, the story is about Dhanush  and his group of friends who live in the railway colony and their meeting point is the railway station. Dhanush is the leader of the gang and just to have some fun, they decide to send a letter stating on a particular date a train travelling from Mysore to Bangalore will be exploding. However, what they realize later after posting is that one of the friend's address is there on the letter. In a hurry, they get into the RMS bogie of the train and after a lot of twists finally manage to extract the letter from the pile. In this process, what Dhanush discovers is that the same day a real plot has been hatched by the terrorists to blow up the Gandhadagudi express so he decides to locate it and foil the plan. In the process of his journey, the friends take a break at one of the houses where Priya  and in no time, love blooms between Dhanush and her. So what happens to Gandhadagudi express? Is Dhanush successful in his attempts? All this forms the rest of the story.http://www.bharatstudent.com/cafebharat/movie_reviews_2-Kannada-Circus-Movie-Review-5,602.php
