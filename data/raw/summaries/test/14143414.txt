The struggle over the Bellamy estate ends with Michael Bellamy accused of murder and killed on the way to prison, while his brother, Abel Bellamy, takes control of the estate for his own nefarious plans. Bellamy is using Garr Castle as a base for his jewelry-theft ring, and he kidnaps his brother's wife to keep things quiet. Insurance investigator Spike Holland enters the case, and Bellamy continually dispatches his resident gang to do away with him. Detective Thompson, representing the law, is seldom of any help. Meanwhile, the estate's fabled "Green Archer", a masked, leotard-clad marksman, steals silently through Garr Castle and the estate grounds, confounding the enemy forces. This serial is an example of a fifteen-episode production that could have been rented for a twelve-episode run, as three episodes use an entirely self-contained subplot concerning the theft of a synthetic radium formula.  # Prison Bars Beckon # The Face at the Window # The Devil's Dictograph # Vanishing Jewels # The Fatal Spark # The Necklace of Treachery # The Secret Passage # Garr Castle is Robbed # Mirror of Treachery # The Dagger that Failed # The Flaming Arrow # The Devil Dogs # The Deceiving Microphone # End of Hope # The Green Archer Exposed{{Cite book}}
