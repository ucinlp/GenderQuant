The film starts off with Tyler  and little brother Logan  at the movie theater watching a brand new action film, that Tyler thinks was amazing, while Logan thinks it was bad and had no content. Then Logan tells Tyler about his plans to make a movie. Tyler says that he can make a movie. Then, while looking for actors, and crew workers, he faces rejection from his peers at school and his careless parents at home. Then Logan turns to the one he can always count on- Tyler. But when Tyler gets mad at Logan because of a misunderstanding about losing his jacket for his concert, Tyler tells Logan that the movie was a stupid idea, and that it was so bad he couldn't even finish reading it. He tells Logan, "you're only doing this for the attention anyway. It's not worth it. You're never gonna finish it, Logan". Then, while the parents are out and Tyler is at his band concert, Logan does what Tyler never thought he would- he tries to hang himself. Tyler comes up after getting angry at his orchestra leader, he looks all over the house trying to find Logan- and when he does, he is hanging from a tree in the backyard. Logan lives but if Tyler was two minutes late, he would have been brain dead. Although Tyler tries to get through the tragedy with the help of his friends, Ben  and Carlie , he just cannot. At the turn of the unexpected tragedy, the brothers' relationship is altered forever and Tyler is challenged to do whatever it takes to see his little brother's project succeed, even if that means risking it all.
