Movie star Laurel Stevens has made a new film. It's called The Kidnapped Bride and gives a brainstorm to a couple of small-time crooks, Mike and Dandy, to kidnap Laurel. While they take her to a Malibu beachfront hideout, agent Barney and studio chief Martin can't figure out why Laurel's a no-show at the premiere. Gossip columnist Daisy Parker is dying to know, too, so a decision is made to avoid a scandal at all costs and not report Laurel missing to the police. Mike and Dandy want a $50,000 ransom. Laurel is insulted, feeling she's worth 10 times that. Laurel also fears this thing could hurt her career by looking like a publicity stunt. So when Los Angeles police sergeant McBride, who once sent Mike to prison, comes to Malibu to do a routine check on him, Laurel alters her appearance and pretends to be Mike's girl. The studio finally goes to the cops and also offers a $100,000 reward. The ransom money is taken to the airport, which is where the not-too-bright Dandy has a job. McBride notices a portrait of Laurel at the studio and suddenly realizes where he's just seen her. Laurel has begun to fall for Mike for real. This time when McBride shows up, Laurel knocks him cold. She and Mike steal the cop's car and race to the airport. They get nabbed by the cops, but dim Dandy has picked up the wrong suitcase. There's no crime so there's no arrest, particularly since Laurel and Mike are now in love.
