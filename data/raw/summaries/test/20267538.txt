Cody Weever  grew up a child who loved films and yearned to make one with the help of his doting grandfather Alexander Weever , a former Hollywood star. His mother, an irascible self-made billionaire, refuses to fund Cody's project, leaving him resentful yet determined. At the same time, and much to his dismay, an unconfirmed rumor begins to spread in Cody's small affluent town of Buck Valley that the beautiful but untalented Hollywood star and salt fortune heiress Jasmine Danell  wants to star in Cody's film in order to make her current lover and famed French-Canadian director LeStat LeChaton , jealous. The residents of town react to the news by confronting Cody, and one by one lobbying to be a part of the film. His ego and ambition overpower Cody, and he allows the people of the town to distract and corrupt his initial vision. Jasmine stars in his film, and Cody's brother auctions the directorial role to LeChaton much to Cody's dismay. Finally, and after significant personal compromise, with his production usurped and his unprofessional cast and crew, Cody attempts to sabotage his set only to realize it has taken on a life of its own.
