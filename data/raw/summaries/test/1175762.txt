Bernie LaPlante is a pickpocket and petty criminal who anonymously rescues survivors of a plane crash, losing a shoe in the process. He later meets a homeless Vietnam veteran, John Bubber, and gives him his remaining shoe. The media cries out for the hero to come forward, and when Bernie can't due to incarceration, John uses the single shoe to take credit for the act. Bernie tries to tell people John is a fake, but the media has sensationalized the heroic Bubber, and everyone wants to believe in him rather than Bernie. TV reporter Gail Gayley, one of the crash survivors, considers herself to be in John's debt and soon grooms his public image. She finds herself falling in love with him even though she has questions about his authenticity, and he finds himself in an ethical dilemma since his lies are inspirational to countless people. Meanwhile, Bernie tries to bond with his son who is enamored with John. But he is trapped by his own character, unable to convince anyone of the truth. And he feels that if his son is going to idolize anyone, perhaps John is the better choice. Eventually the two men find themselves on the ledge of a building, where Bernie hatches a scheme to milk the media attention for all it's worth. Ultimately they agree that the world needs a hero, and John is the only one people will accept. Gail finally realizes the truth, John agrees to play the part, and Bernie stays out of the spotlight. Realizing that his son already idolizes him, Bernie decides to tell him the true story of the crash while at the zoo. After he tells him, a lady cries out that her daughter has fallen into the lion's cage. Bernie's son looks at him with expectant eyes, to which he sighs, slips off his shoes, and tells him to watch them.
