  In the town of Flåklypa , the inventor Reodor Felgen  lives with his animal friends Ludvig   and Solan  . Reodor works as a bicycle repairman, though he spends most of his time inventing weird Rube Goldberg-like contraptions. One day, the trio discover that one of Reodor's former assistants, Rudolf Blodstrupmoen , has stolen his design for a race car engine and has become a world champion Formula One driver. Solan secures funding from an Arab oil sheik who happens to be vacationing in Flåklypa, and to enter the race, the trio builds a gigantic racing car: Il Tempo Gigante—a fabulous construction with two extremely big engines , a body made out of copper, a spinning radar  and its own blood bank. Reodor ends up winning despite Blodstrupmoen's attempts at sabotage.
