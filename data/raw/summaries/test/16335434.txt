The film is about the life and death of Hussain, the youngest son of a Pakistani family. He meets a holy soothsayer who foretells his destiny, which is to liberate the poor and oppressed against a tyrannical government. The struggle parallels that of Imam Hussain of the 7th century who was martyred by Yazid I, the Umayyad Caliph.
