Somewhere in Beverly Hills, in the house of Jack Benny , a mouse version of Jack is practicing his violin---off key---and saying to himself, "Who is this guy Isaac Stern?"  Outside Jack's mouse hole, a cat is lying in wait, wearing ear muffs to filter out the discordant sound of Jack's violin. Jack calls his servant, Rochester  to get his white suit, which Rochester is wearing at the time. Jack tells the valet that his rental period is up  and he needs the suit because he is taking Mary Livingstone out for her birthday, and, true to character, is looking for a good cheap restaurant. While waiting for Mary, Jack decides to count his cheese in a basement vault. Using a coin on a string, he opens the lock, which appears to be a coin-operated lock from a pay toilet. As soon as he walks through the door, he takes a cane from a nail on the wall and starts humming We're in the Money. When he reaches the bottom of the stairs, he reaches through a hole and trips a razor blade hanging above the passageway like a guillotine. He then comes up to a derringer and uses the cane to trip the trigger on the derringer. Finally, he comes up to another hole, reaches through with the cane and trips a mousetrap. He then reaches the vault door, opens a combination lock, pulls the door open and numerous sound effects including various alarms, a foghorn and machine gun noises are heard. Ed, the vault guard, asks "who goes there?", and then an exchange is heard where Ed, apparently having been in the vault for a long time, asks "did we win the war yet?" When Benny assures Ed that the war had been won, thinking that Ed was referring to World War II, Ed says: "That's good. What do you think we'll do with the Kaiser?" Mary arrives while Jack is inspecting his cheese vault, and he emerges wondering who has been pilfering his gorgonzola. A fat rodent version of Don Wilson attempts to deliver a commercial when Jack advises him that this is a movie and not a television program. When Mary suggests a place, Jack's eyes ring up like an old cash register with a dollar sign  and "no sale", they discuss other options. As they were discussing the options, the cat writes a message extolling the "Kit Kat Club"  and sends it to Jack as a paper airplane. Jack and Mary putter off in his Maxwell with Rochester behind the wheel until they reach the Kit Kat Club by following the arrows pointing to it. While enroute, Mary asks for champagne, while Jack says that he prefers a good "mousecatel". Unbeknownst to them, the "club" is actually the maw of a real cat, and as they enter, the cat's mouth closes on them. Jack cries: "Help! Help!" as the camera cuts to the live-action Jack Benny, who wakes up and, breaking the fourth wall, tells the audience: "Gosh, what a crazy dream! Imagine- Mary and me as two little mice trapped inside a cat's mouth! And me playing the violin!" At that point, Jack is interrupted by the sound of a discordant "Rock-a-Bye Baby" played on the violin, coming from within Jack's live-action cat. From there, the rodent versions of Jack and Mary emerge unharmed from the live-action cat. Following one last bit of animation , the real Jack Benny does one of his famous "takes" as the cartoon fades out.
