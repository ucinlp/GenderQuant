Daffy scoffs at a flock of ducks flying south as he decides to hitchhike his way south. Not having any luck so far, Daffy paints what appears to be an excavation hole in the road. Porky arrives in his red sports car and stops in front of the "hole". Daffy is delighted that Porky is driving to Miami. He gathers his luggage and finally manages to stuff it in the trunk. Porky and Daffy are driving along the road when a tiny yellow car starts sounding its horn and tailgating their car. Daffy jerks the steering wheel and car, not letting the small car pass until Daffy slams on the brakes and the tiny car collides with their rear bumper. Daffy challenges the driver, who reveals himself as a giant of a man, prompting Daffy to behave like a friendly dog. The man ignores Daffy and pummels Porky with a pile driver punch that sends Porky's head through the radiator cap of his car. Porky and Daffy continue driving. Daffy wants to drive faster and forces Porky's foot down the accelerator pedal despite Porky's protests. Immediately, a cop on a motorcycle pursues and catches up with them. After a prank from Daffy leading the cop to being flung by the luggage in the trunk, they brought to the police station. Daffy is waiting outside the police station in the next town when Porky comes out, happy that he was fined only $2. Daffy, outraged, pushes his luck and leads Porky to an additional fine $50. Porky angered by Daffy's incessant antics plots revenge. Porky buys and gives Daffy a gift, but tells him not open it as he quickly puts it in the trunk. Daffy, not being able to stand the suspense, opens the trunk, making his luggage fly out and launch Daffy away. Porky snickers evilly and speeds off. Daffy opens his gift and finds that it is an Acme Hitchhiker's Thumb, which he vainly tries to use all winter for a ride.
