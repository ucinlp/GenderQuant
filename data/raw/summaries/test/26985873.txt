Lola Montrose  is a kept woman. The man she lives with while facing the scorn of society, famous surgeon Dr. John Hampton , supports her in lavish style. She wishes he will marry her. Having tired of his mistress, however, Hampton tells her that he plans to marry a "good woman," Paula Chester , who was originally intended for his son, Irwin . He is sure she will exert proper influence over Irwin. Lola begs Hampton, whom she loves, to marry her instead. She tells him of her son, David , who she sent away to school. But Hampton insists that he must not spoil his son's future. In revenge, Lola decides to marry Irwin. Getting the young man intoxicated, she gets him to propose and they go to the minister. Because Irwin is drunk, however, the clergyman refuses to perform the marriage ceremony. As he was so drunk, Irwin does not realize that there was no actual wedding. He brings Lola home and introduces her to his father as his wife. Hampton, naturally, denounces her. Lola then receives a call that her son, David, has been badly injured by a fall at school. His new wife, Paula, goes to Hampton and convinces him to operate on David, which saves the boys life. In gratitude, Lola relents. Admitting that the marriage was a hoax, she lets go of Irwin. Seeing his error, Hampton agrees to take care of her and her son.
