It's the story of a fastidious king Balbir Singh  of Himmatpur whose stern, high handed behaviour leads to a breakdown in communication with his four children; eldest daughter Hemalata , younger daughter Ashalata  and sons Pratap  and Rajendra . His intimidating commands lead to a partial paralysis of Hemlata's lower limbs as also a simmering discontent amongst other descendants. After numerous attempts fail to cure Hemalata, the king hires a new doctor Sanjay  who, contrary to expectations, is not just young and handsome but also against silly protocols that hamper laughter, fun and frolic. Dr. Sanjay's experimentations provide greater mobility and joy to youngsters, giving them fresh lease of life and a much needed voice of rebellion. Transcending normal barriers of doctor-client confidentiality, Sanjay and Hemalata fall in love and the romance enables her to walk in double quick time on her feet! Initially reluctant, the king awakens to a new dawn of freedom and humbly accepts not just their relationship but also Ashalata's betrothal to social activist , who defeats him in a general election.
