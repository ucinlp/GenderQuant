This is a series of three stories revolving around women. The first story is about a young woman who works in a Tokyo nightclub. She has what seems like a good plan for a strong financial future; she is investing in a company on the one hand, and on the other, taking action to snare the son of the company's owner in marriage. In the second story, a young woman is employed by a real estate agent in order to convince male clients to invest in worthless property, usually by bathing with them. The last story is about a widowed geisha who has no financial worries. But when she falls in love with a forger, she opts to wait for him after he is sent to prison. This causes trouble for her in family and society, but she ignores them despite the pressure.
