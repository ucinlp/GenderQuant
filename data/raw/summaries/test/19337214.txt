When his wife dies, Manny Singer  searches for a housekeeper/nanny to take care of his young daughter, Molly. After several unsuccessful interviews that turn up such prospects as a religious zealot, a Sophia Loren wannabe, and a closet alcoholic  who tries to seduce him, Corrina  interviews for the position. He perceives her as overqualified because of her college degree and, initially, decides not to hire her. However, as she is leaving, he sees the way she interacts with Molly. Since her mother's death, she has not only refused to speak but doesn't even acknowledge people. She responds to Corrina and Manny hires the no-nonsense housekeeper. Very quickly a strong bond is formed between nanny and child and soon Molly regains her desire to speak. Corrina and Manny fall in love and, in 1950s America, face difficulties as an interracial couple. Her sister wants her to date a black man, and his mother and best friend push him to date a perky white woman with two children. Love triumphs despite these barriers.
