In Guatemala, two reckless fortune-hunting pilots bribe officials in order to fly a load of coffee beans from South America into the United States. To increase their profits, they take aboard three passengers whom they agree to smuggle into the U.S. Problems arise when sacks of the beans containing deadly tarantulas are loaded into the cargo bay. During the flight, the poisonous arachnids irritated by the plane’s vibration and high altitude escape from the sacks during a fierce thunderstorm. As the plane wobbles under the torrential rains, the sacks split open spilling the beans and the noxious spiders. The three illegal immigrants, also in the hold are trapped in the cargo hold with the spiders. They vainly attempt to hold off the spiders with their shoes or whatever swat-material they can fine. The lethal spiders eventually overcome all three. Meanwhile in the cockpit, the pilots work to overcome a developing mechanical problem that endangers the aircraft. They realize they must make an emergency landing as they pass over the orange-producing town of Finleyville, California. Unbeknownst to the pilots, the arachnids have escaped and have begun to swarm the cockpit, attacking the pilots. The plane crash-lands near Finleyville. The city’s emergency response system moves to aid the downed aircraft and pilots. A fire breaks out at the crash site and the deadly tarantulas scurry from the location toward a nearby orange grove. The fire is brought under control and the pilots and passengers are pulled from the airplane. Those not killed begin to exhibit strange symptoms. The town’s physician, Dr. Hodgins , is baffled until a local citizen who has been bitten, sudden drops to the ground. Cindy Beck  and her brother Matthew  investigate the site but fail to see the spiders. Cindy’s husband  aids with the investigation. A family of aviators, the Beck family attempts to solve the puzzle of why the plane crashed. In the meantime, the tarantulas continue their attacks, and more people are brought into Dr. Hodgins’ clinic. The doctor finally figures it out, but by this time, the spiders have spread out. The city’s mayor is fearful that any news of the problem infesting the city’s oranges will bring the township financial ruin. Bert Springer , one of the city’s responsible citizens, helps the Beck family investigate. Cindy’s son is bitten and incapacitated by the spider. Knowing the problem, the doctor saves the boy. Bert organizes the town citizens, and they risk their lives trying to save the town as the food-seeking spiders converge on the orange packaging plant. The plan to get rid of the spiders involves exposing the deadly arachnids to the buzzing sounds of their enemy: bees. Using a recording of bees buzzing, the tarantulas are rendered motionless with the bee sounds. This allows everyone to collect the spiders in jars. During the process, the electrical system switches off, and Cindy finds herself suddenly surrounded by the deadly spiders. At the last minute, the electricity is switched back on, Cindy is saved, and the remainder of spiders are eliminated.
