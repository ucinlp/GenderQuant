In the year 2013 in Bangkok, the Liberal Party leader Direk Damrongprapa  campaigns during an election on an anti-corruption platform with the support of his fiancee Vasana Tienpradap , a Harvard educated geology expert. Three years later Vasana separates herself from Direk who has become the prime minister over his betrayal in refusing to stop construction of the Chumporn nuclear power plant. Meanwhile, a masked vigilante known as Red Eagle  emerges within the city. Red Eagle is actually Rom Rittikrai, a former Special Task Force agent who had been rescued by Vasana when escaping from an attack by the Matulee  and got a bullet in the brain; his terrible headaches can only be relieved by regular doses of morphine. Red Eagles has dispatched drug-dealers while Detective Chart Wuttikrai  and his Sikh colleague Singh  are ordered to track down Red Eagle. Red Eagle kills the parliamentary member Sonkuan who is a child pornographer. This leads him to become the no. 1 target of the Matuleee. Vasana recognises that Red Eagle and Rome are the same man, igniting an attraction between them. Meanwhile, Chart and the Matalee continue to hunt Red Eagle down.<ref namehttp://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/the-red-eagle|workThe Red Eagle |authorOctober 29, 2010|date=October 29, 2010}}
