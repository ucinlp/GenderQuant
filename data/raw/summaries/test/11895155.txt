Several friends  decide to spend their vacation by fishing. Taking with themselves a large helping of vodka, they sail off, but quickly find themselves without much understanding as to their present location. Finally reaching some shore, which they mistakenly believe is still Russia, but which in reality happens to be neighboring Finland, they get off the ship and spend some time on the shore, eventually falling asleep. Not without the effect of previously consumed alcohol, the friends manage to forget their supplies of vodka as they sail off the shore. The quantity of forgotten goods being sizable , they now face the challenging task of getting back their belongings, which now happen to reside across the border in a different country.
