George Moran is a former American paratrooper and veteran of the Dominican Republic intervention who now runs a small beachfront motel in Miami. While searching for a Dominican woman named Luci Palma who saved his life in 1965 , he begins a relationship with Mary DeBoya, the wealthy, unhappy wife of a former Dominican general who continues to use sadistic methods to get what he wants. Moran gets involved in a plot by his fellow military veteran Nolen Tyner and a former New York policeman, Jiggs Scully, to rip off the general. Moran must elude a number of double-crosses as he and Mary attempt to gain her freedom plus $2 million of the general's money. The film was shot in Santo Domingo and Florida.
