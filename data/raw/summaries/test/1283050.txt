Retail clerk Dante Hicks  opens the Quick Stop convenience store to find that it is on fire; Randal  had left the coffee pot on after closing the night before. As a result of the Quick Stop's destruction, Dante and Randal begin working at a Mooby's fast food restaurant. A year later, Dante is planning to leave his minimum wage lifestyle in favor of a family life in Florida with his fianc√©e Emma Bunting , whose father will provide them with a home and a business to run. This leaves Randal bitterly disappointed, who fears that with Dante moving to Florida would leave him without his best friend. Jay and Silent Bob  have since followed Dante and Randal, and now loiter outside of Mooby's. Jay and Silent Bob no longer do drugs after they were arrested for the possession of drugs and were sent to rehab, and become devout Christians following their release. However, Jay and Silent Bob continue selling drugs. Throughout the day, many misadventures occur within Mooby's; among these incidents are arguments between Randal and Dante, as well as arguments between Randal and Elias , another Mooby's employee, and with a customer  who is a fan of The Lord of the Rings. Other incidents include Randal and Dante unintentionally giving Jay and Silent Bob inedible food, and Randal using a racial slur in front of a couple of black customers, although Randal did not directly insult them nor did he know the term "porchmonkey" which he used was actually a racial slur. The word nearly gets Randal fired. Another incident occurs when a former fellow high school student, Lance Dowds ([[Jason Lee , taunts Dante and Randal for their jobs, prompting Randal to ease his anger through going go-karting with Dante, despite leaving work without asking permission from their boss Becky Scott , leaving her and Elias to deal with customers on their own. Dante confesses to Becky that he is worried about dancing at his wedding, so she takes him up onto the roof of the restaurant to teach him some moves. Dante soon lets go of his inhibitions and learns how to dance. When the song ends, Dante, caught up in the moment, tells Becky he loves her, and she reveals to him that she is pregnant; Dante and Becky had a one night stand on the prep table a few weeks before. Becky tells Dante not to tell anyone about the baby; however Dante tells Randal, who is shocked and criticizes Dante for cheating on his fiancee. An angered Becky leaves when she learns that Dante told Randal. Randal encourages Dante to leave Mooby's in search for Becky, and in the meantime, sets up a surprise going away party for Dante. Randal hires "Kinky Kelly and the Sexy Stud," a donkey show with a fog machine. When Dante comes back, he mistakes the fog for a fire and calls the fire department, but upon discovering that it is not a fire, he proceeds to watch the show with Randal, Jay, Bob, and Elias. The group soon discovers that "Kinky Kelly" is, in fact, the donkey, while the guy , whom Randal thought to be the pimp, is "The Sexy Stud". When Becky returns, Dante tells her that he believes that she feels the same way about him as he does about her. As they kiss, Emma arrives. She throws her engagement ring at Becky and angrily storms off. The fire and police departments soon arrive and discover the show. Dante, Randal, Elias, Jay, Silent Bob, and The Sexy Stud are detained and jailed. The Sexy Stud tells the others that they will soon be released, and that he will have to pay a fine for his acts. Nevertheless, Dante blames Randal for ruining his life and expresses his eagerness to start a new life without Randal, while Randal condemns Dante for wanting to move to Florida and even goes as far as calling Dante a "fucking drone", for Randal's view that Dante wants to live his life under the standards of others. Amid the argument, Randal proposes that they buy the Quick Stop and re-open it, although Dante reacts by saying that neither two have the money to purchase the store. Jay and Silent Bob, who were watching the confrontation between Dante and Randal, offer to lend them some money  on the condition that they can loiter outside of the Quick Stop. Randal accepts their offer, but Dante remains somewhat skeptical, prompting Randal to emotionally confess his fear of losing Dante. As a result, Dante agrees to the proposition as well, and after his release, he proposes to Becky, who accepts. Elias applies for a job and is hired at RST Video, the store adjacent to Quick Stop. In the very last scene, with the store open, Dante says, "Can you feel it? Today is the first day of the rest of our lives," as the screen turns to black and white, resembling the first movie.
