Shekhar lives a poor lifestyle along with his maternal uncle, Dharamdas; his aunt; a cousin, Sita - who is separated from her husband, Mahesh; and also has a sister, Gauri, who had eloped with her lover and everyone believes is dead. He studies in college along with wealthy fellow collegian, Bela. Both do not get along, but that changes when her dad comes to know about Shekhar's good character and thinks that he will be a suitable son-in-law. He approaches Dharamdas and arranges their marriage with the condition that Shekhar move in with his family, to which Dharamdas and Shekhar agree but Bela's mom is displeased as she would like her daughter to marry Rajan Murari, the son of their employee, Govindram. Despite of this, the marriage does take place and Shekhar moves in, is employed by Thakur, and the family settles down to a fairly harmonious relationship. Their idyllic lifestyle is shattered when Bela suspects, and then across evidence that Sita and Mahesh, who are now together, have stolen her diamond necklace; that Shekhar is having an affair with a dancing girl; that he has embezzled Rs.10,000/- and had gone to an undisclosed location for 3 days. Things get even worse when Thakur meets with an accident, and subsequently passes away - paving the way for his wife to arrange her daughter's divorce and Shekhar's death.
