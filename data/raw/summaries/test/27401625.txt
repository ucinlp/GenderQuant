The year is 2050 and alien space travelers look down on Planet Earth and witness the terrible devastation that it has suffered from climate change and environmental destruction at the hands of its most dominant species—humans. Incomprehension sweeps throughout the alien ship and into their alien thoughts, as they ask 'how can such an intelligent and creative species treat their own planet like this?' They return to the present day to warn young people about the society that awaits them if positive action is not taken. Time is running out—it's not too late.
