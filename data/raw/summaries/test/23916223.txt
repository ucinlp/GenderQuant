In the near future, a new law sends criminals to a virtual reality prison built by a shadowy corporation called Zircon based in Seattle. Steven Falcon, the designer of the system, realizes the dangers of it being overloaded and of hackers who try to break in and steal files only to have the prisoners try to break out via that method. When Falcon threatens to quit the operation he becomes marked for murder by his employers who force him to enter the Maxtrix virtual reality/afterlife to find the source of the danger of the system crashing.
