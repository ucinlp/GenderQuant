The couple was taken by surprise when a Russian army soldier came over and asked for a stay. All soldiers, if they were not cossacks and, of course, did not speak Ukrainian, in Ukraine were called moskali  hence the name of the movie. The young lady tries to cover up her out-of-marriage relationship and let the soldier to stay for rest. When Mykhailo arrives soon thereafter she hides the clerk. Moskal knew that something is going on between Tetyana and Fintyk yet he finds a common ground with his hostess. They agreed to get rid of the clerk yet not to spoil her marriage. Then there are few scenes that reflect the peculiar inter-ethnic relationship between Ukrainians and Russians in face of the soldier.

In the last scene everybody explains to Mykhailo what have really happened and why. The husband gets really mad and has an intent to kill everybody, but moskal steps in just in time to defuse the situation.
