 On Easter morning, the Easter Bunny leaves an Easter egg for Tom and Jerry. However, the egg is not a chocolate egg; instead, out hatches a duckling named Quacker, who insists on swimming in everything in the house: Tom's milk dish, the fish tank , the watercooler, the bathtub, and the kitchen sink. Tom and Jerry put Quacker back in his egg and tape the egg shut, but Quacker escapes. The last straw occurs when Quacker is swimming in the shower cubicle and floods the house. Tom and Jerry conspire to drop Quacker off at a nearby public park, but their plan backfires when Quacker returns, this time along with more ducklings, flooding the entire house with water. Quacker tells them that he and the other ducks have a surprise for them and says, "All together, fellas!" and the ducks all shout at once in unison to Tom and Jerry, "HAPPY EASTER!" and swim around them in the end, while Tom and Jerry smile.
