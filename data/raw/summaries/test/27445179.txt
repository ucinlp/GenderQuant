It is summer in Sweden, and the Andersson family has decided to go on vacation to Greece. The trip turns out to be too expensive, especially when Håkan destroys a shelf in the travel agency. Rudolf decides that they should go on a caravan holiday instead. When they start the journey, Karin runs over Rudolph's foot with the caravan and they have to go into a hospital. There, Rudolph gets his foot bandaged by Lenny, a medic who is pretending to be a doctor. At the hospital Sune meets a girl named Cornelia and falls in love with her, but he makes a fool of himself at a candy vending machine. The next day they arrive at the "Jonsson camp" where they should stay. At the camp, Annas meet the greaser Leffe and they immediately become fond of each other, Leffe subsequently runs over Håkan with his quad bike. It turns out that the family is living next door to Lenny, and Cornelia his daughter. Sune tries out a way to win Cornelia's heart, giving her a pair of earrings that he believes are in a toy machine at the camp site. Therefore, he begins to raise money by returning bottles, but all he gets is a bunch of phantom rings. Eventually he gets the earrings from one of the camp owners. Before it is time for the family to go home, they are invited to a farewell party by Lenny's family. During the party Lenny's brother Kenny, who is a real doctor, arrives. He looks at Rudolph's foot, which proves to be restored. The film ends with Sune and Cornelia meeting on the beach at dusk, where she gets the earrings.
