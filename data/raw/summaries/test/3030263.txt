When a Senator is killed in an explosion, the FBI investigates. The agent in charge is Danny O'Neill , who is separated from his wife Terry  and behaving very erratic. Initially the investigation does not reveal what kind of explosive or even what was used to detonate it. Eventually it is learned that terrorists have developed an "invisible" liquid explosive which is activated within the human body. And it does not help that they have to report to Senator Traveres , the man whom O'Neill's wife is having an affair with and whom Danny also assaulted. Later, another senator is killed while riding in a limousine, and limo driven by one of the conspirators. This villain is subsequently struck by a moving car, and is taken into custody, and brought into court. Since this villain is now considered a risk by his peers, the judge in the case is slipped the potion, and she spontaneously explodes, killing the arraigned villain in the process. It is at this time that O'Neill discovers the cause of the explosions, the chemically enhanced water in the judges pitcher. It becomes obvious that the next target is Senator Traveres, so O'Neill, concerned that his wife may become collateral damage, trails his every move. He eventually infiltrates the senators heavily guarded mansion, at a very convenient time, as the senators mansion is being overrun by bad guys. O'Neill concocts a cornucopia of interesting homemade weapons, even building bombs using fertilizer found in the kitchen cabinet. All the bad guys die, except for the main one , who holds the wife of O'Neill hostage in front of O'Neill and Traveres. The bad guy swallows some of the liquid, conceding his fate, but intending to bring them all with him. However, O'Neill manages to free his wife and send her to safe ground. O'Neill and Traveres, however, do not have it so nice. They are forced to jump from the third floor by the explosion emanating from the bad guy. Traveres lands on a wrought-iron fence, which impales and kills him. O'Neill is seen dangling by his arm from Traveres, raising the question of how did his arm not completely rip out of the socket. The ending features the hero , bagging the ultimate prize , and living happily ever after.
