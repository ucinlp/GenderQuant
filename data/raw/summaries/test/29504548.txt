Two ex-Marines, Jimmy McGinnis  and Harry Curtis  who haven't seen each other for fifteen years meet at a racetrack. They both immediately drop their jobs of an attendant and cleaner to rekindle their friendship and brawl over which one will have Violet  for their girl. When visiting a clip joint called the Shoreleave Cafe with Violet, they meet the owner, Jim Blake ([[Paul Kelly . Blake was a former Captain of theirs who left the Corps under a cloud when he was blamed for a security breach. Blake is involved in espionage where he is arranging to buy the plans for a new amphibious vehicle. Jimmy and Harry are called back to active service as Gunnery Sergeants with the 6th Marines where they crash the spy ring. The fast paced Hellzapoppin' type comedy uses the spy plot as merely an excuse for five musical numbers by Harry Revel and a variety of comedy sequences such as barroom brawls over thrown garters, spies and policemen with speech impediments, and jeep, motorcycle and car chases.
