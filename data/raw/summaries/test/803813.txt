The story is set in Hope, England. It's Christmastime, and 'tis the season to put on Shakespeare's most cheery seasonal play: Hamlet. Joe Harper takes the project on as a Final Stand of sorts under the encouragement of his catty agent, advertising in the local newspaper for actors at a low price. From the rabble of actors both strange and untalented, he chooses the following: Hamlet: Joe Harper himself. Ophelia: Nina Raymond, a shortsighted well-meaning space cadet who has been using low-calorie mayonnaise for lotion because she can't make out the label. King Claudius: Henry Wakefield, a long-suffering and cynical old Englishman with a sharp tongue and a list of prejudices five miles  long, forced to room with Queen Gertrude's player. Queen Gertrude: Terry DuBois, a flamboyantly gay theatrical actor with a preoccupation for costume and an estranged son. Laertes, Fortinbras, and various: Tom Newman, an uptight, self-righteous character who foists his values on everyone else and attempts to distinguish his many characters with a variety of outrageous accents. Horatio, Bernardo: Not-so-subtle Carnforth Greville, an alcoholic in denial and a kindly bachelor with no memory for lines whatsoever. Polonius, Marcellus, and the First Gravedigger: Vernon Spatch, the ambitious techie's techie, self-imposed marketing director, and unofficial documentarian of the proceedings. Set Designer: Fadge, just Fadge, specializing in new-age art and obscure statements about "air," "space," and "fog." Close friends call her "Fa".
