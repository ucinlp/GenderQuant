Waking up on a New York park bench, a man's mind is a total blank. He has no identification on him, just a slip of paper in his pocket with a phone number on it. The number leads him to a woman, Gloria, who doesn't recognize the man but gives him some money out of pity. For the purpose of identifying himself, he invents a name out of thin air, spotting a Budweiser beer truck go by just as a jet plane passes overhead. On the street, Buddwing spots a woman he thinks he knows and calls out "Grace!" to her. Her name is Janet, but a flashback of a romance with her from college days goes through Buddwing's mind. He experiences similar flashbacks after meeting Fiddle Corwin, an actress. They share a romantic fling, but images of her contemplating suicide flash through his mind. The Blonde, a socialite, is on a scavenger hunt, just for kicks. Buddwing accompanies her to Harlem, where her goal is to get into a dice game. While there, a passing remark jogs Buddwing's memory. He recovers from the shock of an incident involving his wife and a pregnancy, ultimately remembering who and where he was before his blackout.
