Being turned down by the local magistrate , he spends the night in a nearby castle owned by Dr. Nox , an old friend of his father, along with Mrs. Simpson , an American multimillionaire who desires the property. After waking up in the night, Philipe finds a note in his pocket saying ‘Give up your search, otherwise bad luck awaits you! – The Vampires’ and a mysterious passage behind a painting in his room. Meanwhile, Mrs. Simpson’s money and jewels are stolen in her sleep by a masked thief, but Philipe is suspected of the crime. Philipe again visits the magistrate, who now believes his case, and they trick Dr. Nox and Mrs. Simpson into waiting in an anteroom. At the castle, Philipe and the magistrate find the head of Inspector Durtal hidden in the passage in Philipe’s room. Back in the anteroom, they find that Mrs. Simpson is dead and that Dr. Nox has vanished. Her pocket contains a note from the Grand Vampire saying that he has murdered the real Dr. Nox and is now assuming his identity.  Grand Vampire in disguise as Count de Noirmoutier, reads that ballerina Marfa Koutiloff , who is engaged to Philipe, will perform a ballet called The Vampires. To prevent her from publicizing the Vampires' activities and to deter Philipe, he gives Marfa a poisoned ring before her performance, which kills her onstage. Amidst the panicking crowds Philipe recognizes the Grand Vampire and follows him to an abandoned fort and is captured by the gang. They agree to interrogate Philipe at midnight and execute him at dawn. Philipe finds that the Vampire guarding him is one of his co-workers, Oscar-Cloud Mazamette . They decide to work together and capture the Grand Inquisitor when he arrives at midnight. At dawn the police raid the lair and kill the Grand Inquisitor, who turns out to be the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, while the other Vampires escape.   While faking illness to get off work, Philipe tries to decode a red booklet that he lifted from the Grand Inquisitor’s body, which contains the crimes of the Vampires. He discovers that his house is under surveillance by the Vampires, so he leaves in disguise. Following clues in the booklet he arrives at "The Howling Cat" night club. Performing there is Irma Vep , whose name Philipe sees is an anagram for vampire. After her act, the Grand Vampire assigns Irma to retrieve the red booklet. As Philipe returns home Mazamette arrives, along with a poison pen he stole from the Grand Vampire. A few days later, Irma arrives at their house disguised as a new maid, but Philipe recognizes her. She tries to poison him, but fails. His mother  leaves to meet her brother after receiving word that he has been in a car accident, but it turns out to be a trap and she is captured by the Vampires. While Philipe is asleep, Irma lets another Vampire into his home but he shoots them. They escape, however, because his gun was loaded with blanks. In a shack in the slums, Philipe’s mother is held by Father Silence , a deaf-mute, and is forced to sign a ransom note, but she kills him with Mazamette’s poison pen and escapes.   The Grand Vampire, under the alias of a real estate broker, meets Juan-José Moréno , a businessman, who asks for an apartment with a safe. Moréno makes a purchase, but the safe is rigged and is opened from the other side by Irma and the Grand Vampire. However, the case Moréno places inside contains the Vampires’ black attire. Later, in disguise as bank secretary, Irma learns that a man called Mr. Metadier has to bring ₣300,000 to another branch. In the case that he is unable to make the delivery, Irma will. Soon afterward, Mr. Metadier is murdered by the Vampires and his body disposed of while on a train home from a film. When Irma is about to take the money for him a spectre of Mr. Metadier appears and takes it instead. The Grand Vampire the spectre, who escapes down a manhole. Later that day, Mme. Metadier appears at the bank, saying she hasn’t seen her husband in days. They also find out that the money hasn’t been delivered. Philipe soon learns of this, and goes to the bank in disguise, recognizing Irma. He finds her address and a few hours later sneaks in, using Mazamette as a ploy. Irma and the Grand Vampire open the safe from their side, only to find Metadier’s body and the money. Philipe tries to attack them but is knocked down and they escape. Philipe calls the police just as Moréno enters and finds his safe opened from the other side. He walks through, being caught by Philipe. Moréno is revealed to be another criminal in disguise, and claims not to have killed Metadier, but to have found his body by the train tracks where the Vampires had dumped it and put it in his safe, assuming his identity and taking the money, which is now in the Vampires' possession. The police arrive and arrest Moréno.   The examining magistrate from Saint-Clement-Sur-Cher relocates to Paris and is assigned to the Vampire case and the Moréno affair. After being summoned to the magistrate, Moréno commits suicide using a concealed cyanide capsule. His body is left in his cell, but during the night he wakes up, very much alive. He kills the night-watchman and takes his clothes, escaping from the prison. He is noticed by Mazamette, who is suffering from insomnia. The following morning, Moréno is found to have escaped. While writing an account of the events, Philipe is pulled out of his window by the Vampires and whisked into a large box. He is driven away but is taken off and slides down a large flight of stairs. The Vampires retreat and Philipe is let out by two bystanders. He visits the costume designer whose name is on the box, at the same time as Moréno and his gang who are buying police uniforms for a scheme. Philipe learns that the box was to go to Baron de Mortesalgues on Maillot Avenue. Later, Moréno confronts Philipe in a café, but when he calls for the nearby policemen, they turn out to be part of Moréno’s gang and he is again captured. Meanwhile, Mazamette breaks into Moréno’s hideout. Philipe is taken there to be hanged by the gang, unless he can give them means to revenge themselves against the Vampires. He tells them that Baron de Mortesalgues is the Grand Vampire, and they spare him, tying him up. Mazamette appears and frees him. That evening, the Grand Vampire holds a party, in disguise as Baron de Mortesalgues, for his niece, Irma in disguise, which attracts many members of the Parisian aristocracy. He reveals that at midnight there will be a surprise, the surprise being a gas attack on the guests. The Vampires steal all of their valuables while they are unconscious. They flee with the stolen items on the top of their car, but Moréno, forewarned by Philipe, takes them for himself. Mazamette visits Philipe, angry with their lack of progress and tries to quit. Philipe shows him a line from a book of Jean de la Fontaine’s Fables which states “in all things, one must take the end into account.”   Fifteen days have passed since the events at Maillot. Moréno, who has established a gaze with a terrible hypnotic power, is looking for clues to lead him to the Vampires, and reads in a paper that a Fontainebleau notary has been murdered by them. Meanwhile, Philipe and Mazamette go to see a film, which mysteriously contains Irma Vep and the Grand Vampire. While cycling to Fontainebleau, they spot an American tourist, Horatio Werner, riding into the forest, and follow him. He places a box under one of the boulders, and they take it. The Grand Vampire, who is staying in the Royal Hunt Hotel under the pseudonym of Count Kerlor, along with Irma in disguise as his son, Viscount Guy, reads in a paper that George Baldwin , an American millionaire, has been robbed of $200,000 and who ever can capture the criminal, Raphael Norton, will be awarded the money. He notices that Mr and Mrs. Werner, who are staying at the hotel, are distressed by this, and concludes that Mr. Werner is Raphael Norton. Philipe and Mazamette arrive at the hotel and find that the Vampires are based there. In a different hotel they force open the box and find Baldwin’s stolen money inside. Moréno comes to the Royal Hunt in disguise. While the Grand Vampire tells the hotel guests a story, Irma breaks into the Werner’s suite, finding a map leading to the box in the forest. When she leaves, she is strangled and hypnotised by Moréno, who takes the map. While his gang take Irma away, he dresses his hypnotised maid, Laura, as Irma and tells her to give the Vampires the map. Once one of the Vampires  follows the map to get the treasure, Moréno’s gang ambushes her, only to find that Philipe has already taken it. In the early morning, the police raid the hotel and find that Werner is actually Norton, so Philipe and Mazamette win the money. Moréno is shown to have fallen in love with Irma and no longer intends to hold her ransom to the Grand Vampire. The Grand Vampire comes to meet Moréno, but Moréno convinces Irma to kill him.   A mysterious man  arrives at Moréno’s home, and shows that he knows that the Grand Vampire’s body is inside a trunk. Moréno tries to get rid of him, but he is paralysed by a pin in the man’s glove. The man reveals himself to be the true Grand Vampire, Satanus, and that the first was a subordinate. While at a cabaret called the "Happy Shack", Moréno and Irma receive a note from Satanus saying they will see proof of his power at two o'clock. At two he fires a powerful canon at the "Happy Shack", largely destroying it. Meanwhile, Philipe decides to visit Mazamette, but he is out "chasing the girls." He hides as Mazamette arrives home, drunk, with two women and a friend, who he later chases out angrily at gunpoint. The next morning, Irma and Moréno go to Satanus’ home to surrender, and Satanus offers them the chance to work with him, showing them that George Baldwin is stopping at the park hotel. One of Moréno’s accomplices, Lily Flower , goes to the Park Hotel and poses as an interviewer from "Modern Woman" magazine and gets his autograph. Afterwards, Irma enters and records his voice saying "Parisian women are the most charming I've seen, all right!" Back at Moréno’s home, they write out an order to pay Lily Flower $100,000, ending it with Baldwin’s autograph. When the banker calls Baldwin to confirm the cheque, Irma intercepts the call, disguised as a telephone operator, and plays the recording she made instead. While Lily Flower is taking the money, Mazamette comes in, recognising her as a squeeze from the "Happy Shack", and follows her, seeing her give Moréno the money in a taxi. Moréno gives Satanus the money, but he is given it back as a present. Philipe and Mazamette capture Lily Flower at her home and tell her to call Moréno and tell him to come, but when he and Irma arrive they fall into a trap and are caught by the police.   Irma, sentenced to life imprisonment, has been sent to St. Lazarus’ prison. A transfer order is sent to the prison to send Irma to a penal colony in Algeria. On the day of her departure, Irma finds out that Moréno has been executed. Satanus follows Irma’s transportation route, stopping at a seaside hotel in disguise as a Priest. At the port, he gives some religious comfort to the prisoners, but Irma’s copy contains a secret message saying “the ship will blow up.” Satanus destroys the ship with a canon in an unfathomable explosion. Meanwhile, Philipe finds through the red codebook that the explosive shell that landed on the “Happy Shack”, and also now the boat came from Montmartre, and Mazamette goes to find it. His son, Eustache Mazamette , is returned home from school due to bad behaviour, so they go to look for it together. They find some men loading boxes into a house, and notice one of the top hat cases contains a shell. Later, reading that no survivors have been found from the exploding ship, Satanus visits Philipe to avenge Irma’s death. He paralyses him with a poisoned pin in his glove and leaves a bomb in a top hat to kill him off. Mazamette arrives and throws the top hat out the window just in time. At Satanus’ home, Eustache is used as a ploy to hide Mazamette in a box, but Satanus sees this through a spy-hole. Simultaneously Eustache shoots at Satanus as the police raid the building and arrest him. After the action, they find that Mazamette’s nose has been broken by Eustache’s fire. Meanwhile, Irma is shown to have survived the blast on the ship, trying to get back to Paris from under a train. She is helped by the station staff and police, faking that she is in “one of those eternal love stories beloved by popular imagination.” She makes her way to the Vampire hangout, the “Howling Cat” nightclub, where she performs, and is rapturously greeted by the Vampires. Upon hearing of the arrest of Satanus, one of the Vampires, Venomous , appoints himself the new chief. By Satanus’ orders, they mail him an envelope containing a poisoned note, which he uses to commit suicide.   Irma is now a devoted collaborator of Venomous, who is set on getting rid of Philipe and Mazamette. He learns that Philipe is engaged to Jane Bremontier , and the following day Irma and Lily Flower rent an apartment above hers. Irma’s maid, a Vampire also, hears that Philipe and Jane’s engagement party will be catered for by the famous Béchamel House. Venomous cancels their catering order, and on the day of the party the Vampires appear instead. Jane’s mother  gives the servants some champagne as a present, but just as dinner is served one of the concierge, Leon Charlet, is poisoned and killed from drinking it. The landlady stops the party guests from drinking their champagne just in time, and the Vampires make a hasty escape. A few days later, Mazamette and Philipe’s mother pick up Jane and her mother while travelling to a safe retreat near Fontainebleau in the night. Irma, who tries to fill the car with poisonous gas, is spotted by Mazamette, but he is gassed and taken away while she hides in a box on the car. Mazamette is taken to the police station, believed to be drunk, and calls Philipe to warn him, but Irma slips out of the box and gets away in the car before Philipe can catch her. He goes to meet up with Mazamette at the Pyramid Hotel, but spots Irma there and ties her up. While he and Mazamette attempt to ambush Venomous, he saves Irma and drives off in Mazamette’s car, so they chase him in his. Philipe chases Venomous on foot, following him onto the top of a moving train, but he gets away. Mazamette, enraged at the police for not letting him help Philipe on the train, hits one of the officers, who tries to book him, but Philipe persuades them not to.   A few months after their engagement party, and little news of the Vampires, Philipe and Jane are now married. Augustine Charlet , widow of the poisoned concierge, is invited by the Guérandes to be their chamber maid, which she accepts. The following day, she receives a letter from the Vampires detailing that she should consult Madame d’Alba at 13 Avenue Junot. When she does, Mazamette, who has taken an attraction to her, follows her. Madame d’Alba, a Vampire, hypnotises Augustine and instructs her to unlock the door of Philipe’s apartment at 2 am to let the Vampires in. Mazamette catches her as she leaves, and he promises not to tell Philipe of the incident. Unable to sleep that night, he sees her let the Vampires in, and they tie her up and feed poisonous gas into the Guérandes’ room. He shoots at them and they flee, and Augustine explains her actions. As they go to the police, Venomous tries to break in through a bedroom window, but Jane shoots at him. When she looks out the window she is lassoed down and carried away. At daybreak, the police raid Avenue Junot. Irma and Venomous escape through the roof and drive away, capturing Augustine. Mazamette shoots at the car, causing an oil leak. Philipe follows the trail to the Vampires’ lair and lays traps at nightfall while the gang celebrate the wedding of Irma and Venomous. The police do a large scale police raid at daybreak, while the Vampires are still celebrating. As Irma hides, all of the Vampires are either killed or captured by the police. She confronts their captives, but is shot by Jane. Paris now being safe from the Vampires, Mazamette proposes to Augustine and she accepts.
