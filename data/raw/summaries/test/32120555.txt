He is nearly killed but is rescued by his sister who sacrifices her life in the process. Growing to manhood, Steel becomes foreman of a large cattle ranch owned by a kindly but tough woman named Berdie '. Steele and the ranch cowboys deliver their herd of longhorn cattle to the stockyards in the town of Eagle Mesa. As he leaves the cattle yard with his friend Rawhide Johnson ', he encounters his girl, Beth Hendricks . Rawhide leaves the two to talk, saying that he is going to the general store in town for supplies.   Sandy meets Rawhide later in the town as a fight abruptly breaks out at the other end of the street. Three snarly looking men have assaulted an old Indian in town with his Grandson, Little Hawk. Sandy sees the altercation but does not want to get involved. However, when he sees Slade ' knock the boy down, it is too much for him. Sandy quick-mounts his horse, gallops down the street and leaps onto the three men. A fight ensues and when Steel is winning, the other two Jenkins ' and Barton ', grab their guns and attempt to shoot the cowboy. Rawhide arrives on the scene and stops them as Steele finishes the fight leaving Slade unconscious on the street. The three bad men have been humiliated and slink away. Sandy and Rawhide now joined by Beth, help the grandfather and young child load their wagon. As the two Indians and their wagon pass down the street, Slade, Jenkins and Barton watch from a hidden recess by one of the buildings. Jenkins aims his pistol at the passing Indians. Slade stops him, cautioning his cohorts to wait until their targets are out of town. As the sun passes behind a cloud, the three gunfighters ride atop a cliff and wait. Soon, they see Little Hawk and his grandfather riding through the canyon below them. Slade smiles, removes his rifle, takes aim and fires. The grandfather slumps forward and the two horses frightened by the sound break into a runaway gallop. Sandy and Rawhide ride along a ridge some distance from the gunfighters. Rawhide hears the rifle shot as Steele spots the runaway team. He spurs his horse down the canyon’s side and gallops toward the speeding buckboard. He leaps from his horse onto wagon bed and makes his way to the reins. Atop the cliff, Slade fires his rifle once again. A bullet strikes the wagon strut causing Sandy to fall forward under the wagon. He quickly grabs the undercarriage, swings himself back up, and stops the runaways. However, it is too late as the Grandfather is dying. Before passing, the old Indian takes the cowboy’s hand along with Little Hawk’s and places one in the other. His request is that Sandy Steel care for the young boy after the grandfather dies. Steele meets the hand of fate when he becomes responsible for Little Hawk, a young Indian boy whose only family, his grandfather, has just been killed by white men. The cowboy realizes that the child has no one to care for him yet the memories of his own family’s death are too close. He gets into a heated discussion with Berdie and Rawhide.  Berdie takes a hard line with Sandy, accusing him of holding on to the pain and being insensitive. Sandy knows that she is right but has a difficult time letting go of his feelings. Unbeknownst to Sandy, Little Hawk overhears the conversation where Steele expresses his dislike for Indians. Little Hawk already hurt by the passing of his grandfather is hurt even more, thinking he is unwanted. He decides to leave the ranch and wakes early the next morning to do so. He finds and old gun and takes it, his Indian pony and runs away. His mission now, is to track, locate and kill the three men that murdered his Grandfather.  Later than morning Beth Hendricks arrives at the ranch to see whether she can help. She discovers that Little Hawk is missing and alerts Sandy and his friend, Rawhide. Together, the two set out to find the young boy before he can get hurt. Sandy and Rawhide manage to find Little Hawk who has already found the gunfighters’ trail and is tracking them. Little Hawk refuses to leave until the killers are found and justice is served. Sandy and Rawhide decide to go forward and try to capture the bad men. They corner Jenkins but not before, he wounds Rawhide. A gunfight ensues at the top of a high cliff where Jenkins accidentally falls to his death. Sandy and Little Hawk bandage Rawhide and proceed on forward. The Indian and Cowboy eventually track the remaining killers. Barton is captured as Slade tries to escape on horseback. Steele follows in pursuit, catches up with him and knocks him from his horse. The two tumble down a tall embankment and furious fight ensues. In the end, Sandy defeats Slade and the two bad guys are taken back to Eagle Mesa where they are tried and hung. In the film’s final scene, Sandy and Rawhide are alone as the sun sets in the western skies. Sandy tells the story of his childhood and apologizes for the things he said that Little Hawk overhears. The little Indian nods in understanding. As Sandy extends his hand, Little Hawk takes it before erupting into a tearful hug. In the end, each has overcome their own prejudice and biases to find their better selves.
