Oswald is dancing on an urban street until it suddenly starts to rain. He then runs into what was called a "five and ten cent store." Because his shorts were quite saturated, Oswald grabs a wringer and heads somewhere within the store to dry it. The place he went to, however, turns out to be the shop's display window where the outside crowd saw him and laughed. While looking at what the store retails, Oswald befriends the store clerk whose appearance resembles the girl beagle. The clerk asks Oswald if he could play the piano. Oswald agrees to her wish as he plays the instrument and sings the song I Found a Million Dollar Baby. Thus a lot of the store's patrons started taking note on his performance. As everyone watches Oswald's exhibition, a puppy, who looks like a browner version of the boy beagle, parts from his mother and decides to explore the store. After a few moments of wondering, the puppy saw a stout man and a thin man. Obliged to play a prank on the two men, the puppy throws a fish at the stout man's head. The stout man thought the other person did it, and therefore delivers a haymaker onto the thin man. The thin man was sent airborne, knocking all the dishes off the shelf. To avoid trouble, the puppy knocks a statue off its platform, and replaces it with himself. The store's manager steps out of his office and was infuriated by the mess. Believing Oswald was responsible, the manager expelled the young rabbit from the store and fires the clerk. Oswald and the disposed clerk went on to buy wedding garments, got married, and found themselves a home.
