{{Plot}} Based loosely on the Finefrock/Koon story, the film follows a group of teenagers living in a fictional planned community called New Granada. The film begins with Carl Willat  and his friends, Ritchie White , Claude Zachary , and Johnny  hanging out at the rec, which is the only place in the community where young people  can spend time and be somewhat supervised by rec counselor Julia . From a vantage point above an overpass, Mark Perry  and his friend shoot a hole in the windshield of a passing patrol car with a BB gun and flee through New Grenada on their bikes. They pass Carl and Ritchie and tell them to hide because the police are on their way. Sgt. Ed Doberman , arrives shortly, spots the boys, and pulls them from their hiding place in the weeds behind an electrical control box. He searches them and finds a three-inch pocket knife in Ritchie's pocket, so he shoves the pair into the patrol car, takes them to the station, and calls Carl's father Fred , to come pick up the boy and warns him about the pair's delinquent behavior. Carls father Fred Willat is the owner of the local Cadillac dealership and is well-connected within New Grenada's business community. Before getting Doberman's call, he is talking to Homeowner's Association president Jerry Cole  about getting wealthy Texas landowner Mr. Sloan  to come to see the land across the street from the rec, and hopefully build an industrial park there instead of the planned twin cinema and roller rink, thereby making the community friendlier to business at the expense of the local kids. Back at the police station, Doberman is questioning Ritchie and Carl about who had the BB gun when Ritchie utters the most famous quote from the movie: "I only got one law: a kid who tells on another kid... is a dead kid." Ritchie is then taken out of the room while Doberman continues lecturing Carl and warns him that, if he continues his bad behavior, he will likely end up at the hill, an infamous juvenile detention facility in the area. Once home, Carl goes upstairs to his bedroom and blares Cheap trick on his headphones. The next day at school, Carl and Ritchie tell Claude about their misadventure with the police, and Claude announces that he took speed  to prepare for an upcoming test: a surprise creative writing assignment related to the slide of a painting that was projected onto the classroom wall. The audience is not sure if the image shown in the film is the actual painting or merely Claude's ghastly, nightmarish hallucination. Afterward, the students are assembled in the school's Cafeterium for a presentation about the recent shooting of the police car, where Carl exchanges looks and smiles with Cory . That evening, Carl gets dressed to go out  and then goes downstairs and asks his father about the land across from the rec. Fred tells him about the new proposal for an industrial park, telling him that it would be a better reason for peopel to move to New Grenada than "a bowling alley," [sic] and the apoplectic Carl storms out to go join his friends over at the rec. The kids have brought pot, alcohol, and music to an impromptu party at the rec's playground, where Claude buys a gram of hash from his friend Tip . An announcement about a party at a boy's nearby house spreads through the crowd of kids, and the group migrates there to encounter a burgeoning party replete with everything teens are into: sex, drugs, beer, and Van Halen. Carl is handed a joint on his way to the basement, where he sees Mark making out with Cory on a couch. Coming over for a hit from the joint, Mark threatens Carl by saying that if he mentions his name to the cops, he'll be eating through a tube, then melts away into the party. Carl gets upset with Cory, telling her that she could do a lot better than Mark. Carl then leaves, followed  by Mark and his friend. While Carl is walking home alone, they jump him, beat him up, and take his money. When Carl gets home, he tries to avoid his parents seeing the cuts and bruises, but fails. Carl gets questioned, but, when refusing to tell them who jumped him, runs upstairs and locks himself in his room. Fred and Jerry Cole then talk about making sure The Rec is closed the next day, when Sloan comes to visit. The next day at The Rec, everyone is talking about Carl's event, but he only releases the names of his attackers to Claude, Ritchie, Johnny, and Alan , another friend of theirs. While they're talking, Julia , The Rec counselor, goes outside to talk to Doberman about The Rec staying open. Doberman goes inside and searches Claude, finding the gram of hash in his pocket, and taking him in. However, when they walk outside, Ritchie is standing on the cop car, and makes the cops chase him around the grounds. When the cops finally leave, Carl, and Ritchie go to get sodas, where Ritchie gives Carl firecrackers. They then get on their bikes and ride around the neighborhood, where they find Cory and her best friend Abby  running out of a house, carrying a plastic bag. They stop them, and grab the bag, finding a gun in it, which the girls stole from the house. They then all go to a half-finished town home, which Carl and Ritchie call their condo. After planning a picnic with a gun Cory gets up and starts dancing, with the gun in her hand, pointing it at Carl playfully, but the gun goes off, and Carl scares everyone into thinking he is shot. The group then goes their separate ways. When Carl gets home, he sees Sloan's car in the driveway, and, upset at his father, places the firecrackers given to him by Ritchie in the car's engine, so that when the car is turned on, they will light. Sloan and his boys, scared, then leave, but not before warning Fred that if he doesn't stop to listen to his son, it will come back to bite him. The next day, Carl calls Claude and Johnny, telling them to come to the picnic. They all show up, and after shooting the gun, and realizing that Carl is the only one with any sense of aim at all, they start walking. During the walk, Claude tells them that it was Tip who sold him the hash, and Cory announces that Tip had recently gotten busted for possession. They then decide to pay Tip a visit, and while the boys hold Tip down and interrogate him, the girls ransack his kitchen. Tip tells them that he told Doberman who he sold the hash to, because he was arrested last month. Ritchie then points the gun at him, preparing to shoot Tip, but Johnny lights a firecracker that makes a gun sound, which Tip's mother interprets as her son being fatally shot. Before leaving, the boys throw Tip in the water under his porch. Before Cory and Abby leave Carl and Ritchie, Cory runs over to Carl and gives him a kiss, showing him that she likes him as much as he likes her. When Carl gets home, his mother tells him that he is forbidden to see Claude or Ritchie any longer, and that The Rec will be closed until a new counselor can be found. Carl gets in a fight with his father, and when Carl takes a swing at him, he smacks him across the face, causing him to, once again, lock himself in his room. The next day at school, in science class, Carl overhears Tip's mother and the school's principal  talking in a connected classroom. Tip's mother tells the principal the names of the boys that assaulted her son, and this causes Carl to snap. He then grabs Ritchie in the hallway and they run home. Ritchie grabs his gun, and they steal his mother's car, leaving town. However, Doberman sees them leave, and chases them. During the chase, Carl begs Ritchie to throw the gun out of the car, but he refuses. The car then gets flipped over, the two boys running in opposite directions. Ritchie points the gun at Doberman, who mistakes it for loaded, so Doberman shoots and kills Ritchie. Carl then runs away to his condo, but not before calling Johnny to confirm that Ritchie is really dead, and calling Cory to tell her to meet him. She brings a sleeping bag, and they spend the night together. After Cory leaves in the morning, Carl runs home to grab money, and along the way he sees Mark riding his dirt bike. He takes Mark's B.B. gun, and shoots him in the shoulder , causing him to flip over his bike. Mark then sits down with Carl, talking about what they're going to do about the parent situation. They then decide that their fight was stupid, and they make up. Then Carl goes home, and upon climbing into the house through an upstairs window, he sees his mother on the phone with his father about a big meeting at the school that night, to talk about the new trend of violence with the children. He then locks himself in his mother's room, and gets on the phone, asking his parents if they wish he got shot, too. After leaving his home that night, Carl goes to The Rec, where, all of his friends are. They then make a plan to show the parents that they need to listen to them: lock them in the school's auditorium, and wreck the school. Carl climbs onto the roof, entering the school through a sun window above a science classroom. The kids then take their bike chains and lock the gates surrounding the auditorium. The children decide that the only thing that will make them feel better is to trash the school, and all of the cars in the parking lot. However, when they find guns, all hell breaks loose. The kids run around shooting cars and lighting firecrackers in school-owned property, causing massive explosions and fiery mayhem. When Cory almost gets blown up by an explosion caused by Mark, and can't find Carl, Claude and Johnny agree to take her home, but not before Johnny gives a phone to Julia, who is sitting by a gate in the school. Julia calls the police, and as soon as they hear sirens, all of the kids split, some getting arrested. The police unlock the auditorium doors, and Doberman runs out to find Carl. He gets in a cop car, and drives down the road until he finds Carl. He handcuffs him to the backseat, and tells him that he will have to go to The Hill for a couple of weeks. However, Mark, who is waiting down the road with his B.B. gun, shoots the car, causing Doberman to run it off the road into The Rec. Doberman gets knocked out, and The Rec catches on fire. Carl grabs Doberman's keys, and unlocks himself from the car. He runs away, and stops and turns around just in time to see The Rec blow up, killing Doberman. The final scene shows Carl in the morning, coming handcuffed out of the police station. Carl stops and hugs his parents, and is then escorted onto a bus  by Lincoln , another police officer. He is sat at the back of the bus, and driven down the highway to The Hill. However, when they go under the overpass,  they see Claude, Johnny, and Cory waving from above. Carl then turns around to face the front of the bus, quite content with the fact that his friends are safe, and that Cory still loves him.
