The cow town of Spurline is effectively ruled by Virgil Renchler , owner of the Golden Empire ranch. One night, some of Renchler's hands beat a young laborer, Juan Mart√≠n, to death. The newly elected sheriff of Spurline, Ben Sadler , decides to investigate the matter. During his investigation, he must contend with Renchler's henchmen and the fierce opposition of the townspeople, who fear Spurline would be ruined without the Golden Empire's business.
