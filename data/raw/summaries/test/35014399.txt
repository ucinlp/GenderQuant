The film portrays the turbulent life of the “Great Z”, an engine driver on the Abidjan - Ouagadougou line for twenty years. He was laid off in 1995 by the National Railways of Burkina Faso following the privatization imposed by the World Bank. A seasoned reveler and a hedonist to the bone, he suddenly finds himself with no reason to live. He has lost everything and lives a gloomy life while waiting for his retirement pension. Tormented and employing a brutal and violent vocabulary, he emphatically describes his problems, his hatreds and his hopes.
