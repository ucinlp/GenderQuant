Lord Vishnu shows a love story between 2 orphans Ravi Teja , a settlement broker in Hyderabad and Ileana , a taxi driver living in Bangkok. Panileni Papayya  sits at a shop, eats a banana & throws the peel on the road. Using the peel, Lakshmi Devi creates a small problem which leads C.I. Subbaraju  killing Sandy, a trusted goon of the absent-minded Don Prakash Raj  of Bangkok. Thus to settle the problem between the two, Ravi Teja goes to Bangkok. At the airport, a taxi driver Goli ([[Ali  steals the bag of Ravi Teja which has his belongings including passport. He chases him in Ileana's cab but his efforts are in vain. Feeling bad upon learning he is an orphan like her, Ileana invites Ravi Teja to her home. Next day he finds Goli, who is a die-hard devotee of Lakshmi Devi and meets Prakash Raj through him and settles the problem. Prakash Raj, who lusts after Ileana, asks Ravi Teja to send Ileana for a night. He bashes his entire team and runs to Ileana who is already in love with him. Both quarrel and get separated. Unhappy with the turn of events, Lakshmi Devi goes into the past and makes Papayya throw the Banana peel into a dust bin instead on the road.
