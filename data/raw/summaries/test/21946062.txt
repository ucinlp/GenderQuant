Unborn children control our romantic destiny. Every intuitive nudge we feel on earth comes from one of our potential children, pushing us toward a prospective mate, trying to bring themselves into the world. The Prebirths spend their lives wandering a stark desert landscape until they connect their X and Y pair. These children speak to their parents through X and Y crystal orbs, each with a direct tap into the subconscious of their mother and father. Our story focuses on Toby, a Pre-Birth who has been waiting to be born for 5,000 years. Fate seems to be stacked against him. His current X and Y live on opposite sides of the world. Will he fail again? If faced with the ultimate decision of life on earth will he leap into the unknown or remain in limbo?
