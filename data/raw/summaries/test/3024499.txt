The film is set in fictional Port Henry, Alaska, a town undergoing stress as the local economy switches from an industrial one based around the canning and paper industries towards a tourism and leisure based model. Joe Gastineaux  is a former high school basketball star and fisherman who quit fishing after some undisclosed tragedy. He now works as a handyman, particularly for Frannie and Lou, a lesbian couple who own the local resort hotel. Joe is friends with teenager Noelle De Angelo  who also works for Frankie and Lou. At an event which they are working, Noelle's mother Donna , a lounge singer, breaks up with her live in boyfriend and asks Joe for help in moving. The two of them become close and eventually begin a romantic relationship. Meanwhile, Joe gets the chance to return to fishing when Frankie and Lou ask him to work a fishing boat which they have acquired as collateral from local fisherman Harmon. Donna has a strained relationship with her daughter Noelle, due mainly to Noelle's disapproval of her mother's peripatetic bohemian lifestyle. This is exacerbated when Donna begins dating Joe, who Noelle had had a crush on. At a bar Donna overhears the story of why Joe quit fishing: he had been involved in a deadly sinking which claimed the lives of all of his boatmates, including the brother of local bush pilot and small time criminal "Smilin Jack" Johannson . Things change when Joe's dissolute half-brother Bobby shows up. He asks Joe to help crew his boat to pick up a client. Joe brings along Donna and Noelle. They dock for the night in an isolated bay and Bobby reveals the truth: Bobby had been involved in marijuana smuggling and had dumped a load overboard when he was spooked by the police. Now they are going to meet Bobby's partners to settle up his debt. That night, men sneak onto the boat and kill Bobby. Joe, Donna and Noelle flee to a nearby island where the men begin to hunt them. They take shelter in an abandoned cabin and try to survive as they wait for rescue. As they do they grow closer and Noelle finds a diary written by a teenage girl who had lived in the cabin with her family. She spends the nights reading the diary to Joe and Donna. Eventually Donna looks at the diary and discovers that most of it is blank. Noelle had made up most of its contents, expressing her own feelings through the diary. After a week and a half a sea plane sees their signal fire and lands. It's piloted by Smilin Jack Johannson, who explains that his radio is busted and that he doesn't have enough fuel to fly any of them out. He privately tells Joe that he was hired by a couple of men to look around and find three people roughing it. When informed about the murder of Bobby he expresses sympathy and promises to return tomorrow with a full tank and rescue them. Joe, who does not trust Smilin Jack, remains unsure of whether his return will bring rescue or the men who seek to kill them. The next morning Joe, Donna, and Noelle gather on the beach as Smilin Jack's plane flies towards them.
