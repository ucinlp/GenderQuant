The film follows the lives of multiple characters, all of whom are connected by their patronage of a small Brooklyn tobacco shop managed by Auggie . Brooklyn Cigar Co. was located on the corner of 16th Street and Prospect Park West. The film was followed by Blue in the Face, a sequel of sorts that continues following a few of the characters and introduces several new ones.
