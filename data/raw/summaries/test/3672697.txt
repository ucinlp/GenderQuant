This episodic story is set in SÃ£o Paulo's notorious prison Carandiru, one of Latin America's largest and most violent prison systems. Dr. Drauzio Varella arrives at the prison as a volunteer to test the prisoners for the deadly HIV infection. Seeing the disease, overcrowding and rampant circulation of drugs, the Doctor realizes much of the prison is controlled by the inmates. They decorate their cells and have an established pecking order. The strong inhabit messy individual suites and the weak are jammed together, as many as sixteen sharing a {{convert}} cell. Several narratives develop in the film: the attempted murder of Peixeira, the solitary confinement of Chico and the romance between Lady Di and No Way. Dr. Varella establishes a routine and comes to see the prisoners as survivors. The movie ends with a violent prison riot that historically took place on October 2, 1992. The repression of the riot became known as the Carandiru Massacre.
