In his remote jungle hideout, the evil Fu Manchu has discovered a deadly poison in a "lost city" in the Amazonian jungle that affects only men. Women can become carriers of the "kiss of death" by being bitten by venomous snakes. The poison causes blindness, followed six weeks later by death. Using mind control, he aims the women at Nayland Smith and others to prevent them from interfering with his plan to prepare millions of "doses" and spread them around the world's major cities in a plot to control the world.
