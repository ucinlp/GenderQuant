Tokyo. 1910. Dr. Daitokuji Yukio , a former military doctor who has taken over a successful practice from his father and treats plague victims, is living a charmed life: he is a respected young doctor with a successful practice and Rin ([[Ryo , a beautiful wife. His only problem is that she suffers from amnesia, and her past is unknown. However, things begin to fall apart. Both his parents die suddenly, killed by a mysterious stranger who looks just like him. His relationship with his wife worsens after he chooses to cure the mayor instead of destitute denizens of nearby ghettos. While isolated from his relatives, he one day faces the mysterious stranger who turns out to be his long-lost rejected twin, Sutekichi . Bent on revenge, Sutekichi throws him into the garden's well and takes over his life and his wife. The final conflict between the two brothers is realized when Yukio, forced into an animalistic existence in the well, reemerges, prompting the fratricidal fight for the love of the same woman, since it turns out  that Rin had actually once been Sutekichi's lover.
