Opening Title Graphic:As the film begins a message appears and reminds the audience that approximately 30,000 people died during the Dirty War due to the military dictatorship's reign during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The story is then dedicated to the surviving children of the murdered. Two such children, now adults are the main characters. One, Daniela , now has her degree in film and is having trouble finding work. She's hired by an older couple, living in recluse, to film Buenos Aires for them. She goes out and documents the city. Yet, her customers are upset as they don't remember the Buenos Aires Daniela has filmed. She then shoots a reel of tourist-type shots. The other, Damián, played by Nicolás Pauls, works in a low-rent motel who discovers the real story about his parents during the dictatorship. The story is largely episodic, mashing together more than 6 different story lines.
