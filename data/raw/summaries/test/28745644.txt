Detective Mike Conovan  investigates when a former partner is found murdered and carrying $1,000 in cash. Out to dispel a theory that the dead cop was secretly in cahoots with crooks, Conovan's trail leads to a stripper, Lili , whose ex-boyfriend Turk  has apparently pulled off a robbery with a man named Lafe . Conovan tracks down Lafe and places him under arrest, but just outside the police station, gun shots ring out, killing Lafe and wounding the detective. Conovan is convinced by his wife Gloria  that police work is too dangerous. He agrees and tenders his resignation. Lili calls headquarters with a tip for Conovan on where Turk can be found. Detective Fred Piper  intercepts the messge, investigates it himself and is gunned down. Conovan concludes that Lili has been double-crossing him, secretly helping Turk all along. Over the objections of his wife, he gets his old job back with the police force. Turk attempts to pull off an armed robbery, but Conovan gives chase. His vehicle crashes into Turk's, causing it to catch fire. Turk confesses to the murders before he dies.
