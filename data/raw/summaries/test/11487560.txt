A depressed Tom is sitting on the railroad tracks, bent on suicide. Watching from a bridge crossing the tracks from above, Jerry sadly observes that "it's better this way." He relives "the story of a cat with a broken heart" in his head. He relates the events leading up to Tom's depression, beginning with Tom and Jerry as best friends, until Tom found himself attracted to a female opportunist cat who reciprocates his feelings for the time being, but Tom's rival, the much wealthier and richer Butch, watches as she swings from a swing up to his penthouse, and rudely intrudes by grabbing the female right off the seat and kissing her, so knowing how rich Butch is, the cat immediately dumps Tom and becomes his prize. Tom pushes himself and his finances to the limit trying to win his girl back with presents such as flowers, perfume, diamond rings, and a car, but she is no longer interested in Tom, as Butch's presents are much bigger, more expensive, and much more extravagant. Tom has become all but invisible to the gold digging black-hearted cat and now broken-hearted, penniless, and deep in debt, he tries to drown his sorrows in milk. He is about to literally let himself be washed away until Jerry, at the last second, rescues him. Just when his misery could not get any worse, he  sees that his ex-girlfriend is now Butch's wife around the world; the pair drive past him with a "just married" sign on the back of their car. In the final scene, Jerry is content that his girlfriend 'Toots' is faithful to him, when suddenly his idyllic world is shattered as she rides by in a car with another mouse and a "just married" sign. The now-dejected Jerry joins Tom on the tracks. Together, they wait for the incoming train as the cartoon comes to a close.
