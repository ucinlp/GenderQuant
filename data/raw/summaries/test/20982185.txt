In 1994, the small town in Holtville, California near the Mexican border was rocked by the brutal murder of 14-year-old Andrea Hines at the hands of 13-year-old childhood friend Adan. Over the course of three years, Los Angeles documentary filmmaker Constance Jackson went to Holtville to interview dozens of people including family members of the teenagers involved - in an attempt to somehow make sense of this act. Through extensive use of interviews, re-enactments, dramatizations, animation, media coverage, and family archives, Blitz Attack: The Andrea Hines Story Parts I and II are compelling and detailed in the account and history leading up to Andreaâ€™s tragedy and its enduring legacy.
