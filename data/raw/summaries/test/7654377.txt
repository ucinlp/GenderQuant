A wealthy young woman, Agnes , is loved by the identical twin brothers Clyde and Ward Kingsley . She marries Clyde and he immediately begins squandering her fortune. When the money is almost gone, Clyde comes up with a plan to collect on his life insurance policy. As his brother, Ward, who still loves Agnes, is terminally ill, he persuades him to take his place so the insurance company will believe that Clyde has died instead of Ward. Agnes learns of the plan and is angry. She nurses Ward back to health and falls in love with him during his convalescence. Clyde then hires Steve Mercer  and Beth Taylor  to murder his brother. He gets impatient, however, and shoots Ward himself. When Clyde goes to tell Steve and Beth that their help is no longer needed, they mistake him for Ward and murder him. Ward recovers once again and he and Agnes are married.
