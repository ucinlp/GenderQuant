Reprimanded by his father for his poor grades, Alfalfa is told that, unless he improves his academic standing, he'll never get to college. Alfalfa responds, "Doesn't C stand for correct, D for Dandy, and F For Fantastic?" He then laughs this off, informing his father that he intends to sail through college on a football scholarship. Alfalfa dreams that he is a student at "Hale University"  and that he is a big football star with poor grades. During his dream about future gridiron triumphs, Alfalfa is brought down to earth when he envisions himself being disqualified from the inevitable "big game" due to his lousy grades. Awakening from this nightmare, our hero vows to put football on the back burner in favor of cracking the books.<ref namehttp://movies.nytimes.com/movie/226190/Time-Out-For-Lessons/overview |title2008-10-08|work=NY Times}}
