The film is a mix of numerous acts and bits, like a vaudeville variety show, interlaced with a plot line, in the style of the Big Broadcast pictures that were also released by Paramount during the 1930s. In addition to the typical Fieldsian comic lunacy, it also provides a snapshot of some popular stage and radio acts of the era. The ostensible plot line concerns a Chinese inventor trying to sell a "radioscope", an early version of television. Unlike real television, this imagined mechanism did not need a camera, but its monitor could zoom in on acts around the world. The setting is a large hotel in Wuhu, China  and the "international" in the title resonates with the real-life International Settlement in Shanghai. It was actually filmed on Paramount's Hollywood back lot. Fields portrays Dr. Henry R. Quail, who is one of many people—from all over the world—converging on the "International House Hotel" in Wuhu, though he is the only one not hoping to buy  Dr. Wong's television invention, as he was intending to land in Kansas City but went off-course. The film ends with minor characters chasing Fields as he drives Peggy Hopkins Joyce in his American Austin  through the function rooms of the hotel and up and down the stairs, to drive the car into the hold of his autogyro and take off.
