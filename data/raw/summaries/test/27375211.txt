{{All plot}} TiMER is a corporation specializing in a unique matchmaking device. For a nominal monthly fee, the company can equip anyone with a countdown timer that counts down to the point that the customer is brought into contact with his or her soul mate. The night before meeting a soul mate, the TiMER reaches zero, and will begin to beep when the soul mates meet the following day. After more than fifteen years of operation, the company has a 98% approval rating. Oona , an orthodontist, has a blank timer, meaning her soulmate has not been equipped with one. In an attempt to search for her soulmate, Oona brings her latest timerless boyfriend to TiMER in the hope that they will get a matching beep, but, as before, their timers do not match and they separate. Oona begins to express doubt in the effectiveness of the TiMER due to the influence of her roommate and stepsister, Steph, who will not meet her soul mate until she is 43. Steph enjoys her situation by sleeping with men who's timers are about to expire and are looking for a last random encounter before they meet their soul mate. Oona is unwilling to give up on finding her perfect mate, however, she wavers because of a grocery clerk Mikey , who encourages her to live in the present rather than stress about the future. Mikey only has a few months left before he'll meet his soulmate, making their relationship complicated and Oona cautious. Oona discovers there is room for living before meeting her soul mate, but she cannot fully suppress her reluctance. Steph, who works at a retirement home, meets Dan who is there to see his grandfather. They start to form a relationship. Dan doesn't have a TiMER. Meanwhile, Oona discovers that Mikey's TiMER was a fake and they have a fight, they end up making up later, however. With Steph and Oona both happy with the men they have met. They both decide to have their TiMERs removed claiming that it no longer matters what they say. Steph goes first to have hers removed and just as Oona's is about to be removed, her countdown finally starts . Steph encourages her to just remove it anyways but Oona, having waited for this moment for 16 years, decides to keep it on. The next day, it is Oona and Steph's birthday party. Both Dan and Mikey had shown up to surprise them. Steph arrives first and Oona later, since they are still fighting. As Oona arrives, she walks directly toward her sister who is with Dan, she makes eye contact with Dan and their TiMERs both start beeping. Mikey and Steph both make an exit.
