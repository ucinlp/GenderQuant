Srikanth and Sriram are best friends. Srikanth is the only son of Radhika and Raghuvaran who is interested in anything but his academics. He falls in love with Bhumika who also eventually happens to reside opposite their house with her loud-mouthed sub-inspector Mom, Rekha. With the responsibilities of a brother to get his sisters married Sriram leaves for Libya on a job received through Srikanth's parents. Before he leaves, he tells Srikanth that Bhoomika and himself are in love and asks Srikanth to look after his lover until he is back. Srikanth swallows his love secret for the sake of friendship. Meanwhile Rekha arranges for Bhumika to get married to Vijay Adhiraj for his wealth. At this juncture Bhumika and Srikanth lie that they are already married. They both leave their parents and Srikanth starts earning to support Bhumika. Finishing his job assignment Sriram returns only to give yet another family responsibility as an excuse. He apologizes for not being able to marry Bhumika as he is a tight corner to marry somebody else for the sake of his sister's marriage.http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/fr/2002/03/01/stories/2002030101000201.htmhttp://popcorn.oneindia.in/movie-synopsis/3676/roja-kootam.html
