Eve is a woman who was raised by apes in the African jungles, known to the natives as the sacred "White Monkey". A mad scientist is implanting control devices into the skulls of gorillas, plotting to take control of the world by using similar devices on powerful politicians. A soldier of fortune whom the scientist double crossed years before comes gunning for his enemy after radio-controlled gorillas attack a safari camp and make off with a young woman. Eve leads our hero to the mad scientist and the gorillas turn on their master before the underground control center goes up in smoke.
