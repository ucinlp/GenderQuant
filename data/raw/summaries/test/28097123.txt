In Vision, New German Cinema auteur Margarethe von Trotta  tells the story of Hildegard of Bingen  the famed 12th century Benedictine nun, Christian mystic, composer, philosopher, playwright, physician, poet, naturalist, scientist and ecological activist. Hildegard was a multi-talented, fully grounded, highly intelligent woman who was forced to hide her light. The modern world's first female rebel who re-transmitted her visions to the world for the greater glory of God and mankind. Regine Pernoud has called Hildegard “the inspired conscience of the 12th century,” the “Prophetissa Teutonica” and the “Jewel of Bingen.” Pope John Paul II has called her “a light to her people and for her time, she continues to shine even more brightly today.”Review: Hildegard of Bingen: A New Twelfth-Century Woman Philosopher?
