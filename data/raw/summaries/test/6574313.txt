A girl named Susan Jeremy is adored by all the boys at her school. However, there was one boy, Harold, who is taking it way too far. He sends Susan love notes constantly, asking her to be his girlfriend. Finally, when he was turned down for another boy named David and mocked on Valentine's Day, Harold decides he's had enough. After breaking into Susan's house, he kills David by breaking his neck on a coat hanger and running away, laughing maniacally. Now, nineteen years later, Mrs. Jeremy  seems to have forgotten the murder and, more importantly, Harold. However, Harold has not forgotten about Susan. When Susan is sent to her local hospital for a "routine checkup", she discovers someone does not want her to leave. A masked killer disguised as a surgeon is stalking her and stabbing, strangling or beating anyone that gets in his way.
