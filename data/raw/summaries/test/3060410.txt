Flama  and Moko  are two 14-year-olds who have been friends since childhood. One Sunday afternoon, Flama invites Moko to play videogames while his mother is not home. There they have everything they need to survive such as videogames, pizza delivery, sodas, manga pornography and... no parents. But when the power goes out what seemed like a regular day becomes an adventure.
