The movie is divided into three parts, the first part entitled "The Overnight Nation" is sixty-nine minutes long and follows Snake as he joins Philanthropy, an organization created in order to stop Metal Gears around the world. Snake  teams up with Elizabeth Laeken  and Pierre Leclerc  as they attempt to find out what's really going on in "The Overnight Nation". The movie is set in 2007, taking place before or right after the first part of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. A quote from Hive Division states:  "Philanthropy explores ideas such as genetics, which is a recurring theme in the Metal Gear series; memetics, the study of how culture, habits, and information evolve, expand, how it is used and abused."  There is currently no word on when the two proposed sequels will begin production.
