When his ship is torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, Harry Patterson, a World War II merchant marine boatswain, is cast adrift on a launch with a few of his shipmates. While Harry remains calm in the face of disaster, his friend Mudgin prays desperately, promising to avoid women, liquor and fighting and to donate money to the church if they are saved. Harry finds Mudgin's pleas ridiculous, but no sooner does Mudgin complete his pact with God than a rescue plane appears on the horizon and the men are saved. They are then deposited in San Francisco. Mudgin quickly breaks all his promises to God soon after and becomes depressed, certain that he has "lost his immortal soul." While Mudgin's shipmates laugh off his concerns, Harry realizes that Mudgin is truly wracked with guilt and they take a walk, arriving at the city library. There Harry and Mudgin meet the attractive, straight-laced librarian Emily Sears. Although intrigued by Emily, Harry repeatedly angers her with his brutish manner, however his attention turns swiftly to her outgoing roommate, Helen Melohn. Harry and Helen decide to go on a date and convince a reluctant Emily to join them. At the restaurant, Emily stuns Harry when she abandons her reserved demeanor and starts a bar fight and brings the night to a close. Astounded, Harry decides to pursue her affections in earnest and arranges to meet the two women the following day at Emily's farm outside the city. Harry and Emily soon fall completely in love and get married in Reno. However, upon their return to her farm, he tells Emily that he will be shipping out in a few days, which comes as a shock to Emily, who promptly asks for a divorce. Harry sails away, and during his absence Emily realizes that she is pregnant with Harry's child. While docked in a South American port city, Mudgin falls off the ship and claims, before dying in Harry's arms, that his soul has been returned to him. Months after his departure, Harry comes back to San Francisco and finds out from Helen that Emily has long since given up on him and went to her farm to give birth to his child. Harry follows and arrives just as Emily goes into labor. The child is stillborn, but he repeatedly slaps the baby until it begins to breathe. Afterward, Harry and Emily share a tender kiss.
