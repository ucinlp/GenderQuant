San Francisco Assistant District Attorney David Corelli  is called to the murder scene of prominent businessman Kyle Medford, found stabbed to death in his home by an antique hatchet. The lead detectives, Bob Hargrove  and Petey Vesko , find photographs in Medford's safe of Governor Lew Edwards  having sex with a prostitute, later identified as Patrice Jacinto . During questioning, Patrice reveals that she and other women were paid by Medford to have sex with wealthy men at his beach house in Pacifica. She also informs them that the most desired prostitute among the clients was a woman known only as "Jade." Corelli meets with Governor Edwards and his aide Bill Barrett , where he is warned not to make the photographs public, lest the Governor ruin Corelli's career. Corelli is then almost killed when his brake line is deliberately cut and his vehicle goes out of control while driving down a steep hill. The detectives find fingerprints on the hatchet belonging to Katrina Gavin , a clinical psychologist and former lover of Corelli's that eventually married his close friend, defense attorney Matt Gavin . When interviewed, Katrina explains Medford gave her a tour of his antique collection on the day in question, but claims to have nothing to do with his death. At Medford's beach house, Corelli and the detectives find various drugs, alcohol, and sex toys as well as video cameras hidden in guest bedrooms. They conclude Medford was recording the sex sessions in order to blackmail the men. Corelli is shocked to discover Katrina on one of the tapes; the revelation renews the detectives interest in her as a suspect. Patrice calls Corelli and arranges to meet him to discuss Jade's identity, but, prior to arriving, she is killed in a hit-and-run accident by an unknown assailant driving a black 1993 Ford Thunderbird. Corelli, witnessing the murder first-hand, chases the assailants' vehicle, but is unable to apprehend them. The detectives discover the Gavins own a black 1993 Ford Thunderbird and initially suspect Katrina of killing Patrice, but later find the actual vehicle used in the hit-and-run incident abandoned and determine someone may be trying to frame Katrina. Katrina is again brought in for questioning and shown the sex tape but Matt, in his capacity as her attorney, ends the interrogation before she fully explains her involvement. When confronted at their home by Matt, Katrina admits she had sex with the man on the tape, due in part to her knowledge of Matt's many affairs. Katrina later visits Corelli at his apartment and tries unsuccessfully to seduce him, admitting she felt sexually liberated by sleeping with several men at the beach house, despite suspecting Medford of recording the sessions. Meanwhile, Justin Henderson , the only witness to identify Katrina at the Pacifica beach house, is found murdered. Corelli informs the detectives at the crime scene that Katrina couldn't have killed him because she and Corelli were together at the time. Corelli rushes back to his apartment where he is met by Matt, who holds him at gunpoint and angrily accuses him of also having sex with Katrina. Corelli convinces Matt of his innocence and persuades him Katrina's life is in danger. Back at the Gavin home, Det. Hargrove and Governor's aide Barrett search for the incriminating photos of the Governor and Patrice. Hargrove tries to kill Katrina when she interrupts their search, but Corelli and Matt arrive and Matt shoots and kills Hargrove to save his wife. Afterwards, Corelli meets with the Governor to assure Katrina's safety by leveraging his possession of the photographs. The Governor denies any knowledge of Hargrove's or Barrett's actions, but insinuates they were both acting on his behalf. As they get ready for bed, Katrina finds photographs laid out in her bathroom of her having sex with the men at the beach house. Matt admits to Katrina that he killed Medford because Medford would eventually blackmail them both. He assures her they have gotten away with the murder and then asks Katrina to "show him Jade" the next time they have sex.
