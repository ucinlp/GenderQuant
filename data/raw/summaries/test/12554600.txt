Marc and Philippe are two teenage summer-camp counselors at a vacation camp somewhere in the French country in 1960. Marc is very virile, while Philippe is more reserved. One night, Marc surprises Philippe dressed and made-up like a woman. From now on, he will keep on humiliating Philippe. Despite their late-adolescent rivalries and sexual confusion, each of them achieves some sort of awakening.
