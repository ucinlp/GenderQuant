{{Plot}} The film is about a K-9 dog named Ace. The police are trying to catch a robber whom they and the media nickname "Goliath". One day, the police and the dogs are on the track of Torco. Ace's trainer, Daniel, allows Ace to take down Torco. Ace quickly catches up with him. Torco uses a stick with barbed wire to fend off Ace. Then we see Ace on his forearm. He takes Torco down, and keeps him down, until Dan arrives. When the police see Torco's injuries to his neck, they believe it is a result of Ace biting him. They send Ace to a clinic to be euthanized, but he escapes and the clinic worker covers up his incompetence. Dan goes back to the scene of the crime. He sees that the area is under 24-hour surveillance. He goes onto the scene and finds a piece of barbed wire, which he believes Torco used to slashed himself with. Meanwhile, Ace is trying to get back home. Dan tries to get over the grief of losing Ace by trying out with other dogs, but is unsuccessful. Julia, Dan's daughter, sees Ace on the television, but her parents do not believe since Ace's supposed ashes is sent by mail. She convinces Dan to take them down to downtown Wenatchee to see if the dog is Ace, but when they get there Ace has escaped again. During the trip back home, Julia sees Ace, who has hopped into the back of a convertible being towed. Ace sees her and waves his paw at Julia, which is the trick she taught him. Later, the Captain brings Dan in to show the surveillance tape. It shows Torco first fending off Ace with the piece of barbed wire but then starts to slashes himself with it, proving Ace's innocence. Julia stakes out at Torco's house, believing Ace has "unfinished business" since Torco framed him. Torco comes home from work early after being fired, and he sees Julia. He enters his house and finds the box which held the glass cutter open, and goes in the kitchen and sees the drawer with cutlery ajar. He then sees some alum on the floor and open the cabinet and sees the alum container not in the correct position. Julia took some of the alum and took a picture of the cutter before she left. When she arrives home, she finds out that Torco is in the house. She tells her mom and the two of them soon see him. He sees them and chases them all throughout the house and then when they are cornered, Ace comes and brings down Torco. Torco stabs Ace with a piece of glass, but Ace is still able to bring down Torco. Dan arrives and arrests Torco. The family takes Ace to a veterinarian hospital. Later, Dan allows Julia to go to the K-9 competition with Ace, and they win 1st place. Dan and Lily go to Tahiti after Dan asks Lily where she would like to go for the weekend.
