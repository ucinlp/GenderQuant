A police officer is shot down on Christmas Eve when he stumbles upon a robbery-homicide at a convenience store. A down-on-his-luck L.A. County Sheriff's Dept. homicide detective, Jerry Beck , is assigned to the case. As with every case, he takes this one very emotionally, because "the job" is the last thing left in his life, and vows to get the perpetrator no matter what. The slain officer's widow further complicates the issue when she entices Beck into a one-night stand, in the hope that Beck will not only find but kill her husband's murderer. During the investigation Beck learns that the murder of a policeman was just the tip of the iceberg, as he finds the roots of the suspect are in a White Supremacist, Neo-Nazi group. Of interest to trivia buffs-- "Jerome Beck" is listed in the film's closing credits as walk-on character Detective John, and also as the film's technical police advisor.
