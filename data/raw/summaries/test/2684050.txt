Vasco  is a medical student in Lisbon, supported by his rich aunts from Tr√°s-os-Montes, whom he had falsely told he had already graduated. In fact, he devotes himself to a bohemian life, preferring the popular fairs and pretty women, especially Alice , a seamstress from the Castelinhos quarter, which rather upsets her ambitious father, tailor Caetano , who is familiar with Vasco's debts. After failing yet another final exam, he is surprised by his aunts' announcement that they will visit him in Lisbon to see his practice.
