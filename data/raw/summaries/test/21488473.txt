Two men, Clarence James Darby  and his accomplice Rupert Ames , invade the Philadelphia home of Clyde Alexander Shelton , killing his wife and daughter before his eyes. Prosecutor Nick Rice , unable to use DNA evidence to convict the two, bargains with Darby to a lesser sentence in exchange for sending Ames to death row. Shelton feels betrayed by Rice's actions and the justice system at large. Ten years later, Ames' lethal injection goes awry, making him suffer a slow, painful death. Evidence of tampering with the machine leads to Darby. An anonymous caller alerts Darby as the police draw near, and directs him to a remote location. Shelton reveals himself as the caller, and paralyzes Darby. He takes Darby to a nearby warehouse and dismembers him, recording the footage. Darby's body is found, and evidence ties his death to Shelton. Rice and his team track Shelton to a remote cabin, where he willingly gives himself up. Rice initially refuses to bargain with Shelton to obtain a full confession until he learns his wife and daughter were sent the dismemberment recording and were traumatized by it. In court, Shelton represents himself and falls out of order, putting him in contempt of court. During his next interrogation, Shelton demands a fancy steak dinner delivered promptly. Rice agrees, though the dinner is delayed by a few minutes due to the warden's security measures. Shelton provides a set of coordinates, where Rice and the others find the corpse of Darby's lawyer, having suffocated from a lack of an air supply depleted minutes earlier. Meanwhile, Shelton kills his cellmate with the steak bone, forcing the warden to secure him in solitary confinement. Several other deaths of those connected to Shelton's case are killed in unorthodox manners, including Rice's assistant Sarah Lowell  and District Attorney Jonas Cantrell . Rice is led to believe that Shelton has outside help in rigging these deaths, but is later contacted by an anonymous agent from the CIA who explains Shelton has previously worked with the agency as a technical expert in creating devices to assassinate targets in unusual, remote manners. The mayor  puts the city under lockdown and promotes Rice to District Attorney, charging him to resolve the matter. Rice, from an email sent by Lowell previously, discovers that Shelton owns an auto garage neighboring the prison. There, they discover a tunnel leading to a cache of guns, disguises, and other equipment below the solitary confinement cells, along with secret entrances into each. He realizes Shelton wanted to be in solitary, allowing him to easily leave the prison without detection and perform the murders himself. Evidence points Rice to Shelton's next target, city hall, where the mayor is holding an emergency meeting with city officials. Rice and his men cannot find Shelton, but do discover evidence pointing to a cell phone-activated suitcase bomb filled with napalm in the room directly below the meeting; if tripped, the bomb would wipe out everyone at the meeting. Shelton returns to the garage from planting the bomb, and returns to his cell. He is surprised to find Rice waiting for him, proposing another deal. However, Nick refuses, saying that he don't make deals with murderers anymore, but thanks Shelton for making him learn about it. Despite being impressed, Shelton calls the cell phone on the bomb without remorse. Upon this, Rice secures Shelton in the room and flees. Shelton realizes too late that Rice has placed the bomb under his cot. Knowing that he lost, Shelton looks upon his daughter's bracelet, accepting his fate as the bomb goes off, killing him.
