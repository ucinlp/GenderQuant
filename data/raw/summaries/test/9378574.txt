A top scientist called Radcliffe  is kidnapped from a train and his security escort killed. A senior British intelligence officer, Colonel Ross , sends for Harry Palmer , who up to that point has been engaged in a tedious stakeout. Ross tells Palmer that he is being transferred to a department headed by Major Dalby . Radcliffe's disappearance appears to be part of a brain drain; seventeen top British scientists have been taken, then returned with their minds somehow wiped of technical knowledge. Ross introduces Palmer to Dalby as a good man but insubordinate. His file records that he had been court-martialed for black market activities, but offered a job as a spy as an alternative to jail. Ross tells Dalby that his position is precarious, and that "the people upstairs" will close Dalby's department down if it can't get Radcliffe back. Dalby is told not to complain since he's got a very good job for a major repeatedly passed over for promotion. Dalby tells Palmer that his criminal tendencies may be of use, but that if he gives any trouble, he will go straight to prison. At his first departmental meeting, Palmer befriends a young woman, Jean Courtney  and a Scotsman, Jock Carswell ([[Gordon Jackson . Dalby briefs his agents on the Radcliffe kidnapping, saying that they suspect "Bluejay" . Palmer contacts Bluejay, who is willing to arrange the return of Radcliffe in exchange for Â£25,000. Palmer organises an expensive and unauthorised raid that yields nothing but a piece of audio tape, marked "IPCRESS", that produces a meaningless noise when played. Radcliffe is bought back from his captors, but proves to have forgotten everything about his research. Just after the exchange, Palmer spots and shoots an armed man lurking nearby, but is chagrined to learn that he has just killed a CIA agent. He finds himself under CIA surveillance. Carswell finds a book titled "Induction of Psychoneuroses by Conditioned Reflex under Stress": IPCRESS. He tells Palmer, but is killed when he goes to report his discovery. Palmer is caught up in a power struggle between Ross and Dalby. He becomes involved with Courtney, but suspects that she is watching him for Ross. The IPCRESS file disappears from Palmer's desk, leading Palmer to suspect he is being framed. This is confirmed when he finds the body of the CIA agent who was following him in his flat. While leaving London by train, Palmer is kidnapped. Waking up in a cell, he finds that Bluejay is his captor, also being told that he is in Albania. Bluejay subjects Palmer to intense brainwashing, apparently over the course of weeks. Palmer secretly uses a nail from his cell to inflict distracting pain on himself during the sessions. Overpowering his guards, Palmer escapes from his prison to find that he is still in London. Suspecting both Ross and Dalby, Palmer separately arranges for both to meet him at the apparently disused warehouse that had been his prison. After getting off the phone with Palmer, Dalby is shown to be speaking with Bluejay, with whom he'd been working the entire time. Palmer confronts Dalby and Ross as they arrive in the warehouse. Ross admits testing Palmer but insists that Dalby is the double agent. Dalby coolly faces Palmer down, addressing him with the code phrase used during Palmer's brainwashing to make him kill Ross. Palmer narrowly breaks the spell by smacking his hand against metal, inflicting pain on himself as he did while being subject to conditioning. Killing Dalby, Palmer is told by Ross that he had been counting on Palmer's insubordinate nature.
