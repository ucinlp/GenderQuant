During the heist, The curator, Radu, is killed by one of the mercenaries. The mercenaries and Cutter escape on helicopter. Meanwhile, in New York City, Samantha Gaines, an art assistant, is seen talking to someone on phone. Revealed to be Zach, her brother, who is an addicted gambler, he asks for $2000 and a hideout. Samantha responds by saying "I'll be home in a few hours". Zach thanks her, as Samantha leaves for an exhibition. She later meets Jake Addams, an agent. She tells him about the legend of Attila and the breastplate, which contains inscriptions, one of them a location to the Sword of Mars, which is guarded by the three–headed–dog, Cerberus. As Samantha arrives at home, she discovers that Zach is missing. She then receives a call from someone, telling her that her brother has been kidnapped and that she has to obey him if she wants to see him alive again. Samantha, left with no choice, agrees to help them. A car is then seen waiting outside. Near Bucharest, a car is then seen arriving. Cutter steps out of the car, where he meets Kul Jae Sung, an ex–Korean general, Sung is dissatisfied about their early plan, and blames one of Cutter's mercenaries, Max, for the death of Radu, which they need to find the sword, and kills him by unleashing a group of dogs on him. Samantha, arriving in Romania, is picked up by one of Cutter's mercenaries. On the road, they realize they are being followed by Addams. A shootout then ensues. Samantha then stumbles on Addams. Addams tells her that they must stop Sung from retrieving the sword and that they have be careful, as Sung is also carrying a nuclear bomb, which he threatens to detonate. They travel to the cave, in search for the sword. After finding it, however, they stumble upon Cutter and his mercenaries. Cutter retrieves the sword, and escape. Soon after, Cerberus is unleashed. Addams and his men manage to escape from the cave. Cutter receives a call from Sung, demanding the sword. Cutter refuses and breaks their deal. Cutter receives more trouble when he is threatened by two of his mercenaries, demanding a paycheck. Cutter kills one of them by severing his hand and stabbing him in the heart. Cerberus, who has escaped into the woods, begins to kill off the inhabits. Elsewhere, Cutter is confronted by Sung and his men. Cutter, who is willing to keep the sword, declines, and as a result, he is shot in the head. As Sung is about to pick up the sword, Cutter's wound somehow heals, and decapitates him. Shocked, Sung's men shoots him several times, but not before they can be killed one by one. A phone then rings, it is revealed to be Kwan, who Sung is working for. Not knowing that he is dead, Cutter responds by saying that "Mr. Sung will no longer be calling the shots". After hanging up, he is surprised by the town's inhabits, and manage to kill some of them. Cerberus, who has finally arrived at the town, attacks the inhabits. Cerberus attacks Samantha and Zach. Cutter finds Addams and a final battle ensues. Cutter drops the sword when he misses Addams, and falls to his death when he is thrown off and eaten by Cerberus. Samantha then see her chance, but is stopped. Addams kills Cerberus by impaling him.
