In the Duchy of Cornwall of fairy tale days, the sorcerer Pendragon  plots to gain power by abducting the Princess Elaine . To that end, he has fashioned a magic toy that is actually Cormoran the giant. When Cormoran seizes Elaine, a brave farm lad named Jack  slays the monster and rescues Elaine. In gratitude, King Mark  makes Jack her protector and entrusts him to safely guide her to a convent across the sea. Pendragon learns of the plan and sends his witches to intercept Jack's ship. Elaine is captured, while Jack and his friend, Peter  are cast overboard. An old Viking, Sigurd , rescues the two and introduces them to Diaboltin , a leprechaun imprisoned in a bottle. With the help of his new allies, Jack rescues Elaine from Pendragon's castle. As the friends flee, Pendragon sends a two-headed giant along their path but Diablotin summons a monster from the sea to defeat it. As a last resort, Pendragon transforms himself into a dragon, but Jack slays him in a tense battle. With evil routed at last, all sail away to live happily ever after.
