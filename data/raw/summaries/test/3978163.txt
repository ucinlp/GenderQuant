Tripp , a 35-year-old man, is still living with his parents Al  and Sue , in Baltimore, Maryland. Tripp's best friends Demo  and nerdy Ace  are also still living in their parents' homes and seem proud of it. Al and Sue are not happy, and are fascinated when friends whose adult son has recently moved away from home reveal that they hired an expert to arrange the matter. The expert is Paula , who theorises that men continue to live at home out of low self-esteem. Her approach is to establish a relationship with the man to build up his confidence and transfer his attachment from his parents to her. Her step-by-step process is deceitful; while avoiding physical intimacy, she allows her subject to fall in love with her, pretending to like what he likes, allowing him to help her through a  crisis, obtaining the approval of his friends, and giving him the opportunity to teach her something: he then moves out to become more independent. Tripp is soon discovered to not fit any of Paula's previous profiles, having normal social skills and no problems with self-esteem. He does not commit to long term relationships, and uses his living with parents as a dumping mechanism. After an awkward encounter with his parents, Paula thwarts his attempt to dump her and stays for the night, all the while developing real feelings for him. She and Tripp find themselves sailing unfamiliar waters and confide in their friends. Paula's vocation exasperates her terminally-hip roommate, Kit , who believes that Paula's own breakup with a live-at-home man is the unhealthy motivation behind the job to which she has given over her whole life. Paula, on the other hand, is shocked when the true reason for Tripp's situation is revealed to her: his life essentially collapsed when the woman he was engaged to suddenly died, leaving him emotionally devastated, and his family has been his source of solace ever since. She read her mark all wrong. Entrepreneurial Ace discovers what is going on and blackmails Paula for a date with Kit; although Kit is more attracted to slacker Demo, she and Ace wind up bonding over a problem and fall in love. Ace spills the beans to Demo, who in turn ultimately reveals all to Tripp, leading to the film's crisis. Tripp confronts both his parents and Paula, who split in bitterness and guilt, and Tripp moves out, possibly never to speak to his parents or trust a woman again. Wracked with guilt, Paula refunds Al and Sue's money, but can't escape being scathingly dressed down by Kit for essentially being an arrogant con artist. After an awkward confrontation , Tripp manages to forgive his parents despite not understanding why they couldn't be upfront with him. Still, he can't forgive Paula for her manipulations. Tripp's parents and friends devise a plan to reconcile the two lovers. They tie up and gag Tripp and lock him and Paula together in a room, while a contrite Paula pours her heart out to him. In the end, it seems that falling in love, and moving out of one's parents' house, are all part of following nature's course. The movie ends with Al and Sue in their empty nest, happily singing "Hit the Road Jack", and Tripp sailing away with Paula on his newly-purchased boat .
