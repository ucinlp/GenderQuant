The film documents the lives of lesser flamingos on the isolated shores of Lake Natron in northern Tanzania, revealing the breeding and parenting habits of the species. After mating, the flamingos breed chicks that grow up, always on the move trying to enjoy their lives. Along their journeys, they encounter vicious marabou storks  who kill many unborn and newly born chicks and a villainous spotted hyena who takes no pity on the elderly flamingos. As the film progresses, it focuses on the life of one of the chicks that at birth is separated from her mother and the flamingo clan when the Storks attack. On her own, she successfully dodges the Storks and rejoins the clan of flamingos where she grows up. With no mother or father to look up to, the mid sized flamingo has to teach itself the key habits of the species. She successfully grows up to become a large, pink feathered flamingo and survives when the clan is attacked by the Hyena. Her story is focused on to show the strength and determination for life the flamingos have.
