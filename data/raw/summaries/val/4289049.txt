Marisa Paredes is Leocadia  Macias, a woman writing “pink” romance novels under the alias of Amanda Gris that are very popular all across Spain. Unlike her romantic novels, her own love life is troubled. Leo has a less than happy relationship with her husband Paco , a military officer stationed in Brussels then later in Bosnia, who is distant both physically and emotionally. The film starts when Leo writes about the feeling of having lost her lover, a feeling which Leo compares with the pain of an uncomfortable pair of boots that she can't take off. Leo begins to change the direction of her writing, wanting to focus more on darker themes such as pain and loss, and can no longer write her Amanda Gris novels, whose publishers demand sentimental happy-endings, at least until her contract is up. She begins to re-evaluate her life through her relationship with her husband, her supposed best friend Betty, her "crab-faced" sister Rosa and her bickering elderly mother. She also meets Angel , a newspaper editor who quickly falls for Leo and her writing. After having signed the contract with the newspaper El País, the editor realises that instead of a pink novel, Leo had written something very different from that. Leo, confesses that she forgot writing pink novels, and that her sentimental situation led her to write a black novel about a young mother whose daughter kills her husband because he tried to rape her. After that, the corpse of the dead man is hidden in a refrigerator . Leo went to the apartment where her sister Rosa  and her mother  live. There, Leo sees a very comical scene between them. After that, she went where her best friend Betty lives. There, Paco, her husband makes a phone call talking about his situation during the Bosnia and Herzegovina wars. When she was writing at night, Leo received a phone call from Paco who tells her that he had permission to see her for 24 hours. After hearing this, Leo's humor changed suddenly and she starts preparing for the visit. Once Paco arrives, Leo sees that her husband's behavior is strange and that he tries to avoid her. Finally, he tells her that actually he didn't have 24 hours of leave as he said before but in fact that he had only two hours. After hearing that, Leo got really angry and sad. That sadness is bigger when Paco leaves for his mission telling her that there's no way to save their relationship.
