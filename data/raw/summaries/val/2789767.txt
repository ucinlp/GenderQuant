{{Unreferenced section}} A Greek fisherman named Demetrios  and his father rescue Princess Antillia  from a shipwreck without knowing that she is from the technologically advanced civilization of Atlantis. After rescuing an Atlantean princess, Demetrios must travel beyond the Pillars of Hercules to take her home. Upon returning her to her civilization, Demetrios, while expecting to receive a reward, is instead enslaved and forced to fight in the arena, to undergo the ordeal of fire and water. The king, Cronus , is being manipulated by an ambitious usurper, Zaren , using an evil sorcerer  who wishes to use the resources of Atlantis to take over the world. The slaves of Atlantis have been mining crystals which absorb the sun's rays and can then be used to fire heat rays. Due to arrogant corruption and moral laxity, the country has become an abomination before heaven. Demetrios fights with a giant ogre in a pool of fire and water. The ogre appears to be about 350&nbsp;lbs. , and Demetrios outmaneuvers him and lights his hair on fire, the fight contrasting with uproarious laughing from the massive crowd in the "coliseum" and goofy scenes of spectators holding bunches of grapes while cheering them on. The House of Fear, where slaves become beasts is one of the plot's less-successful points. Demetrios is partially transformed into one of them. Unexpected religious overtones enter the story. Impending doom hangs heavy in the air. The birds and animals flee the approaching destruction. Through the help of a kind, spiritual high-priest named Azar , Demetrios is able to rescue the princess from the wicked spells of the sorcerer and his malicious pretender to the throne, and escape from the spectacular destruction of Atlantis in the climactic finale. Azar and Zaren wrestle each other as the huge crystal ray device sweeps about uncontrollably, zapping this and that until it destroys both the usurper and the high priest. Eventually, the earth moves, thunder crashes, and the volcano erupts, as the survivors flee to different parts of the world, spreading the legend through their own mythology.
