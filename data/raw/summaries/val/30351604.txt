The film begins with the director discussing it with the producer. Michael Orraya, an American entomologist, is requesting a visa to Georgia, so he can get to South Ossetia.  At the same time, Zhenya, an old schoolmate of Michael's and a Russian journalist, is doing the same, however, they are told conflicting information. Michael is going to make a film about a rare type of moth, and Zhenya is coming at the request of Michael's father. When they arrive, they are told by Akhsar, a resident, that the Georgians are leaving the village. They are coming to the conclusion that something is going to happen in the village soon. However, the Ossetians are not preparing take measures, especially after the airing of a televised speech of Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili. The events take place the evening of 7 August 2008. Late in the evening, Michael and Zhenya set up special cameras in a nature reserve in order to film the moth, the Olympus Inferno. During the night while goofing around in the reserve, the two are taken prisoner by Georgian forces. Thanks to the interference of an American military officer, the Georgians clarify that Michael is not a Russian, but an American. He is released, and requests that Zhenya also be let go, claiming that she is his fianc√©e. At that moment, the Georgian tanks head for the road to Tskhinvali. In response to Michael's question about what is going on, the American offer answers, "an operation for directing constitutional order." Zhenya screams, "This is war!" and she and Michael run away. Zhenya and Michael return to their recording equipment to find footage of the Olympus Inferno moth, as well as footage of the Georgian offensive in the same video. The two take the disc and all of their equipment and hide it in a neighboring building that is the remnants of a destroyed church. But it becomes clear that Zhenya has the disc of the Georgian offensive on South Ossetia. And then a hunt is declared on Zhenya and Michael, who then decide to make their way to Russian peacekeepers in Tskhinvali. Along the road to the town they come across its residents, who say that Tskhinvali is being bombed. Initially the residents ask Zhenya and Michael whether they are Russian. Zhenya answers that they both are Russian. The residents then give them something to eat and drink. Among the Ossetians is a guy named Gabo, who is eager to fight with Georgian forces. However, his mother will not let him go. When at the crossroads  it becomes clear that their path leads to a different part of Tskhinvali, Gabo's mother releases him so he can escort the protagonists.
