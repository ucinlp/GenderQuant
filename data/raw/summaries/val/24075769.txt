In a little village, lost at the bottom of a valley in the midst of mountains and deprived of sun for long months, an old man Anzerul , prophet and magician, announces the end of the world. According to his calculations the sun will not return to the village and the village will descend into an endless winter. The villagers give way, one after the other, to panic, piling up wood or giving themselves up to drink. Only Isabelle Antide , holds up against the hysteria. She urges them not to give in to terror, and to struggle against a damaging fatalism. On the 13 April, the day the sun returns to the village each year, she leads them above the cover of fog which hangs over their valley.
