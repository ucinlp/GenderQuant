During the fall of Saddam in 2003, two Kurds are looking for the parents of an Arab boy named Saddam. At the same time the boy's parents are looking for him everywhere, worried because his name is now taboo. All the attempts of the two Kurds  to get rid of the child fail: neither the Americans nor clerics at the mosque want him. Little Saddam begins to become a real problem. Azad overcomes ethnic differences and tries to help the boy find his parents, much to the objections of Rashid, whose family was wiped out by Iraqi troops under Saddam during the anti-Kurdish campaign in the 1980s. Azad is killed while trying to protect the boy from Saddam's troops, who want to take him back. Rashid puts aside his animosity and carries on with the task of helping the boy find his parents.
