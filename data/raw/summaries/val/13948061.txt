Jakub , a dreamy mail carrier in a sleepy village, spends his days playing pranks on everyone, resenting his father  with his mother's  tacit support, and admiring Jolana  from the neighboring Romani hamlet — until Jolana responds. Faced with mistrust from both Jakub's and Jolana's families and venom from segments of their communities, Jakub pulls one more, grave prank that, he imagines, will help support the two teenagers as they take the train to the nearby city in order to live together. Yet, not only does Jakub's prank — a theft of money from the post office — catch up with him, but it turns out that the two of them have conflicting dreams about life. Jakub has dreamed up an urban version of the stereotypical fantasy of a free-spirited Gypsy life with Jolana, whereas she has dreamed of a grounded life away from her troubled community and applies herself to achieve that. While Jakub goes from fantasy to prison to fantasy, Jolana gets a steady job and begins to realize that Jakub is no more her fantasy of a down-to-earth Gojo  than she is his "Gypsy woman". As Jolana, back in the Romani hamlet, celebrates her wedding to her persistent Romani suitor Vojto  and Jakub returns to his parents for more idle dreams, a Romani woman, the Town Hall administrator Irena , and a Slovak man, the Town Hall maintenance guy and volunteer firefighter Ondro , a more mature couple from a subsidiary plot, are getting married too.<ref name http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/sstopics/movieclips/rosydreamswriteup.html | title  2010-06-18 | last  Martin | work  University of Pittsburgh}}
