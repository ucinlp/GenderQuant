After his roommate committed suicide, Marco begins to realize that his life is very similar to his friend's. Perhaps even more hopeless. A lack of prospects and a strong sense of inadequacy only darken his mood. Deep in crisis, the young man asks his brother Davide to travel with him to Holland, where he wants to accomplish what his friend Maurizio had so lucidly planned to accomplish: assisted suicide. He confesses that he wants to end it all, he wants to stop being such an outsider, stop the suffering. Davide, who has gotten used to his brother's crises and ravings over the years, doesn't give his requests the least credence. He doesn't know – he cannot know – that Marco's plan has at least a semblance of plausibility. Indeed, the Dutch protocol on euthanasia extends to the category of mental distress. The day after the two of them talk, Marco runs away from the Community where he is living, and takes a train to Amsterdam, intent on completing his desperate mission. At the very moment when he’s trying to save his relationship with Nina, Davide is forced to acknowledge the gravity of the situation and leave for Holland. Tired as she may be of watching what she considers to be a sadistic game, Nina is not prepared to leave Davide to face this crisis alone. The unexpected journey offers an opportunity for the couple to be together again, after a period of separation. On reaching Amsterdam, Marco loses himself in this city of bright lights and attractions. Almost forgetting why he travelled there in the first place, he roams around on a bike, with no particular place to go. He's very much cast adrift, but then he also feels more free than he ever has before. Like a condemned man, he allows itself one last wish: an intimate relationship with a woman – a prostitute. Meanwhile, Davide and Nina have made it to Amsterdam and started to try and find him. One evening, completely by chance, Davide sees his brother streak by on a bicycle. He races after him, and in the end manages to block him near the port. They have a massive argument. Marco has no intention of giving up on his quest, but Davide manages to persuade him that his suicide mission is impracticable. The doctors he has spoken to have told him in no uncertain terms that Marco's condition is not eligible for euthanasia. And even if his condition was eligible, as a foreign citizen he would still not qualify for assisted suicide. Marco has to face the facts and give up. The three of them head home. They fly to Pisa, and then drive the rest of the way to Rome. En route, Davide nods off and they are very lucky not to be involved in a car wreck. Davide decides to turn off the main road and find somewhere to stop and have a snooze. The three of them, all exhausted, fall asleep in the car. A magnificent dawn lights up a desolate and uninhabited stretch of Mediterranean countryside. A passing train wakes Marco. The young man sneaks out of the car. Nina and Davide are still fast asleep as he strides away from them. Nina wakes up soon after, and realizes that Marco is gone. This is the point at which the epilogue starts, then it is the beginning of the film. Nina wakes Davide.They come out of the car and go looking for him. Marco, wandering in this wilderness, arrives by chance at a beach. After a few moments, he instinctively throws himself into the sea. Davide reaches Marco and seeing him in the water, he throws too. The film ends on Nina, Davide and Marco, the two still wet, returning to Rome.<ref name CinemaItaliano Film Page | work  CinemaItaliano | url  October 27, 2011}}
