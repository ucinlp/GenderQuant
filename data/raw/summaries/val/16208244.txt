Sam Hurley  and Bart Moore ([[Paul Kelly  escape from prison, although Moore is seriously wounded in the breakout. They meet up with a confederate, a mute named "Dummy" , and hide out in a ghost town. Along the way, they pick up several hostages, Kay Garven  and her lover Arthur Ashton , reporter Larry Fleming , dancer "Dottie" Vale , and the town's sole resident, Asa Tremaine . Larry tries to warn the gangsters that the government is going to conduct an atomic bomb test nearby the next day, but Sam, their leader, does not believe him. When Arthur causes trouble, Sam kills him without a qualm. Meanwhile, Sam discovers that Kay's husband is a doctor. He phones Neal Garven ([[Richard Egan  and threatens to kill his unfaithful wife unless he meets them. To Kay's surprise, Neal still loves her enough to show up. He successfully operates on Bart, but warns Sam that moving his friend too soon will kill him. When Sam finally realizes that Larry was telling the truth, he still waits as long as possible to give Bart time to recuperate. Then, little more than an hour before the bomb is scheduled to go off, the gang prepares to leave in their car; a desperate, self-serving Kay barges into the vehicle. Larry overpowers Dummy, but the others drive away. Unbeknownst to everyone, the test has been moved forward an hour due to favorable weather conditions. When the five-minute warning sounds, the doomed criminals frantically try to speed away, realizing it is hopeless. Asa leads the others to a cave. After the detonation, the four emerge unharmed.
