The film is told in flashback from the point of view of horror author Franklin "Frankie" Scarlatti on his way to his hometown Willowpoint Falls. On Halloween 1962, Frankie , then 9 years old, is tricked by school jokesters Donald  and Louie  and ends up locked in the school's cloakroom. Trapped well after dark, he witnesses a girl's ghost being murdered and then himself is attacked by a dark figure. Losing consciousness he speaks to the ghost who asks for his help to find her mother. Frankie is revived by his father and rushed to the hospital. The police arrest the black janitor, Harold "Willy" Williams , who was found drunk in the basement, believing him to be the attacker. As Frankie recovers at home, Frankie's brother Geno  brings him a newspaper article about the attack and he learns it was linked to the deaths of eleven other children at the hands of a serial killer. He also learns the name of the ghost - Melissa Ann Montgomery . She continues to haunt Frankie and the two become an odd sort of friends. Striving to help her, he returns to the cloakroom and discovers several objects including her hairclip and an old high school class ring. Later, Frankie overhears the chief of police talking to his father Angelo  about the case against the janitor crumbling and the cloakroom being the scene of Melissa's murder. Frankie confides in family friend Phil  that the class ring probably belongs to the killer and that he thinks the killer returned to the cloakroom to search for it. Unbeknownst to Frankie, Geno has discovered and taken the class ring. The school jokesters lure Frankie out to the nearby cliffs, where they encounter a lady in white clothing living inside an abandoned cottage. The children take off running and Frankie runs into his brother Geno on the way home. Frankie tries to explain everything to Geno, but Geno doesn't believe him. One evening though, Melissa appears to both of them and, despite Geno's injured foot , they follow her through her nightly death re-creation. They trail behind her lifeless body as it is carried by an invisible figure out to the cliffs. At the last minute, she awakes and begins screaming as she is thrown over the cliffs. A ghostly lady in white  then comes out of the cottage and throws herself over the edge after she sees Melissa's lifeless body. Willy, the school janitor is finally brought to court, but a grand jury decides against going to trial due to insufficient evidence. He is subsequently murdered by the mother of one of the serial killer's victims. The real killer is still at large though and Geno uses the class ring to track him down after realizing that their father and the killer wear the same exact class rings. Angelo's yearbook reveals that the initials on the ring, M.P.T., belong to Michael P. Terragarossa. Geno knows, however, that the "P" stands for Phillip, as in, their family friend Phil and he rushes to tell his father. Frankie happens to be with Phil at that same time and as well realizes that he is the killer after Phil starts whistling "Did You Ever See a Dream Walking" . Phil catches on that Frankie has deduced his secret and attacks him, but Frankie escapes and runs to the cliffs. Phil catches him and confesses to the murders just before he starts to strangle Frankie. Phil is struck from behind and both Phil and Frankie collapse to the ground lifeless. Regaining consciousness, Frankie finds himself in Melissa's old cottage with his savior Amanda Harper . She reveals that she is Melissa's aunt and has been living in the cottage since her sister and nieces' deaths. She was the first lady in white Frankie had seen. Phil reemerges in the cottage and kills Amanda, setting the building ablaze in the process. Pulling Frankie from the burning cottage, Phil then tries to throw Frankie from the cliff, but the ghostly lady in white appears and scares Phil over the edge. Melissa as well appears and the two ghosts ascend into the sky finally reunited. As Frankie is crawling away from the cliff edge Phil grabs his ankle. Angelo, Geno, and the police arrive saving Frankie. Angelo tries to save Phil, but overcome with shame, Phil lets go and falls to his death, despite Angelo's pleas not to. With Phil gone, the movie ends as the group watches the cottage burn as the snow begins to fall.
