The British Government agree to loan the priceless Kohinoor diamond for an exhibition to multi-billionaire Vinay Kumar, on posting the security of Vinayâ€™s jewel collection worth Rs.500 billion. Despite top security the Kohinoor diamond gets stolen. The prime suspects are Vinay himself, as simultaneously his jewel collection posted as security goes missing; Police Commissioner Surya Dev Singh, the very last person to have supposedly handled the diamond as also being the son of Prince Arjun, the jewel thief from the original film; Con-man Johnny, who has acquired a reputation of being a jewel thief; Jukaso, a gangster of international repute; and Chief Minister Neelkanth who had, in the presence of Surya Dev Singh, kept the Kohinoor in his safe. With the Chief Minister and the Police Commissioner themselves suspects, no one really knows who the real criminal is.
