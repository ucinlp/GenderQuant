Max  is a plumber working in the apartment building complex into which anthropologist Jill Cowper  and her husband doctor Brian  have recently moved. Max appears uninvited at the Cowper apartment claiming their plumbing needs repair, even though the couple has noticed no irregularities. Convincing them that the problems with their plumbing are not easily noticed, he begins work in their bathroom by dismantling some pipes. Max's work on the bathroom drags on for days and it becomes increasingly obvious that he is only doing more damage by tearing out walls and pipes and rendering the bathroom useless. Over time, Max begins to frighten Jill by taking the liberty to use their shower without permission and playing guitar and singing songs in the bathroom while he was supposed to be working. He also makes his way into the apartment through the roof when the door is not opened for him. The damage he caused to the bathroom eventually leads to a serious injury to a house guest who happens to be an official from the World Health Organization. The Cowpers are able to rectify the situation but Max, a self-declared "rock-and-roll rebel", is unrelenting.
