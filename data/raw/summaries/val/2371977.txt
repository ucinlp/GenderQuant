Jon recognizes that he needs a life; to escape from his boring existence as the guy who routinely arranges his sock drawer. Garfield is suffering the same way, growing bored watching his favorite TV show, "Yukon Stinky". Jon reads a book called How to make friends and fool the rest and attempts to find a girlfriend, but is unsuccessful. All the women he asks out find him to be a dweeb. Even a giant thug hates Jon's singing and music playing. One night, Jon sees an advertisement on TV for "The Lorenzo School for the Personality Impaired" and decides to attend. He meets a lady named Mona and starts a friendship with her without using any of the techniques they learned in class. Garfield, fearing that their companionship could soon turn into marriage and children, hatches a plan to end the relationship. Lisa scratches Garfield's back, he tickles her nose, she breaks into a sneeze fit, leading him to tickle her nose more. Jon decides to take her back to her house, and Garfield chaperones them by sticking on the back window of Jon's car using suction cups, Ã  la the Garfield "Stuck On You" plush toy. At the end, Jon must choose between his girlfriend and his furry companion. He, of course, chooses the latter.
