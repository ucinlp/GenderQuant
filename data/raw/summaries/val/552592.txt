Gordon Bombay  is a successful Minneapolis defense attorney, whose truculent courtroom antics have earned him no respect among his peers. After being arrested for drunken driving, Bombay is sentenced to community service by coaching the local "District 5" PeeWee hockey team. Bombay has a history with the sport, although his memories are far from pleasant: he blew a penalty shot, costing his team the title and disappointing his hyper-competitive coach, Jack Reilly . In fact, the movie later shows Reilly with Bombay looking at his string of championship banners and disgustedly saying that the runner-up banner should be taken down. When Bombay meets the team, he realizes the kids have no practice facility, equipment or ability to go with it. The team's first game with Bombay at the helm is against Bombay's old team: the Hawks, the team from the snooty suburb of Edina. Reilly is still head coach and remains bitter about Gordon's shortcoming in that fateful game. District 5 gets pummeled and after Bombay berates the team for not listening to him the players challenge his authority. Meanwhile, Bombay discovers his old mentor and family friend Hans  who owns a nearby sporting goods store was in attendance. While visiting him, Bombay recalls that he quit playing hockey after losing his father four months before the championship game. Hans encourages him to rekindle his childhood passion. Bombay approaches his boss, Gerald Ducksworth  to sponsor the team, which Ducksworth reluctantly agrees. The result is a complete makeover for the team, both in look  and in skill . Now playing as the "Ducks", they fight to a tie in the next game and recruit three new players: figure-skating siblings Tommy  and Tammy Duncan  and slap shot specialist and enforcer Fulton Reed . The potential of Ducks player Charlie Conway  catches Bombay's eye and he takes him under his wing. Bombay learns that star player for the Hawks, Adam Banks , actually resides in the Ducks' district boundaries and threatens Reilly into transferring Banks to the Ducks. After hearing an out of context quote about them, the Ducks players lose faith in Bombay and revert to their old habits. Ducksworth makes a deal with Reilly about the Hawks keeping Banks, however Bombay refuses since it would be against fair-play, which Ducksworth berated him about when he started his community service. Left with either the choice of letting his team down or get fired from his job, Bombay takes the latter. Bombay manages to win back the Ducks' trust after they win a crucial match and Adam Banks proves to be a valuable asset. The Ducks manage to make it to the championship against the Hawks. Despite the Hawks' heavy attacks taking Banks out of the game, the Ducks manage to tie the game late and Charlie is fouled by a Hawks player as time expires. In the exact same situation as when Bombay was a child, Charlie prepares for a penalty shot to win the championship. In stark contrast to former coach Reilly's attitude , Bombay tells Charlie that he will believe in him no matter what happens. Inspired, Charlie jukes out the goalie with a "Triple-deke", , to defeat the Hawks for the state Pee Wee Championship. The Ducks and family race out onto the ice in jubilation, where Bombay thanks Hans for his belief in him and Hans tells Bombay he is proud of him. The movie ends with Bombay boarding a bus headed to a minor-league tryout. Although he seems daunted at the prospect of going up against younger players, he receives the same words of encouragement and advice from the Ducks he had given them, promising he will return next season to defend their title.
