British medical student Martin E. Blake  transfers to a Southern California hospital to start his residency. Charming and handsome, Martin is in reality an arrogant individual who longs to wield power over others. After starting out badly with patients and on thin ice with his superiors, 18-year-old Diane Nixon  comes in suffering from a kidney infection, which gives Martin a boost of self-esteem. However, when her health begins to improve, Martin fears losing her and begins tampering with her treatment to keep her next to him in the hospital. Ultimately, the infection kills Diane. An orderly, Jimmy , discovers this after he discovers Diane's diary which describes their relationship and threatens to expose Martin unless Martin gives him a steady supply of drugs. When Jimmy reveals that he will never give the diary to Martin, Martin laces the drugs with potassium cyanide and kills Jimmy. A police detective comes to the hospital to investigate the death and Martin tells him that if he has more questions, he can come to his home. The detective shows up at Martin's apartment and asks further questions about the incident of Jimmy's death. Martin then heads into the bathroom to tear up the diary and attempts to flush the pages down the toilet. But the toilet overflows and Martin jumps out the of the bathroom window and runs towards the ocean in an attempt to drown himself, only to reveal that this was a flash forward in Martin's mind. He climbs back through the window into the bathroom. Martin collects himself and cleans up his mess in the bathroom and heads out to inform the detective that he needs to head over to the hospital. Martin is seen in the last scene of the movie helping patients and giving orders to a nurse. It ends with the phrase 'Don't worry, I'm getting better all the time.'
