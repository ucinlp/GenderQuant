Accused of assaulting a foreigner, Raul has no choice but to flee, but Elio must decide whether his own escape is worth abandoning his beloved sister. Brimming with the nervous energy of Havana's restless youth and evocative cinematography of the sun-bleached capital. Una Noche follows one sweltering day, full of hope and fraught with tensions, that burns to a shocking climax.http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/best_new_narrative_director_award-film42911.html#.T5wnQLOP-So Tribeca Film Festival - Retrieved April, 2012.
