Determined to better herself, Maisie Ravier graduates from the Benson Business School in Los Angeles, but has to fend off the advances of Mr. Benson. She encounters the same problem at her first few job interviews - the men are interested in something other than her secretarial skills - so she dresses as dowdily as she can and gets hired by Joseph Morton. Morton has invented a helicopter that is easy to fly and gotten financial backing from J. G. Nuboult. Morton suspects Maisie is an industrial spy when he learns of her deception, but she convinces him she was merely trying to avoid romantic trouble. He assures her she will have no such difficulty with him. He is thrilled to learn that she worked during the war helping assemble the very bombers he himself flew, and introduces her to his men: World War II crew mates Mitch O'Hara and Bill Stuart, and college friend Tim Kingsby. Then he sets her to work not only in the office, but also at welding and other assembly tasks. Eventually, Maisie and Morton fall in love and become engaged. Unbeknownst to Morton, Kingsby, Nuboult and Nuboult's daughter Barbara are scheming to steal his invention. When Maisie notices that they are being billed for twice as many parts , Barbara invites her to a Sunday social at an exclusive club, where she spikes her drink. Maisie ends up diving into the pool with her clothes on. Feeling she is no good for Morton, Maisie goes into hiding. Morton persuades Seattle tycoon Floyd Hendrickson to come to a demonstration at the Rose Bowl, while hiring a private detective to search for Maisie. Then the plotters set their plan into motion, burning down the workshop, stealing the prototype and leaving behind their copy. Maisie becomes suspicious when Nuboult shows up with Morton's canceled contract immediately after the fire is put out. When she cannot find in the wreckage the medals she welded to the helicopter for good luck, she guesses the truth. She, Mitch and Bill follow Tim to where the real helicopter is stashed. A fight breaks out when they try to get it back. Maisie is told to take the helicopter up. She manages to fly through Los Angeles to the Rose Bowl, where an impressed Hendrickson signs onto the project.
