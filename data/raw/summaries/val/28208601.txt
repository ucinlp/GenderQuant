The Screen song starts with the theme of Little Annie Rooney. She returns home to a surprise birthday party. She replies "Im so Happy", which is similar to Betty Boop's Birthday Party. Annie has a sweetheart and they both perform the title song, followed by the Bouncing Ball. During the live scene a statue of Betty Boop can be seen in the background.
