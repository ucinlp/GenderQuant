The Royal Hong Kong Police Force is planning a major undercover sting called "Operation Boar Hunt" to arrest crime lord Chu Tao . Inspector Chan Ka-Kui  is part of the operation, along with undercover officers stationed in a shanty town. However, the criminals spot the police and the ensuing car chase cuts through the hillside shanty town. Ka-Kui persists in his chase, eventually following on foot as the drug lord attempts to escape in a double-decker bus. Ka Kui manages to get in front of the bus and bring it to a halt by threatening to shoot the driver with his service revolver. Later, Ka-Kui is reprimanded by Superintendent Li for letting the operation get out of hand, but subsequently presented to the media as a model police officer. His next assignment is to protect Chu Tao's secretary, Selina Fong , who plans to testify in court about Chu Tao's illegal activities. At first, Selina insists that she does not require protection, but after Ka Kui has a fellow policeman break into her apartment and pose as a knife-wielding murderer, she becomes more cooperative. When Ka-Kui arrives at his apartment with Selina, he is surprised by his girlfriend, May  and her friends, who are throwing a birthday party for him, but May becomes angry with Ka-Kui after seeing Selina only wearing lingerie and Ka-Kui's jacket. Not knowing that May would come back, Ka-Kui tells Selina during the shower about his differences with May hearing in. Ka-Kui later explains to May that Selina is a witness, but an upset May leaves the scene, though she does go to Chu Tao's trial the next day. Meanwhile, Selina discovers that the attack at her apartment was a sham, and thus records over her confession about working for Chu Tao that took place in the car ride there. She sneaks away while Ka-Kui is sleeping and is not present at the trial the next day. It is a failure for the prosecution because of Selina's tampering that made the court think Ka-Kui and she were engaging in sexual activity. Though Chu Tao is released on bail, he wants revenge against Ka-Kui. He captures Selina and plans to kill her to ensure her silence. Ka-Kui finds and frees her, but is attacked by several of Chu Tao's men. When fellow Police Inspector Man arrives , he reveals that he had been working with Chu Tao and thus Selina's capture was bait to lure Ka-Kui. However, Tao's men then kill Man with Kui's gun, thus framing him for murder. Now a fugitive cop killer, Ka-Kui must try to catch Chu Tao and clear his name, taking his superindendent as hostage. Selina goes to Chu Tao's office at a shopping mall to download incriminating data from Chu Tao's computer system. Chu Tao notices this and he and his men head to the shopping mall to intervene. Ka-Kui and May, who are monitoring Chu Tao's activities, follow. In the ensuing fight, Ka-Kui defeats all of Chu Tao's henchmen. The briefcase containing the computer data falls to the ground floor of the mall, but Chu Tao retrieves it after attacking May. Ka-Kui, at the top floor, sides down a pole wrapped in lightbulbs to the ground floor. As the entire police force arrives, Selina reveals that Chu Tao, not Ka-Kui, killed Inspector Man. Ka-Kui then violently apprehends Chu Tao and his defense attorney, but is held back humorously by his two friends Tak and Kim before things go too far.
