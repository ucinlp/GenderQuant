The Stooges are crooked gamblers in the Old Western town of Lobo City. Eventually, they are caught cheating the residents  of a frontier town. They are discovered and must escape into the woods. To elude the sheriff, the Stooges hunt, fish, and disguise themselves as Indians. However, things start to go wrong when Pierre takes a liking to Curly, who is disguised as an Indian squaw. The two soon get married. A few minutes later, Curly's wig slips off and the trio has to make another run for it. They find what they believe to be a safe place to hide, only to find that they lock themselves right into the Lobo City Jail.
