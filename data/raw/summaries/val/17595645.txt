Max Doyle  is an 11-year-old whose love of performing magic disappoints his father  and draws ridicule from his older brother, Colin . While doing laundry in the basement, Max hears voices. While investigating the source of the sound, he sees a hand come out of the wall. A hidden tunnel behind the wall happens to harbor the evil Phears  and his cadre of ghosts. Phears is intent on freeing himself and his minions from the world of ghosts to inhabit the physical world but will be able to do so only on Halloween. Later, Max finds the ghosts of two children, Nicky  and Tara Roland , have suddenly come to occupy his room. They explain that they need his help in learning who they are, how they came to be ghosts, and what has happened to their parents.Although they cannot be seen by anyone but Max, they are able to interact with objects in the physical world. This allows them to frighten a boy who has been bullying Max at school. Shortly thereafter, Tara and Nicky learn it was Phears who killed their parents and now holds the ghosts of their parents captive. During rehearsal of Max's magic show, Tara is captured by Phears. Max tells Nicky about it and suggests Nicky throw him into the basement tunnel to find her. The same way people see no ghosts, ghosts cannot see Max. He retrieves a box from Tara that contains a ring to defeat the evil ghosts, but Phears prevents her from escaping with him. Traci , a girl Max has been crushing on, becomes his assistant for his magic show. They perform with the help of Nicky moving objects around, making it appears Max is actually moving them with his magic. On Halloween, Phears finally breaks the tunnel wall and crashes the show. There, Max chants the spell  and Phears minions are sent back to the depths of the earth but Phears himself escapes in the form of a roach without anyone seeing him.
