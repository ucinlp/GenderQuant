Rhea  has just done her JC  and she already fancies herself marrying her charming, rich boyfriend Luv Nanda  who in turn, fancies winning this contest called BBC , which is a rage amongst billionaire boys. It is seen that the boys upload videos of themselves with girls, while making out and stuff, on the website, and the more you do so more you get the points. Luv Nanda was going to become the highest scorer that year. This was shown to Rhea by the brother of a friend of Rhea. The only way for Luv to win this contest was to get Rhea into bed with him on her 18th birthday eve as, this would've provided him another 1,000 points, which would've propelled his profile to untouchable heights for that year. She goes along naively until she realizes that it's not love but points that Luv wants to score. Now out to get him by the balls, she has a plan up her sleeve with her gal pals. Rhea makes a pact with Minty  and then goes to take everything from Luv Nanda by which he attracts girls . She breaks his car, screws his date with Natasha, spikes his drink with a kind of drug after which, comes the famous Mutton Song where, Luv dances in a bar, dressed up like a girl. Then, at Golu's party, where Freddy Kapoor  came to play, she takes Luv to a room where hidden cameras were put to shoot the whole proceeding. Luv, who's found out about Rhea's plan, ties Rhea's hands. But, she unties herself and sprays pepper-spray on Luv and proceeds to tell him that, though girls don't have balls, they sure do know how to kick them after which, she kicks Luv's balls. When she comes out of the room, she finds everyone cheering for her. The film proceeds to have Freddie Kapoor drop Rhea at her home and asking Rhea for a date to which Rhea replies by telling him to call her. In a semi post-credits scene, we see Timmy telling Luv that he  is gay and he knows that so is Luv  and jumps on him after lowering his pants.
