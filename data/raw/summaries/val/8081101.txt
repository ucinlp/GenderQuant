 The film tells the story of a love-triangle set in Bohol during World War II; though the main underlying themes deals with Filipino nationalism and the legacies of colonialism. The story takes place on the island province of Bohol, located in Central Visayas, before and during the Japanese Occupation of the Philippines. Duroy  is a banca operator who is in love with Iset , the most bewitching girl in a village where the main thoroughfare is the river. Iset is an obedient child whose father and materialistic aunt hope that she will marry the American businessman she works for, and thereby marry "up" into wealth and status instead of marrying one of the hard-working Filipino village men. The resident American businessman, John Smith , is an abusive, rude and stingy landowner, but he has taken notice of Iset's beauty and is interested in her—although it is not clear if he is considering her as a wife or merely as a mistress. Iset, however, has made it plain that she likes Duroy who she asked to express his love in a letter. Duroy takes his time in trying to win the love of his life, but Ibô , Duroy's brother, is also smitten with Iset and moves more quickly. Since Duroy adores his family and does not want to get in his brother's way, he stops courting Iset. Duroy is devoted to his family, who now only consists of his mother , Ibô and his sister, Bikay . Duroy's father left them earlier to go off with an American . Heartbroken and ill, Duroy's mother eventually dies when they have no more money to buy medicine. Smith sees Ibo talking with Iset at the warehouse and fires him on the spot. Ibo tries to kill Smith. Smith successfully fights for his life and kills Ibo in self-defense instead. Duroy vows revenge. When the Japanese invasion begins, Mr. Smith is drafted into the American army and has to leave the village. The commander of Japanese forces that garrison the village after the Americans are defeated also notices Iset, and her aunt makes plans to marry Iset to the Japanese officer. Meanwhile, many of the men flee to the mountains while the women and children remain with the American priest in the village. Several years pass. Duroy and his men in the mountains launch an attack against the Japanese garrison. The Japanese respond by taking hostages and killing the priest. Eventually a mixed group of Filipino and American troops arrive in Bohol to help the Boholano guerrilla force defeat the Japanese troops during the Second Battle of Bohol in 1945. Duroy kills the Japanese commander—his new rival for Iset's hand—after a long fight in the village. Smith  returns after the war over expecting life to continue as it was before the Japanese invasion. Duroy attacks him, beats him up and humiliates him but stops short of killing him. Iset refuses Smith's clumsy offer to renew their relationship and chooses Duroy. The end implies a once-more blossoming romance between Iset and Duroy.
