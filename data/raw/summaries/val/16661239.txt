Newly-married Rebecca leaves her husband's Alsatian bed on her prized motorbike—symbol of freedom and escape—to visit her lover, Daniel, in Heidelberg. En route, she indulges in psychedelic and erotic reveries as she relives her changing relationship with the two men, before crashing into a truck at the film's conclusion. It is based on the novella La Motocyclette by André Pieyre de Mandiargues . In the medium to distant shots, the rider was the British GP champion Bill Ivy, wearing a blonde wig.
