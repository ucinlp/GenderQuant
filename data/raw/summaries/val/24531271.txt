In the year 2019, a gang of bandits calling themselves the "United Regime" invade the town of New Hope. They are led by General Quantrill , a descendent of the famous Confederate cavalry officer William Quantrill. A mysterious motorcycle riding gunslinger called Yuma  arrives in town and joins the gang, but plays the thugs against each other, causing the drunken riders to shoot each other. The next morning Yuma's love interest Sarah kills two others from the gang, but the Regime believes Yuma is responsible. Yuma hunts down his accusers and shoots six of them. He is chased by the rest of the gang to the tire refinery, but kills them all, including Quantrill's son. The sole survivor, Ackett  escapes to warn Quantrill. Most of the townsfolk flee but Sarah stays to help Yuma. Quantrill descends on the town with his entire army, only to find the road blocked by coffins filled with the bodies of his son and troops. Enraged, he shoots Ackett with a shotgun and enters the town, only to find it empty. The buildings, rigged with explosives, are detonated and most of Quantrill's army is destroyed. The remaining thugs converge on the town center and are attacked by armed townsfolk. Quantrill spots Yuma in a tower and sends his men after him. When they enter the tower Yuma abseils down and detonates a bomb hidden inside. Meanwhile, Sarah's son hides in an armored school bus which is later hijacked by Quantrill, who is chased by Yuma and Sarah. Yuma climbs into the bus and crashes it into a wrecked car. Quantrill and Yuma lie on the injured road, both within reach of their guns. Yuma draws first and kills Quantrill. Yuma loads Quantrill's corpse onto his bike and reveals he was a bounty hunter tasked with capturing Quantrill, before riding off into the sunset.Steel Frontier
