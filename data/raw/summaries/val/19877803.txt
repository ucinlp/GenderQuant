The film is about a hit man  who gives a compulsive gambler  one hour to live. The movie takes place in real time and its ultimate subject is what we do with the time we have in this world. The film begins when Andy, a hyperactive compulsive gambler, is plucked off the street by the calm yet imposing hit man, Reuban. Reuban tells Andy that he has been dispatched to kill him. Andy does not believe him at first. He figures it is just another one of Reubanâ€™s scare tactics to get him to pay off his gambling debt. Andy soon learns Reuban is not bluffing. Reuban gives Andy just one hour to do whatever he wishes. In his one hour Andy is educated about his mistakes, visits his former workplace, visits his old school, visits his grandmother, gets shot at, and learns about luck, love, and choices.
