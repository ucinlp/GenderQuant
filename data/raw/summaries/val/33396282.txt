Jojo , a young ne'er-do-well, finds a job as gigolo at the Quickie Express; at Quickie Express, all gigolos pose as pizza delivery boys. After training, he and fellow gigolos Marley  and Piktor  begin at the bottom of the hierarchy, servicing less desirable clients. For satisfying them, the three are soon promoted. While at a bar, the trio meet Lila ; after she is injured in a bar fight, Jojo brings her home to keep an eye on her. Although she leaves before he wakes up, they not long afterwards meet at the hospital when Marley has to have a piranha removedâ€”he had thought the fish was a Flowerhorn cichlid and was bathing with it. Jojo and Lila begin dating; at the same time, Mona  takes Jojo to be her exclusive gigolo. At Lila's birthday party, Jojo learns that she is the daughter of Mona; he also meets her closeted gangster father, Jan Pieter Gunarto . He attempts to break off his contract with Mona so he can be with Lila, but she threatens to tell her daughter about his status as a gigolo. At the same time, Gunarto attempts to make advances on him but is turned down. Unable to cope with Mona's sexual demands when he loves Lila, Jojo visits her at work and tells her that he is a gigolo; she does not accept this, and breaks off their relationship. Gunarto tells his bear Mattheo  of his heartbreak. Mattheo becomes enraged with jealousy and drives to Quickie Express to find Jojo, leaving Gunarto behind. After ransacking the building, Mattheo chases Jojo through Jakarta to a fairground where he corners Jojo on a Ferris wheel. Jojo falls, but is caught by a trampoline erected by Marley and Piktor; when the Ferris wheel starts moving, Mattheo falls to his death. Jojo later becomes a pimp for Quickie Express, while Marley and Piktor find work elsewhere.
