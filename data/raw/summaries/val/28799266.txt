A millionaire is about to commit suicide by leaping off of his yacht into the sea. He is just about to go when he spies a bum attempting suicide himself. The rich man saves the bum and tells him of his frustration with his friends and relatives who are always seeking a handout.

The next day, the tramp awakens to find the millionaire gone, and that his own tattered rags have been replaced by the finest clothing, along with a large roll of francs. The bum then begins circulating the millionaire's story around the town. As a result, people all over the country begin treating the homeless with kindness and respect. Eventually the disguised millionaire meets and marries a circus performer and donates his million francs to the whole community.
