Jim King  is the rich owner of a toy company and a constant pain for his closest competitor Krakström  from whom he keeps snatching important toy contracts. As a result, Krakström's company is nearing bankruptcy, which causes friction when King starts dating Krakström's daughter Sylvi . However, King's company can't make a profit since the taxes they must pay increase exponentially as the company becomes bigger. As a way of keeping his company in business, King tries to get his company a tax break by hiring the country's best gangster, Nitti , to break into his safe which isn't ensured. However, his dutiful Treasurer  has the safe ensured just as the crime is to be committed, thus undoing his scheme. When the theft is reported in the papers, Krakström gets the idea of collecting the insurance of a painting in his office, and by sheer coincidence hires the same gangster to commit the crime. However, the painting ends up returned to Krakström against his will by the well-meaning Jim. Krakström also attempts to fake his own daughter's kidnapping to get his hands on King's money, but King gets it back by copying the scheme. While this is going on, King's Treasurer suddenly comes into possession of a large amount of excess money even though all of the company's cash has been deposited in the bank. Not realising that he has actually turned in the cash-boxes which contain his sandwich-making materials, the Treasurer begins to spend the money on driving lessons, a new car, hygiene products and in putting an ad in the paper to find himself a woman. In a final desperate effort, Krakström hires Nitti to rob a bank and involuntarily involves King, who is trying to help Sylvi who has discovered that the bank is missing 500,000 marks. The money is obviously that found by King's Treasurer. While King attempts to return the money to the bank, Nitti then decides to do as Krakström originally instructed and rob the bank clean. King manages to defuse the situation with some laughing gas and when the police take Nitti, Krakström, King and his associates to the station, Nitti's bag is revealed only to contain the cash-boxes with the Treasurer's sandwich equipment. In the end, Jim and Sylvi get married and in a show of good-will, King writes Krakström a check to save his company.
