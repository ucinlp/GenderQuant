Christopher  is a very serious minded young man. Enrolling into college as a freshman he finds his roommate is someone named Alex. Alex , however, is not male but female and the two have been placed together by a computer error. Christopher finds the pairing intolerable and tries his best to find another place to live. The dorms are full and he is resigned, at least for the time being, to make the best of his current situation. Alex, a seemingly extroverted party girl, shows little interest in academics and treats Christopher as if he is simply an annoyance to be brushed aside whenever need be. As fate intervenes, the two slowly begin to realize that they do like one another after all which manifests itself into a sexual relationship wherein each finds a need filled by the other.
