Mera Naam Joker is divided into 3 chapters. The first chapter is about the adolescent Raju and deals with his infatuation with his teacher Mary . She gives him confidence in himself, and he discovers the world of femininity and desire. But of course she's older than him, and he attends her wedding in a state of false merriment. Mary's lessons nevertheless aren't lost: Raju comes to realise that he was born to make the world laugh, despite his own troubles. After his first heartbreak, the story follows adult Raju who has found work with Gemini Circus as a clown. His dream materialises! The circus is owned by Mahendra Singh  who has understood Raju's potential and gives him the job.
