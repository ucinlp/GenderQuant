Via the portraits of four Slam artists, NÃ«ggus, Luciole, Hocine Ben and Julien Delmaire, the film offers a vision of the diversity of the Slam movement in France and delves deeper into the roots of this oral tradition. By means of evenings open to the public and interviews, it shows us artists that have retaken the French language and made it their own beyond any geographical or social barrier, as well as a renaissance of poetry and writing.
