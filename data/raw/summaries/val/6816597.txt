Giovanni Pontano , a distinguished and successful writer, and his beautiful wife Lidia  visit their dying friend Tommaso Garani  in a hospital in Milan. Giovanni's new book, La stagione , has just been published and Tommaso praises his friend's work. They drink champagne together, but Tommaso is unable to hide his severe pain. Shaken by the sight of her dying friend, Lidia leaves, saying she'll visit again tomorrow. Giovanni stays behind a while longer. As he leaves his friend's room, a sick and uninhibited young woman attempts to seduce Giovanni before being interrupted by the nurses. Outside the hospital Giovanni sees his wife crying but does not comfort her. As they drive off he tells her about his "unpleasant" encounter with the sick woman, and is surprised when Lidia dismisses the incident. They drive to a party celebrating Giovanni's new book, which has been well received. Giovanni signs books while his wife looks on from a distance. After awhile Lidia leaves, still shaken by Tommaso's dire condition. She wanders the streets of Milan, ending up in the neighborhood where she and Giovanni lived as newlyweds. She comes across a brutal street fight which she tries to stop, and later she watches rockets being set off in a field. Back at the apartment Giovanni finally hears from Lidia and he picks her up from the old neighborhood which seems to have little sentimental value for him. Later they decide to go to a nightclub where they watch a mesmerising and seductive performance by a female dancer, and engage in small talk. "I no longer have inspirations, only recollections," Giovanni tells his wife. Lidia suggests that they leave the club and attend a swanky party thrown by a millionaire businessman. "One must do something," she says. At the party, Giovanni socialises with the guests and appears to be in his element, while Lidia walks around in a state of boredom. They spend some time with the host, Mr. Gherardini , who seems disappointed by his wealth. They exchange insincere flattery. Giovanni wanders off and meets Valentina Gherardini , the lively, charming daughter of the host. As they flirt, she teaches him a game she just invented involving sliding a compact across the floor, and soon others gather to watch their competition. Later they see each alone and Giovanni makes a pass at her, kissing her while Lidia looks on from the floor above. Later Mr. Gherardini meets privately with Giovanni and offers him an executive position with his company to write the history of his company. Giovanni is reluctant to accept, but leaves the offer open. With Lidia's family's wealth and his own earnings from publishing, he doesn't need the money. Meanwhile Lidia calls the hospital and learns that their friend Tommaso died ten minutes earlier. Overwelmed with grief, she watches from a window the guests enjoying themselves. Later she sits at a table alone opposite an empty chair. Giovanni walks over and does not sit down, and Lidia does not tell him about Tommaso's death. Giovanni sees Valentina and follows after her, leaving Lidia alone. Lidia walks to the band and appears to enjoy the music. A man named Roberto  who had been following her approaches and asks her to dance, and she accepts. A sudden rain shower, however, sends the guests running for cover, with some jumping in the pool like children. As Lidia is about to jump in from the diving board, Roberto stops her, takes her to his car, and they drive off together. She enjoys Roberto's company and their conversation, but as he's about to kiss her, Lidia turns away from him, saying, "I'm sorry, I can't." Back at the party Giovanni searches through the crowd and finds Valentina alone watching the rain. She tells him she's smart enough not to break up a marriage, and instructs him to spend the rest of the evening with his wife. Giovanni reveals that he's going through a "crisis" common among writers, but in his case it is affecting his whole life. They return to the guests, just as Lidia and Roberto return from their drive. Giovanni seems slightly annoyed by Lidia's behavior. Valentina invites Lidia to dry off in her room, where Lidia confronts her directly about her husband. As the women chat, Giovanni overhears his wife tell Valentina that she feels like dying and putting an end to the agony of her life. Noticing Giovanni she tells him that she is not a bit jealous of his playing around with Valentina. They say goodbye to Valentina and leave the party at morning's first light with the jazz band still playing for the few couples still listening. As Giovanni and Lidia walk away across Gherardini's private golf course, they talk about the job offer that Giovanni says he'll turn down. Lidia finally tells him about Tommaso's death, and recounts how Tommaso used to support her and offer his affections to her, but she eventually chose Giovanni because she loved him. She tells him, "I feel like dying because I no longer love you." Giovanni recognizes the failure of their marriage, but tells her, "Let's try to hold onto something we're sure of. I love you. I'm sure I'm still in love with you." Lidia takes out a love letter Giovanni wrote to her just before they were married and reads it aloud. Giovanni asks who wrote it, and she says, "You did." Giovanni embraces and kisses her, but she resists saying she no longer loves him, and neither does he love her. Unable to acknowledge his own failure, Giovanni continues to make love to her in a sandtrap on a golf course beneath a gray morning sky.
