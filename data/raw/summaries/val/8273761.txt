The film revisits classic characters like Hermey the Elf  and Rudolph, who is now famous at the Arctic tundra. Not satisfied with being a "freak show" performing tricks with his nose, he tags along when Hermey travels to the Island of Misfit Toys to give King Moonracer  a root canal. A storm sends Rudolph and Hermey to Castaway Cove where Rudolph considers having his nose made more normal-looking by Queen Camilla. Meanwhile The Evil Toy Taker is stealing all of the toys from the island, claiming that he's saving them from the inevitable fact that children eventually outgrow their toys and throw them out. It's up to Rudolph, Clarice, Hermey, Yukon Cornelius, and the Abominable Snow Monster to stop him.
