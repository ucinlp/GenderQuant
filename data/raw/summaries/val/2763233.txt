Three prisoners escape from a chain gang, and two of them, Wayne and Harry  run away to Happy, Texas, where they pose as the gay organizers of a beauty pageant. They put on a show with the small girls of the town while hiding from the law and waiting for the opportunity to rob the local bank. Their scheme is complicated by the fact that the local sheriff  is gay, and, believing that Wayne and Harry are also gay, he is attracted to Harry.
