Matthias Clausen is the powerful leader of Clausen Works, an old and prosperous munitions firm. He falls in love with a secretary in the office, and his children conspire against him in order to protect their inheritance. Clausen disowns them and bestows the firm on the state, confident that one of his workers capable of carrying on his work will arise.
