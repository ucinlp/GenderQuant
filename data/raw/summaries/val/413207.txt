Finally caught by the police for a huge speed infraction, he is forced to help Émilien , a down-on-his-luck police inspector, on the trail of German bank robbers. Trying to juggle a budding relationship with his beautiful girlfriend Lilly  and a need for high-speed chases, Daniel helps Émilien so that he does not lose his license and quite possibly his job.
