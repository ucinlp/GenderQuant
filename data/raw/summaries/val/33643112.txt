In the late 1920s, a little girl named Lin Yingzi of 6 years old lived on a hutong in the south of Beijing with her family. Her first friend was a mad woman Xiu Zhen who was always standing at the hutong entrance waiting for her missing daughter Xiao Guizi. Xiu Zhen fell in love with a young man in college. However, the young man was arrested before she gave birth to their daughter who was later abandoned by her family. Yingzi showed great sympathy for Xiu Zhen. Accidentally, it turned out that Yingzi’s friend Niuniu happened to be the daughter of Xiu Zhen. Xiu was so excited that she couldn’t wait to take her daughter to her father in prison. But unfortunately, they both died under a train. Afterwards, Yingzi and her family moved to another hutong. She made friend with a young man with thick lips who had to be a thief in order to support his little brother. Yingzi thought the young man was kind but was still not sure whether he was a good guy. Finally, he was arrested by the police, which made Yingzi quite sad. When Yingzi was 9 years old, the husband of her nurse came to her family. According to this man, his son has been dead and his daughter was sold to others two years ago. Yingzi got very sad grieved about this and couldn’t understand why her nurse went out to earn money instead of taking care of her own kids at home. Finally, Yingzi’s dad died of phthisis. With a number of doubts, Yingzi left with her family and said goodbye to her childhood.
