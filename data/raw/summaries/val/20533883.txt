Philbert, a large, hungry tomcat, sees Woody and gives chase. Up and down a tree, over rooftops, down a chimney, out a window and over a fence goes Woody, with the tomcat in close pursuit Finally, the tomcat catches Woody and gets ready for a good meal when suddenly, he's stunned by a sharp blow on the head. Dizzily turning, he sees Humane Officer Willoughby holding a newspaper, the caption of which reads "New law protects woodpecker from cats." The humane officer makes the tomcat tell Woody that he's sorry, and that he won't bother Woody any more. The tomcat pats Woody on the head and treats him tenderly until the humane officer moves out of sight. With the humane officer gone, the tomcat starts after Woody, who's cornered. The humane officer shows up again at the opportune moment to protect Woody. Finally, Woody enters a dog pound, with the tomcat close behind. In the battle that ensues, the tomcat jumps a fence and falls into a large trash can. Woody ties a rope to the can and then attaches the other end of the rope to an outer-space missile, which zooms to Mars as Woody and the humane officer watch it disappear into space through a telescope.
