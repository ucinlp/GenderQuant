Alä is a lecturer of Arabic literature who shares his drinking sprees with poets from the past. This time he has chosen "The Epistle of Mercy", written by El Mâari more than a 1000 years ago. He recites passages, relives the poet’s entrance to Heaven with the servant, whom he takes for an houri. Enveloped by the fumes of alcohol the bar owner becomes the devil with whom he holds a verbal duel.
