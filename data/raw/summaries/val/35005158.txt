Between 1960 and 1966, France carried out four atmospheric nuclear tests and another thirteen underground ones to the south of Reggane . The first was called Blue Jerboa and was four times as powerful as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. For the first time, French and Tuareg survivors speak of their fight to have their illnesses recognized as such, and reveal in what the conditions the tests were carried out. Fifty years later, the French Army still refuses to acknowledge its responsibility towards the populations exposed to the radiation.
