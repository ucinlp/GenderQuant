{{Plot}} The story takes place in Torrance, California sometime in the late 1970s. A pugilistic ex-convict known as "Crump's Brother" is picked up by a local teen while hitchhiking on the freeway and informs him about two women  he intends to party with in Torrance Beach. The teen then informs his friends about the situation, but no one wishes to anger Crump's Brother by tagging along; one of them, Tack  leaves with his own agenda. The title credits introduce main characters Joe  and Hubbs , as they drive around town in their 1970s Volkswagen Type III Squareback, The "Blue Torpedo" looking for drugs and women. Hubbs is the loud, dominant member of the duo while Joe is his loyal, but far more passive friend. They come across Tack, who informs them of the girls, and they reluctantly agree to take him if he provides gas money. Their friend Crump, the gas station attendant, also tells them of the girls, and realize Tack intends to take Crump's Brother's "chicks" for himself. Hubbs decides to double-cross Tack, party with the girls, and expose Tack's deception if Crump's Brother finds out; they give Crump misleading information to keep Crump and his brother preoccupied, strand Tack at the gas station, and head for Torrance Beach. They arrive at the house and find an extremely attractive girl named Lanie  who sends them off to a liquor store for alcohol. When they return, they find the homeowner's daughter Jill, a homely misanthrope and Lanie's friend; Jill is very reluctant to have them over, but is unable to dissuade Lanie from getting drunk and taking them out to find parties. Tack, in the meantime, conscripts his nerdy friend Norm "Snot-rag" Hankey to take him to the beach. They arrive at the house and after a brief scuffle, Tack entices cooperation with news of a party in Palos Verdes, much to Joe and Hubbs' chagrin. At the house party, Muldoon , the party host, lets the girls in but shuts everyone else out. Lanie leaves following an altercation with Muldoon and drafts Joe to take her swimming in a neighbor's pool when she hears he has marijuana. The police shut down the party, and Hubbs and Jill locate Joe and Lanie next door, where they continue to party until the owner chases them out. Lanie is smitten with Hubbs' aggressive nature, much to Joe's chagrin, and the two walk upstairs for sex. Downstairs, Jill and Joe try to navigate a tenuous chemistry, but Jill storms out to the beach. Having lost their beer to the police, Tack and the others raid a liquor warehouse for beer, and head for the house. Joe and Jill partially reconcile but return to find Tack and the Guzzlers converging on the home. A fight breaks out between Joe and Tack and Jill runs inside, eventually letting Joe back in and locking the door. After getting stoned, Hubbs tells Joe he's arranged for Lanie to give him fellatio as a "birthday present." Joe finds that Lanie asleep, covers her up, and walks out; he finds Hubbs with Jill making out on the couch; Joe is upset but learns that Jill was the instigator. They are interrupted when Crump's Brother arrives outside and begins to break down the door. They flee to the kitchen but shortly afterwards, they hear the commotion dying out; Jill's father, Warren  has returned from a college reunion and beaten the entire crowd of kids—including Crump's Brother—to unconsciousness with great ease. He holds Joe and Hubbs hostage awaiting the arrival of the police, but eventually, a condescending lecture provokes a fight and Joe and Hubbs dramatically escape just ahead of the police. Jill, enamored with Joe, gives him her full name and geographical location  so he can look her up later. The police arrest the entire crew of drunken teenagers, and Joe and Hubbs escape in the "Blue Torpedo." Hubbs jocularly chides Joe for his apparent cowardice in moving on Lanie and Jill, and dismisses Jill as a viable partner. Joe, no longer tolerant of Hubb's attitude, wrestles a surprised Hubbs into submission while driving and forces him to capitulate that Jill is "cool." Joe then places the Blue Öyster Cult 8-track tape into the deck and plays "Don't Fear the Reaper." The song plays as the Blue Torpedo drives off through the night. Following the credits, Joe and Hubbs are offered Blue Öyster Cult concert t-shirts outside a convenience store by two men, but Joe refuses because the shirts are bootlegs, and not official. The scalpers are played by actual Blue Öyster Cult band members Eric Bloom and Donald "Buck Dharma" Roeser.
