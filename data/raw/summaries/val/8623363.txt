The movie starts with Nicole Lauker saying good-bye to her husband as he and his friend leave to go fishing for three days. As the night comes, the door-bell rings and Nicole answers. It is the police. They say that the boat has been crashed by a bomb and Evan  is dead. They believe the death was contrived and suspect that Evan was possibly dealing with illegal substances, drugs. Nicole is devastated and refuses to believe that her husband has any connection with drugs. That night she gets a call from somebody that was going to go with Evan on the trip but was delayed. He tells her to find "the money" or the men Evan betrayed will kill her, too. As she is searching for the money, she finds an envelope to an address in Detroit. She goes to her friend's house and makes her friend dress like her so the suspicious FBI will follow her while Nicole goes to find the man at the address. When she gets there, she discovers that Evan was cheating on her with a woman named Zoe, who has an exact replica of a bird statue that Evan gave her for an anniversary. Set on finding Evan, Nicole, Zoe, and Zoe's friend Mac go to the art museum where the statue was bought from and find that Evan is alive, living under another name and address. They go to his house, he kidnaps them, and takes them on his boat. When Evan tries to kill Zoe, Nicole shoots him with a harpoon.
