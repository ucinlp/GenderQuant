The girls burn their school to the ground, and subsequently manage to get acquitted at the Old Bailey by a judge keen on leggy blonde Rosalie . They are freed, however, when Professor Canford of the University of Bagdad  claims he can rehabilitate the girls with the tutelage of teacher Miss Harker-Packer , and requests they be placed in his custody for a probationary period. Canford’s real scheme is not so benevolent, and he has ulterior motives for sending the St. Trinian’s Sixth Form girls, along with Flash Harry  and police Sgt. Ruby Gates , on a bogus cultural tour of the Greek Islands aboard a luxury yacht. Canford and Alphonse O'Reilly  intend to take the girls to a Middle Eastern harem as wives for a sheik and his many sons. O’Reilly discovers Canford, Gates and Flash Harry hiding under a lifeboat tarpaulin, and without their knowledge sets the boat adrift at sea. All three end up stranded on a deserted island. They arrive at the sheik's palace and the sons try to have their pick. But the kidnapped girls fight back in a madcap climactic brawl when the Fourth Form comes to the rescue, burning down the new school.
