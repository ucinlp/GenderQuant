On a train bound for lawless northern China, businessman Gordon Creed  encounters acquaintance Myron Galt and his attractive daughter Lola . Galt is on his way to foreclose on a very promising oilfield built up by Jim Hallet . Creed, on the other hand, wants to offer Hallet enough money to pay off his loan from Galt . Creed is annoyed when his reserved compartment is appropriated by General Chow Fu-Shan . The general is on his way to deal with self-styled General Wu Yen Fang , a warlord who has taken control of a province. However, Chow Fu-Shan is assassinated on the train by one of Fang's men. After being questioned by military governor General Ma, the three travel by horse to a remote town, where they find not only Hallet , but Creed's estranged wife Jane , who is working for missionary Dr. Abernathy. Then, Fang's subordinate, Captain Kung Nui  and his men take over the town. When Kung Nui casts his eyes on Jane, Hallet impulsively punches him. Jane and Hallet have fallen in love, though she does not believe in divorce and has kept their relationship strictly platonic. Hallet is knocked out and imprisoned. When Fang arrives, he tries to persuade Jane to go with him, promising she would enjoy it . Hallet escapes with the help of an associate disguised as one of Fang's soldiers, and sends him to notify General Ma of Fang's whereabouts. Hallet then breaks in on Fang and Jane's private discussion. Fortunately for Hallet, Fang remembers him. Hallet once hid a coolie and dug three bullets out of his shoulder; that was Fang before his meteoric rise. The warlord decides to help his benefactor. Fang robs Creed of $50,000, uses it to pay Galt what Hallet owes, then takes the money and offers it to Dr. Abernathy. Creed bribes Captain Kung Nui to rebel against Fang. Kung Nui wants to regain face by having Hallet executed. Fang pretends to give in, but just before a firing squad shoots the oilman, Fang has his right hand man, Mr. Cheng , kill Kung Nui. Afterward, Fang personally shoots Creed to fix Hallet's romantic problem, but only manages to wound him. Government troops arrive and force their way into the town. In the confusion, Jane, accompanied by Hallet, goes to attend to her husband's wound. Creed produces a gun and announces that Hallet is going to have a fatal accident, but is killed by Fang. With the battle lost, Fang decides to surrender rather than risk the lives of his captives by fighting to the end. He is taken out and shot.
