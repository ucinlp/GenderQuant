A young boy loses his mother in a car accident caused by Thakur Vikram Singh's  driver.Vikram Singh is horrified by this event and adopts the boy Raju. While his daughter, Poonam, is rather pleased by this addition to the family, his son, Maan, is less than impressed and makes his dislike of Raju very, very obvious.In the end, Vikram Singh being exasperated by his son's behaviour sends him off to boarding school. Vikram Singh also has a brother Pratrap Singh , who spends too much money on wine and women. Vikram Singh fed up with Prathap's behaviour threatens to stop supporting him. Soon Pratrap smothers him with a pillow, hoping to get away with it as Vikram was known to be a heart patient. Unfortunately he wasn't quite as unobserved as he believed himself to be.Vikram Singh's sudden death makes Raju' life miserable. Raju is treated as a servant. Pratrap Singh shares his nephew's dislike of Raju, even though he doesn't know that Raju saw him killing his brother.Raju is used as a stool when Maan goes out riding. In these stressful times, the only friend for Raju is an elder Khan . Years pass, Maan Singh grows up to be Danny Denzongpa, Raju grows up to be Rajesh Khanna, and Poonam grows up to be Salma Agha.Maan Singh continues to treat Raju badly but Khan is kind to Raju.Raju says that its his love for Poonam that has kept him there, and he won't leave as long as she loves him. His fond childhood reminiscences leads us to the first song Dil Kya Chahe.One day, Poonam insists on riding a horse which hasn't yet been broken in properly, with predictable consequences and Raju rescues her. Unluckily, the two are observed by Maan Singh, who takes his anger out on Raju and gives him a thorough beating.Meanwhile one dancing girls is very interested in uncle Pratap and would like to elope with him; but he stalls her by saying that he first needs to embezzle more of his nephew's money. Meanwhile, Poonam has taken some flowers to the injured Raju, who is even more smitten with her after this. Then Maan Singh's fiance, Sonia  visits the mansion. Sonia dresses in western clothes but appears to be a nice girl, and gets concerned about Raju who has a high fever. This worries Poonam and she goes to look after Raju. Then Poonam is bitten by a snake. Raju sucks out the poison and carries her to the main house; where he is beaten again for daring to touch Poonam. Sonia stands up for him and points out that normal people would thank him for what he did, and she also takes some medication to him to counteract the poison he inadvertendly swallowed.After Raju recovers, he goes to see how Poonam is and declares his love for her.Days pass and they are spotted by Maan, who is just prevented by his uncle from shooting Raju there and then. But Mann beats Raju in the stable.When Poonam finds the injured Raju, she dips her hand in his blood and confronts her brother. Again Maan makes next attempt to kill Raju is by throwing Raju to the dogs. In one of the confrontations Raju mentions that he knows that Pratap Singh killed his brother. Poonam realises that it is very likely that her brother will one day succeed in killing Raju, something she would rather avoid if at all possible. As Raju is staying because of their mutual love for each other, she decides that the way forward is to tell him that she doesn't love him. She does this and a heart-broken Raju leaves to the strains of a sad song Tera Ghar Teri Galiyan. Alas, Pratap Singh doesn't want an eye-witness to his dastardly dead alive, so he tries to kill Raju but leaves Raju for dead, but Raju manages to stay alive, and he is picked up by hunting party. When Raju wakes up he finds himself at the house of an older gentleman who very eagerly enquires about Raju's family. It turns out that Raju is actually this gentleman's grandson. The old man had threw his son out of the house after he married a lady from a poor family but later regretted his actions and has been looking for them for years. Now that it has turned out the Raju actually is from a wealthy family, Raju plots revenge. The instrument of this is Mubarak Ali , an employee of Raju's grandfather, who makes Maan Singh a profitable business offer, which he gladly accepts as he is feeling the pinch somewhat financially, what with all the wine, women and horse-racing, as well as an embezzling uncle. Mubarak Ali says that he works for a very wealthy businessmen. When the aforementioned businessman finally deigns to meet Maan Singh and his family there is a gallery of shocked looks as he looks just like Raju. A suggestion that he looks similar to a servant, however, almost makes Rai Bahadur Rajev Singh, walk out in a huff. However, good relations are restored though Rajev never seems to warm completely to his host, who are still a bit suspicious about the fascinating similarity. The secret is revealed to the one person who always cared about Raju and who Raju still cares for, Khan. Back with the rich people, Raju causes more confusion for Poonam by flirting with Sonia, sending her flowers and generally paying a lot of attention to her. Suspicions are further aroused and the tension heightened when Pratrap finds himself in an unfortunate incident with some horses and several metres of rope. Maan Singh starts losing money on the share market, taking the advice of Mubarak Ali and Raju. What will happen next? Who will win the race? Will Raju succeed in ruining Maan Singh? Will Sonia desert her fiance? Will Poonam get a chance to explain why she told Raju that she doesn't love him? Will Maan Singh survive?
