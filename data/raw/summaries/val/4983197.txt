Madhavan and his three friends, Charlie, Vyapuri and Venu, have a music troupe that sing at weddings. They are tenants of Manivannan whose daughter Sneha shares a good rapport with the youth, helping them in their time of need. Her encouragement puts a new zeal in Madhavan, who soon gains recognition as a singer. Not that this brings any change in the life style of the group, for the director still shows them as strugglers. Madhavan finally proposes to Sneha who rejects him, as she has her past to reckon with. She is a divorcee, her husband having abandoned her soon after marriage for his girlfriend. When friend and neighbour Ashwini puts some sense into Sneha, she decides to make amends. Incidentally, Ashwini had been hovering in the background doing almost nothing until she gets this scene to justify her presence in the film. But misunderstandings pile up between the lovers - the situations are all forced here - till the director leads the story to a desired happy ending.
