The story follows Simran , a young woman married to Sudhir  a workaholic. Due to her lonely married life, she gets into an affair with her college love, Sunny , whom she accidentally meets. She starts telling lies to Sudhir so as to meet Sunny daily. She gets so engrossed in their affair that she forgets all her commitments as a wife and mother, and she realises that it is grossly wrong. She decides to end the affair but, to her surprise, she finds another woman named Radhika with him. Simran then realises the mistake of sleeping with Sunny just because of unhappy marital life. She laments her unfaithful act. On the other hand, Sudhir hires a detective and learns about the affair and that Sunny is a womaniser. The next day, Sunny suddenly goes missing. The police come to their house and inquire about the missing Sunny, on a report registered by his girlfriend. Simran gets an idea that it has something to do with Sudhir. It is revealed that when Sudhir went to Sunny to ask him to end the affair, in the heat of the moment, he beat him brutally and buried his dead body. She accepts her mistake, supports Sudhir, and even tries to take every risk and blame on herself. This develops and strengthens their love and faith. With Sunny murdered, she is arrested by the police and she pleads guilty. Sudhir claims that it is actually he who has killed Sunny. This confuses the police. Moreover, the dead body is missing from the spot. The story takes a u-turn when it is found that this "murder" never took place; rather it was a plot planned by Sunny with the aid of Radhika to separate Simran and Sudhir, so that he could continue his love affair with Simran. But only Simran comes to realize this, and she is then trapped by Sunny. She is then rescued by her husband Sudhir who breaks into the house, and beats Sunny. Before Sunny goes, he tells Sudhir that if he dies, both of them would go to jail, and therefore Sudhir walks away. Sunny runs up behind Sudhir with a shovel but is then shot at the back by a police officer. The couple reunites with the love developed on the strong foundations of the test of mutual support and understanding to lead a happily married life.
