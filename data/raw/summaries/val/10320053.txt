They fall in love - Sundaralingam with Janaki ([[Rambha  and Ramalingam with Sundari . Both are students of art. Janaki's father, played by the music director M. S. Viswanathan, rejects Sundaralingam. Sundari convinces Janaki to write letters falsifying Sundaralingam's rise to fame and big money, eventually lying that Janaki & Sundaralingam now have a son, in order to win over the parents with sentiment. Janaki's dad, worried that his grandson might be brought up poorly, arrives at a mansion that has been set up to look like Sundaralingam's new property, along with her mom . Meanwhile, Sundari's dad  also makes an unexpected stop there to check on his daughter. A small misunderstanding during introductions and progressively bigger lies to cover the initial lies lead to a side-splitting laugh riot. How those four eventually overcome their problems and find happiness forms the rest of the story.
