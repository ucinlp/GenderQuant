Emotionally uprooted after the recent death of her husband, Esther Kern  is trying to return to normal life after completing her shiva—a weeklong period of family mourning mandated in the Jewish religion.Wilson, Ken. "Austinite returns from Cannes Film Festival". KEYE-TV. June 7, 2009. Mrs. Kern's children—a successful ophthalmologist and the wife of a busy businessman—have long since moved away to start families of their own, setting aside the traditions of the Jewish faith which she so cherishes for the concerns of daily life.

But unsure of what to make of this unexpected situation, the repairman is at once taken aback and drawn in by the residue of the tragedy that lingers in the home."Austin, Texas Writer / Director Craig Whitney Talks About His Short Film “Harvest Home” and His Journey To the Cannes Film Festival".
