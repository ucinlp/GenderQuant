An offer for a trip to see the pyramids in Egypt is shown. The tour then proceeds to leave with a large caravan of camels being used as transportation. Porky then comes running out and chases after the caravan; but he is too late and ends up not being able to catch up to them. He sees an available camel however, and takes it with the intent of seeing the pyramids, but he ends up lost in the desert and eventually him and weirdly enough, the camel start to suffer from dehydration. They start seeing various mirages that cause them to go into a dreamlike sequence where Porky and the camel both hallucinate and hear strange voices. The camel then starts acting weird and Porky tries to calm him down, but fails, and the camel grows more and more insane. Eventually, they run screaming from the desert and back into the town and get into a safehouse; at which point Porky starts doing the same erratic behavior the camel did earlier in the cartoon. The cartoon ends at this point as the camel looks on at Porky.
