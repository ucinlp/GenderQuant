Betty , a young alcoholic woman, is caught cold while cheating on her bourgeois husband. Wasting no time, he and his family arrange a quick divorce settlement, ousting her from home and keeping her away from the two children the couple have. One night she ends up in a restaurant called Le Trou , where she meets Laure , an older woman, an alcoholic herself. Laure decides to take care of Betty after hearing the heart-breaking stories of her being a victim of a rich and ruthless society. Betty receives care and friendship from Laure, who's in a relationship with Mario , the restaurant's owner. The envy toward Laure for Mario grows each day and will drive Betty to artfully contrive the means to conquer her new friend's lover. Laure realizes she has made a mistake by trusting her new friend and things soon begin to tremble between them. Betty's true colors are now visible and she sees her life at a point of no return, as she selfishly stomped on the last chance she had been given to be a better person.<ref nameAt The Movies|publisher http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/27/movies/at-the-movies.html|author27 December 1991}}
