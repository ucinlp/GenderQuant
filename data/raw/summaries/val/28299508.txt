The film begins with Commander Bolton and a few surviving crew members of his 50-man submarine Gauntlet swimming ashore after unsuccessfully attacking German battleship Lindendorf. After a review, Captain Bolton is cleared of any wrongdoing and placed in charge of a small group of experimental X class submarines. His mission is to quickly train crews to man the submarines and sink the Lindendorf while it is hidden away in a Norwegian fiord. The film progresses with Commander Bolton training the crews of the three submarines. He must overcome tensions with some of his former crew members, while keeping their activities hidden from outsiders and German planes. The crews successfully fend off an attack by German commandos, who discover their base. Bolton is forced to make hasty preparations for his attack before their submarine base can be destroyed. Two of the submarines are lost while attempting to cut through submarine nets at the entrance to the fiord. One submarine crew is captured and taken to the German battleship for interrogation. The surviving submarine penetrates the submarine nets in the fiord and places explosives under the German battleship. The submarine then manages to escape as the battleship explodes. The film concludes as the battleship sinks.
