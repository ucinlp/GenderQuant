The setting of the film is an airfield called RAF Halfpenny Field . The action takes place in 1940, 1942, and 1944. Pilot Officer Peter Penrose  is posted in the summer of 1940 as a pilot to  No 720 Squadron,There were two units by that name during the Second World War: No 720 Squadron RAF was a non-flying, airfield defence unit of the RAF Regiment. The only British flying unit known as 720 Squadron was a Fleet Air Arm squadron; during the war it was a flying boat unit attached to the Royal New Zealand Navy. at a new airfield, RAF Station Halfpenny Field, as a very green "15 hour sprog" Bristol Blenheim pilot, and is assigned to B Flight, under Flight Lieutenant David Archdale . When No 720 Sqn's commanding officer, Squadron Leader Carter  is shot down, Archdale takes over. Whilst Penrose develops into a first-class pilot, he meets Iris Winterton , a young woman staying with her domineering aunt at the Golden Lion pub in the nearby village. Archdale marries Miss Todd , the popular manageress of the hotel, who is known to everyone as "Toddy". The Archdales later have a son, Peter. The action flashes forward to May 1942 when No 720 Sqn is now flying Douglas Bostons. When Penrose shows signs of strain from extensive combat, Archdale has him posted to controller school, but is himself shot down and killed over France on Penrose's last mission. Penrose had been courting Iris, despite her aunt's disapproval, but Archdale's fate weighs heavily on his mind. Not wanting Iris to suffer if the same happened to him, he stops seeing her. No 720 Sqn is sent to the Middle East, but Penrose remains behind as a ground controller for a United States Army Air Forces B-17 Flying Fortress bombardment group, which takes over the airfield. Despite cultural differences, Penrose befriends USAAF Captain Johnny Hollis  and Lieutenant Joe Friselli . On 17 August 1942 the American airmen participate in the first attack by the USAAF on Occupied France, ruefully acknowledging that they underestimated the difficulties involved. Afterwards, Penrose is posted to flying duties with an RAF Avro Lancaster bomber unit . In 1944 Penrose, now a Squadron Leader and pathfinder pilot, makes an emergency landing at Halfpenny Field, where he meets Iris again. Iris had decided to leave her aunt for good and join up. Toddy persuades a still reluctant Penrose to propose to Iris, saying that she did not regret her own marriage in spite of her husband's death. Hollis, who has formed a platonic relationship with Toddy, is killed while crash-landing a damaged returning bomber, rather than bail out and risk it crashing in the village.
