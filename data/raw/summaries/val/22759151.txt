The film starts with a faux preview for a non-existent movie, The Magnificent Five Plus One, which promotes cosmonauts Sergey Volkov, Yuri Lonchakov, Oleg Kononenko, and astronauts Michael Fincke and Greg Chamitoff as the stars of the never-to-be-made film. Richard Garriott is billed as 'The Gunfight Participant' â€“ a satirical nod to his official status as a 'Spaceflight Participant.' These six were all the crew aboard the International Space Station during Garriott's time aboard. After this preview, the film proper begins. A series of motion graphics under the credits leads us to a Soyuz spacecraft departing the International Space Station, bearing Garriott, Volkov, and Kononenko back to earth. Finke and Chamitoff wave goodbye but express their relief at Garriott's leaving as he was annoying them with his constant talk of computer games. Lonchakov insists that they all go back to work. One week later, Chamitoff and Fincke are both missing Garriott. Chamitoff could no longer juggle without Garriott, and Fincke knew Garriott was good at settling arguments about which of them was standing upside down. At this point Lonchakov points out that the oxygen use aboard the station is too high. Everyone theorizes wildly about the cause which universally involve interstellar aliens invading the station. A search of ridiculous locations on the station ensues during which the surprising nature of the alien is discovered. The completed film is just over eight minutes in length. It includes numerous references to classic science-fiction movies including The Day the Earth Stood Still, Forbidden Planet and Galaxy Quest.
