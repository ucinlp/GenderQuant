Lucio  is a unemployed thirty year old red-haired guy who's extremely lazy and doesn't wake up until three o'clock in the afternoon; he treats his parents very poorly and always hang out at the nearest bar, expecially with his best friend Pino , who's also unemployed and equally weird . One day, as Lucio's sister leaves for the US, he's convinced by their parents to substitute her at the private hospital where she used to work, which is directed by the charming Fatima Turchini.
