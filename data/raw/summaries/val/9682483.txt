Detective-Sergeant Johnson  has been a police officer for 20 years, and is deeply affected by the murders, rapes, and other violent crimes he has investigated. His anger surfaces while interrogating a man named Baxter , who had been picked up by police that night, as they searched the town for a child molester; by the end of the interrogation, Johnson has beaten him to death. Johnson is suspended and returns home for the night, and gets into a violent argument with his wife, Maureen . The following day, Johnson is interrogated by Detective Superintendent Cartwright , and during the long interrogation flashbacks show the events during the night when Johnson killed Baxter. During the interrogation, Baxter &mdash; whose guilt or innocence is left ambiguous &mdash; had begun taunting Johnson, insinuating that Johnson secretly wanted to commit the sort of sex crimes he investigated. Johnson at first flew into a rage and struck Baxter, but he eventually admitted that he did indeed harbor obsessive fantasies of murder and rape, and that he was losing his mind under the strain. He then tearfully begged Baxter to help him; when Baxter recoiled from him in disgust, Johnson snapped and killed him. The film ends with another flashback, this time of Johnson attacking the police officers who pulled him off of Baxter, and muttering, "God...my God..." as he realizes what he has done.
