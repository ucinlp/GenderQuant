A mysterious group of ninja called the Sora from the Sky Country makes a surprise attack on Konoha for vengeance due to Konoha nearly destroying the Sky Country during the last Shinobi World War. At the same time Naruto, Sakura, and Hinata are sent along to help a boy's village. They accompany Amaru, the boy, and Shinnō, his sensei, back to the village. Later Naruto notices that Amaru is in fact a female due to her falling into the water for her scapel. Meanwhile at Konoha, the Sora-nin retreat with their dwindling chakra supply. Tsunade sends another special team consisting of Kakashi, Shikamaru, Sai and Shino to look for their base and later on as the movie progresses Sai and Shino successfully destroy the ships which the sky ninja are stationed and thus leaving Konoha  victorious. At Orochimaru's lair, Orochimaru is now ill because the body transfer jutsu he uses is close to expiration. Orochimaru orders Sasuke to get a man who is able to help him perfect his reincarnation jutsu. Naruto and company reach Amaru's village and finds the village in ruins and its inhabitants missing. Amaru triggers a trap while searching for the villagers but Shinnō protects her and dies in the process. After Amaru comes to her senses they continue to look for villagers. Later on Hinata becomes separated from Sakura and Naruto. Naruto and Sakura later find themselves in front of an evil monster called Zero Tails, a being that feeds on the darkness of human souls and had somehow possessed Amaru. Sakura proves to be no match for the beast; the creature senses that Naruto has a huge dark energy/power inside of him so it taunts Naruto and tries to make him use that power causing him to take on the Nine Tailed Fox chakra and, eventually, goes into four-tails state. The present Sakura gave Naruto from Jiraiya contained a seal, which suppressed the Nine Tailed Fox chakra, allowing Naruto to take over. Naruto tells Amaru to ignore the darkness in her heart which finally results in the beast getting defeated. Eventually they decided to separate; Naruto going on to look for the villagers and Hinata with Sakura returning to Konoha for help. Amaru, who was supposed to go with Sakura stays to help Naruto. Immediately, the ruins rise from the ground to reveal Ancor Vantian, a floating fortress. They decide to search in some ruins and find Shinnō alive. Amaru, excited that her sensei is alive runs to hug him, but Naruto notices something is not right and Shinnō laughs at Amaru for trusting him. Shinnō mentions that he's been researching the power of darkness for about 15 years and he's finally found it in Konoha, a secret scroll. He then transforms into a powered-up form and fights with Naruto, overwhelming Naruto with his Revival technique. Amaru reminisces about her past. When she was small, she suffered from a strange illness. No one tried to help her, fearing that they would be infected. Only Shinnō cared for her and managed to cure her. She admits her love to Shinnō, distracting him, allowing Naruto to land an attack. Naruto prepares to finish Shinnō off with Rasengan when Sasuke appears and intervenes Naruto's attack with Chidori. Sasuke tells Shinnō that Orochimaru needed help with the reincarnation jutsu. At first Shinnō refuses to cooperate and tries to defeat Sasuke until he collapses and all his power and muscle drain away. Sasuke reveals that he had attacked Shinno minutes earlier with Chidori Senbon at his vital chakra points to cut off his chakra flow. Shinnō gives Sasuke the scroll to perfect the reincarnation jutsu and leaves via a trap door. Sasuke leaves and is pursued by Naruto and end up in a room with a giant cocoon which is absorbing dark chakra. Shinnō reveals the cocoon to be Zero Tails. He then fuses with the cocoon and transforms into a monster. Shinnō captures them and starts to absorb their chakra; Sasuke releases the curse seal and Naruto releases the Nine Tailed Fox chakra, overloading him and freeing them from his grasp. Then they defeat him. Shinnō reveals that now Reibi is now unleashed, whose energy starts to overtake the fortress. In the meantime Konoha successfully infiltrates and destroys the Sora-ninja's base. Amaru finds the villagers and Hinata in a cell and frees them all. Naruto appears again and orders Amaru to leave the ruins while he remains there to destroy it. Amaru refuses but is forced to leave by Sasuke. Naruto thanks Sasuke before using Rasengan to send Sasuke away also, saying a silent goodbye. Naruto then proceeds destroying the ruins sending him in a freefall. Amaru, from a distance sees Naruto and grabs a pair of sora-ninja wings and tries to save him. Upon reaching him, she grabs him and they fall together. Jiraiya suddenly appears out with Gamabunta and catches the two, saving them. Sasuke returns and gives Orochimaru the scroll. Sasuke later thinks of Naruto's goodbye to him: "I will definitely bring you back to Konoha, Sasuke".
