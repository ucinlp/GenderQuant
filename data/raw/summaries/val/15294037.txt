A scientist named Eiji has developed a new chemical called 'MySon' that can turn pain into pleasure. He decides to put three girls who attend the experiment held by Eiji's mother in the test. Meanwhile, Eiji has a crush on one of the girls, Rika. 'MySon' influences the girls gradually. The gluttonous woman wishes to have the best food in the world, but she ends up eating herself. The vain woman wishes to have the thinnest and most beautiful body in the world. However, noticing hairs and pores all over her body, she tries to mutilate herself. Rika does not seem to be influenced by 'MySon', but Eiji finds out her secret and everything goes wrong... The film's most controversial scene features the gluttonous woman first eating her labia, then her nipple, and finally her eyeball. Eiji's mother is frequently visited by his father. Eventually, he pulls open her abdomen and climbs inside.
