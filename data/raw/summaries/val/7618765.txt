The story concerns a young scientist, Dr. Allen Barnes , who obtains a mysterious ancient tribal mask. Whenever he puts on the mask, Barnes experiences dream-like visions which become increasingly disturbing and violent. The visions begin to alter Barnes' personality, and eventually drive him insane.  The Mask is notable chiefly for its surreal use of 3-D cinematography. Most of the story is presented in conventional black-and-white. However, whenever Dr. Barnes is about to put on the mask, Barnes' voice  urges the viewer to "Put the mask on, NOW!" This was the cue for theatergoers to put on the red/green 3-D glasses  which they were given upon entering the theater. The terrifying visions experienced by Dr. Barnes were then presented in anaglyphic 3-D. The 3-D sequences, four in all, last only a few minutes each. They were designed by montage expert Slavko Vorkapich, and feature an array of distinctively psychedelic visuals, some of which are mildly gruesome. A crude electronic music score  enhances the strangeness of the 3-D scenes.
