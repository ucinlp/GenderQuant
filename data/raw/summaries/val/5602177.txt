Lifelong friends Deco and Naldinho share ownership of an old, rusting boat in Salvador, Brazil. A strong bond exists between the two men, transcending their racial differences. "No woman will come between us," Naldinho tells Deco, and Deco concurs: "All the women in the world couldn't come between us." That bond is tested after the men meet Karina, a dancer and prostitute. Karina needs a ride, and she offers the two men her "services" in exchange for transport on their boat and a little cash. The emotional entanglements that result from Karina's "deal" are stronger than the trio expected. Deco and Naldinho develop a desire to possess Karina. Karina's desires are more subtle, though its clear that she feels both a sisterly affection and sexual attraction toward the two men.
