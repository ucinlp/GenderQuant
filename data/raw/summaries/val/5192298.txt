A baldlive-action host  opens with a disclaimer about the nature of the cartoon, namely, that the short is meant to demonstrate that "beyond the shadow of a doubt, crime does not pay." The story begins as the victim , presumably the master of a very large mansion, is reading a book based on the very cartoon he's in. Frightened, he muses that, according to the book, he is about to be "bumped off." Someone throws a letter attached to a knife telling the master that he will die at 11:30. When he objects, another letter informs him that the time has been moved to midnight. True to form, a mysterious killer in a heavy black cloak soon shoots  him dead , and a police officer  immediately begins to investigate. After investigating the premises and the staff, the officer gives a lengthy chase to the real killer, finding the mansion to be filled with many surreal pitfalls, strange characters - including a red skeleton, a parody of Red Skelton - and booby traps that slow and obstruct him. He eventually traps the killer and unmasks him, revealing him to be the opening-sequence host who confesses, "I dood it" - one of Skelton's catchphrases - before bursting into tears.
