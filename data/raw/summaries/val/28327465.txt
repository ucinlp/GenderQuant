During a snowy night, the car of Joo-yun  gets a flat tire and Kyung-chul  drives up in a yellow school bus/van and offers to help fix her tire. Kyung-chul kills her and scatters her body parts. When a boy discovers one of Joo-yun's ears, police are called and find the rest of the body, under the command of Squad Chief Jang , who is the father of Joo-yun. Joo-yun's fianc√©, Soo-hyun , who is a secret service agent of the National Intelligence Service , becomes determined to track down and take vengeance on Joo-yun's murderer. Jang supplies Soo-hyun with a list of four potential killers, including Kyung-chul. Searching Kyung-chul's home, Soo-hyun finds jewelry and underwear that Kyung-chul has taken from  numerous victims. When he finds Joo-yun's wedding ring he knows that Kyung-chul's is the killer. Soo-hyun puts a tracking device on the school bus, tracking then attacking Kyung-chul while sexually assaulting his latest victim&mdash;one of the schoolgirls he was transporting home. Rendering him unconscious, he places an NIS transmitter inside Kyung-chul, so he can better track his location and listen to his conversations. Waking up, Kyung-chul flags down a taxi, killing the driver and passenger before going to a medical centre, where he sexually assaults a nurse, only to be again attacked by Soo-hyun. Kyung-chul goes to the home of his friend Tae-joo , a cannibalistic murderer with a freezer full of bodies. After explaining his situation, Tae-joo remarks that whoever is after him must have some relation to one of his victims. Soo-hyun arrives at the house, where he proceeds to incapacitate both murderers and Tae-joo's girlfriend Se-jung . The next day, both Tae-joo and Se-jung are found by the police and sent to a hospital. Meanwhile, a trusted subordinate of Soo-hyun's ensures he and Kyung-chul are sent to a private medical area away from the police. The barely conscious Kyung-chul hears them talk about the transmitter inside him. Soo-hyun dumps Kyung-chul, intending to continue tracking and attacking him. Kyung-chul taunts him over the transmitter, now knowing who he is and how he's being tracked. To make Soo-hyun lose track of him, Kyung-chul brutally assaults a store owner, directing Soo-hyun to rush to the aid of the victim before he dies. Kyung-chul uses this time to defecate out the transmitter and place it inside a taxi driver he viciously assaults. Soo-hyun interrogates Tae-joo and learns that Kyung-chul is going after Joo-yun's father Jang and sister Se-yun . Soo-hyun arrives too late to stop Kyung-chul, who blinds Jang with a dumbbell and murders Se-yun. He abducts Kyung-chul before he can turn himself over to the police. Soo-hyun tortures him physically and mentally before setting up a guillotine above Kyung-chul's head that is soon after activated when his parents and son arrive to visit and open the door to the room he is in. Placing a transmitter nearby, Soo-hyun's hears the death of Kyung-chul and his family's reaction to his decapitated corpse. Walking away from the house, Soo-hyun breaks down crying on the street, perhaps finally realizing that his ridiculous effort to stretch out his revenge has allowed Kyung-chul to murder three more people, sexually assault two other women, brutally assault three other men, then traumatized his family by making them 'responsible' for the guillotine death.
