George Milton  is in a train boxcar, reminiscing upon the events that have just happened. He thinks back to when he and his companion Lennie Small , who has an intellectual disability, are fleeing from their previous employment in Weed. They were run out of town after Lennie was accused of attempted rape when he touched and held onto a young woman's pretty red dress . After running from Weed, George and Lennie are trying to attain their shared dream of settling down on their own piece of land. Lennie's part of the dream, which he never tires of hearing George describe, is merely to have soft rabbits on the farm, which he can pet. The two go to work at a ranch named Tyler Ranch. At the ranch, the dream appears to move closer to reality. Candy , the aged, one-handed ranch-hand, offers to pitch in with Lennie and George so they can buy the farm. The dream disappears when Lennie accidentally kills the young and attractive wife  of Curley , the ranch owner's son, while trying to stroke her hair; as a result, a lynch mob led by Curley gathers and goes after Lennie with the intent to kill him. Realizing he is doomed to a life of loneliness and despair like the rest of the migrant workers, and wanting to spare Lennie a painful death at the hands of the vengeful and violent thug Curley, George shoots Lennie in the back of the head while distracting him with their dream of the ranch, releasing Lennie happily. George reminisces in the train boxcar, he has one final memory of him and Lennie working together and going off into the distance happily.
