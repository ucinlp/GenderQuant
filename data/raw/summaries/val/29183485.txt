Danny plays piano in 'Anthony's Cafe' every morning and evening when no one's there. He buys newspapers from a man who is homeless, because he likes the guy, just to throw them away every night. He works at the cafe with his best friend Roger. One day, he meets Ariana by waitering her table, and immediately falls in love. He gives her his number secretly, and two weeks later she comes again, and he finds out she's deaf. Their first date goes well. The second one, an interpreter is brought, but they soon ditch her to have her second 21st birthday  Danny continues to see her, despite Roger telling him that it couldn't work as she's deaf, where he replies 'I won't give up something great just because it may also be hard.' Meanwhile, the sign language interpreter stands by, unsure whether to tell Ariana's mother or not. Also, Danny is preparing for a live concert at the cafe, where he will perform some of his own songs. Ariana's mother is soon told, and she then forbids her daughter from ever seeing Danny. Her life is then strictly and largely controlled, including a man her age coming to go out with her and attempting to rape her; she stops him by kicking him in the groin. Ariana also meets and befriends Nicole, after storming out a college class  when a guy made fun of her hearing. They are soon best friends. Danny becomes worried after not seeing her for over a month. He finds out that they aren't on holiday, after being told so, and goes to her house where a third 21st birthday is being celebrated. He is forced to leave, despite him saying he'd only leave if Ariana wanted him to. She also doesn't come to his concert  and he says it is ridiculous. Not long later, Ariana and her mother go to the cafe again, just to be dragged out. She wrestles with her daughter, saying she's just 'playing up' as she screams repeatedly, until she smacks her mother hard in the face and runs off. Roger tells Danny, who goes to his apartment , only to be too late, as she was brought home. In their house, Ariana discovers all her unsent letters to Danny, and confronts her mother. The interpreter disposes of them after being ordered to, only to find a binned letter about a cochlear implant. She tells Ariana, who yells at her mother in sign about it, before the two leave. Roger and Danny are up late talking. Roger leaves the room to reasd a newspaper, and returns to find Danny having a seizure on the ground. He brings him to the hospital and when he wakes up again him, Roger and Ariana are told that he has entered the advanced stage of a primary brain tumour. There is no cure, as it always seems to return. Ariana and Roger visits him constantly as his condition becomes worse, including his retching being far more violent. He shaves his head after a shower once. However, as his mother lived with cancer for five years, never complaining and always saying 'Today is a great day to be alive,' he stays optimistic. Roger helps him out the hospital for a few hours, where Danny gives George, the man selling newspapers, all the money he had been saving up to buy a music machine to make demos. He meets up with Roger at the cafe, to find all his instruments there and the demo machine . Halfway through, he collapses, and is brought to hospital and set up in a breathing mask. He and Roger have a last talk together before Roger leaves to see when Ariana will be finished with her ear operation. Before receiving the answer, he runs back to Danny's room, who had taken his breathing mask off as soon as his best friend left. The next day, Ariana goes to visit Danny, to find him dead and Roger sobbing beside him. There is a funeral, and Ariana becomes a wreck. She is given a package, passed by Roger but written from Danny, explaining that he is staying with his mother for a while but will always love her. She continues to live a full life, hearing the world like Danny asked her to, and it ends with her walking into a music school.
