Woody and Buzz are hotel bellhops busy staring at a magazine admiring the drop dead gorgeous French actress Ga Ga Gazoo who even manages to turn the heads of men in the publication. She is shown walking her dog, skiing and wearing a one piece bikini. Their dreams come true when they discover Miss Gazoo is about to be their next hotel guest. Woody and Buzz then aggressively compete for the attractive actress's affections. She thinks Woody is cute and tries to kiss him on the lips the minute she meets him but Buzz interferes. She subsequently sics her poodle on him. Eventually, the blonde bombshell chooses Woody Woodpecker over Buzz. Woody is invited to stay in Ga Ga Gazoo's hotel room.
