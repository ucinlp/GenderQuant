 Tom wakes up after a nightmare of being turned into a nail-shape and pounded into the ground by a giant bulldog. When he sees Jerry catching a bone, he grabs him but Jerry wallops him on the head with it and runs off, stopping at a giant dog house. When Tom approaches it, he is reminded of his dream and runs off in horror. Instead, a small bulldog  comes out. When Tom grabs Jerry, the bulldog grabs his tail and rapidly eats away at Tom's fur, spinning in a blur, and pounding his head to the ground. Tom has several attempts at catching Jerry, even stuffing an oversized bone with dynamite, spraying himself with dog repellent, and lastly playing fetch with the dog by throwing a stick into a safe, and hurling the safe into a deep pit. However, every time, the minuscule pup manages to eat away at Tom, and in the final attempt, the pup manages to chew away at Tom until he is literally pieces of hair. It turns out that all this was a dream. Tom takes some medicine and playing music before going back to sleep and calmly dreaming of being pounded once again into the ground.
