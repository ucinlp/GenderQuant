The film begins by exploring stories involving a number of different characters who live in and around London, all of whom have experiences which lead them to believe that justice in the country is not being handed out fairly. These characters include white-collar worker Gene Dekker , who is violently beaten by yobs without any reason on the way to his wedding. Danny Bryant  is a paratrooper who has seen action in the Falklands, Afghanistan and Iraq and who arrives back from abroad to find his wife with someone else, and also believes that the state of the country is worse than the war-torn places he has recently served in. Crown Court prosecution barrister Cedric Munroe  receives death threats towards his pregnant wife, being told they will only be safe if he pulls out of the case against club owner and heroin dealer Terry Manning , a boss of the criminal underworld, who Munroe is currently prosecuting. Cambridge University student Sandy Mardell  and son of Bryant's former commanding officer has only recently left hospital, though the thugs who scarred him for life in an unprovoked attack were released from prison before he had made his recovery. Through the help of jingoistic hotel security guard and former football hooligan Simon Hillier , who has a connection to all the men in one form or another, the men are united - Munroe had previously defended him in court, Dekker had gone to school with him, and Bryant stays in the hotel where he works. The men form a vigilante gang, targeting individuals who they determine to be a blight on society. Information on said targets is provided to them by Munroe's police contact Walter Lewis , one of the few police officers who is not corrupt and who has been stuck behind a desk by his superiors. The men work through targets associated with Manning, whose men went ahead with their threat against Munroe's pregnant wife, killing her and their unborn child. The men use firearms Bryant stole from active duty with the army. The gang attract media attention and become known as the "Outlaws", but get themselves into trouble when they reveal their identities to one of Manning's men, Ian Furlong, yet fail to kill him. As a result Furlong kills Lewis, and Bryant, the leader of the outlaws, is subsequently framed for the murder. Following this the gang go their separate ways, though not before Bryant hangs Hillier for being a liability, questioning his authority and insulting his wife. As they all go back to their day-to-day lives, Manning is released from custody because of lack of prosecution. Bryant confronts Furlong in a pub regarding Manning's location, and shoots Furlong through the head. Dekker receives word from his friend and colleague Frank Lordish that he learned from his brother that Manning is hiding in the countryside. Dekker flees his wedding to contact Munroe when he realises that he cannot live a normal life while letting Manning get away. The pair contact Mardell, who after meeting up with Bryant, decides that they will not survive the attack on Manning's home. Bryant, Munroe and Dekker infiltrate Manning's home, yet quickly discover that it is a trap, with armed police soon arriving outside, led by the corrupt Sgt. Grieves  of the Flying Squad, who is in league with Manning. The three outlaws engage in a gunfight with the police and manage to flee into the woods for one final showdown. Dekker is shot in the shoulder and Bryant is killed while advancing towards the armed response squad and shooting at them. Munroe willingly surrenders only to be murdered by the now blatantly corrupt police officers. When it appears that all the vigilantes are dead, Dekker is revealed to still be alive and was playing dead. He successfully escapes through the forest, pursued by gunshots. The final scene shows Frank being handed an envelope of cash by Terry Manning in his workplace's car park. As the crime lord drives away he is confronted by a gun-wielding Dekker, who points the gun in Manning's face. Manning sneers at Dekker, saying "You haven't got the bollocks, son", to which Dekker continues to smile, and the film ends with Dekker pulling the trigger.
