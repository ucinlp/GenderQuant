Cynthia Glenn  is a swimming instructor in Los Angeles, California, where she lives with her scatterbrained aunt and uncle Nona and Hobart . While demonstrating a dive to her students, she catches the eye of an interested stranger, Bob Delbar . Cynthia returns home to find that she has received flowers from the stranger. The two court for one month, and then get married. They leave immediately after the wedding on their honeymoon to the hotel Monte Belva, where they encounter the famous opera singer, Nils Knudsen . Major Thomas Milvaine , who is also staying at the hotel, notices Cynthia. J.P. Bancroft, a rich colleague, calls Bob and insists that he come to Washington to complete a deal. While Cynthia cries over Bob's departure, Tommy, who is staying next door, comforts her. The next day, Cynthia ventures down to the pool, where she and J.P.Bancroft's daughter, Maude  speculate as to which hotel guest is Major Thomas Milvaine, the decorated war hero, who shot down "16... or was it 26 war planes?" and was stuck on a deserted island for a month. After Maude teases Cynthia about being at the hotel without her husband on her vacation, Cynthia performs an elaborate dive and swims around the pool, where she proceeds to run into Major Milvaine himself, who can't actually swim, so she teaches him how.  For the rest of the week, Cynthia and Tommy continue accompanying each other to dinner and other activities around the hotel, including swimming. On the last day, Cynthia receives a telegram from Bob informing her that he will not be able to come back to the hotel for another week. However, Tommy is leaving the next morning, and Cynthia is distraught, so she retires to her room. Tommy realizes he loves her, rushes to their adjoining balcony, confesses his love for her and tells her that he is planning on staying for another week. However, Cynthia reiterates that she's a married woman, therefore, she won't let him hop over the hedge separating their two balconies and make love to her. She calls Bob in Washington and begs him to return, but he tells her that he can't. Cynthia looks for Tommy the next morning, but is told that he has checked out the hotel after their conversation the previous night, so she goes for a walk on her own on the Sunset Trail. Tommy returns to the hotel, learns where Cynthia has gone, and sets off after her on the trail. Meanwhile, Bob telephones the hotel and leaves a message indicating that he will be arriving the following morning. Tommy finds Cynthia and they proceed to walk together until they come across a tree with initials engraved on it. Cynthia tells Tommy that she loves him as well, but wants to give her marriage to Bob a chance, and lets him know that once they get back to the hotel, they should say their goodbyes and never see each other again. However, on the return trip, they lose their way and are forced to spent the night in the woods. The next morning, Bob arrives and finds that his wife isn't anywhere in the hotel. When they do return, Tommy tries to explain their disappearance, while Bob realizes that the two are in love. He becomes angry with Cynthia, and announces he wants an annulment after Cynthia admits that she fell in love with Tommy. Bob calls his lawyer, he finds out that he was never actually divorced from his previous wife. Tommy leaves to become an instructor at Darwin Field, and Cynthia returns home to her aunt and uncle. Nils Knudsen  telephones Tommy, and later, the two arrive at Cynthia's house late at night with a full band and orchestra, where they serenade the Glenn house, as well as the rest of the neighborhood. Tommy lip-synches Knudsen's voice to a love song to Cynthia. The two share a kiss while Knudsen continues singing, leaving Nona and Hobart to wonder how Tommy can sing and kiss at the same time.
