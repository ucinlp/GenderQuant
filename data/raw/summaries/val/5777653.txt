In the middle of the Arabian Desert, a rich Sultan has stored all his treasure in a cave and is leaving his guard Hassan to watch the cave. As the Sultan leaves, the trail of a burrowing rabbit crosses the desert towards the cave. Hassan spots the burrow tunneling under the entrance of the cave and attempts to chase out the intruders, but has trouble remembering the command to open the door. Inside the cave, Bugs Bunny and his traveling companion Daffy Duck emerge from the burrow, believing they have arrived at Pismo Beach. Daffy's complaints are silenced when he spots the riches. Determined to keep it all for himself he stomps repeatedly on Bugs to force him back into the burrow. Meanwhile Hassan finally says the correct command to open the door and marches in. He is met by Daffy, who is wheeling a cart full of loot. Daffy asks him to call a cab. In response, Hassan brings his sword down on Daffy's head, splitting in half both the diamond-adorned hat he is wearing and a single feather underneath. Daffy flees in terror and uses a large gem to try bribing Bugs into saving him, but Bugs is only concerned with dusting himself off from the earlier abuse from Daffy. Hassan rushes towards them both, sword raised. Daffy hides and tells Hassan to chop the rabbit, but Bugs has disguised himself to be a genie in a bottle and fools Hassan with a rich offer for releasing him. Hassan does, taking no notice of Daffy's attempt to expose Bugs. Bugs tells Hassan the treasure is his to claim. Daffy sardonically mocks Bugs for allowing Hassan access to the treasure he wanted for himself. Outside the cave, Bugs surveys the desert and concludes he is in the wrong place. Suddenly Daffy runs out carrying a large gem, with the enraged Hassan in hot pursuit. Daffy begs Bugs to save him, and this time Bugs reluctantly complies while berating Daffy for his greed. He sets up an Indian rope trick behind a rock, and misleads Hassan up the rope. As Hassan disappears into the clouds, Bugs pulls the rope down. With the coast clear, Daffy runs back to the cave to claim the treasure. Some time later, Daffy has emptied the cave of treasure into an enormous cart. Looking back, he spots an old oil lamp and rubs the dust off it. A genie emerges from the lamp, but Daffy thinks the genie is after the treasure and proceeds to stomp him back into the lamp. The furious genie erupts from the lamp, declaring Daffy will suffer the 'consequences' and Bugs, unable  to save Daffy now, hurriedly escapes via burrow. Daffy dismisses his punishment as he's still rich. Much later, Bugs has finally made it to Pismo Beach and, while tucking into the area's famous clams, casually wonders how Daffy's encounter with the genie worked out. Opening one clam and discovering a pearl inside, he soon finds out; Daffy, shrunk to a few inches in height, emerges from Bugs' burrow trail in the sand and claims the pearl for his own. Bugs closes the clam on the greedy duck.
