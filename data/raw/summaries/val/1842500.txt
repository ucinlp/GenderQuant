Ross  is a customer of Spider Mike , a methamphetamine dealer. Spider Mike and his girlfriend Cookie  are constantly arguing, and Ross strikes up a friendship with Nikki , a fellow addict. Nikki takes Ross to meet her boyfriend, "The Cook" , who supplies Spider Mike with drugs from a meth lab he has set up in a motel room. The Cook gives a small amount of meth to Ross in exchange for bringing Nikki home, and says that he will get in touch with Ross if he needs a driver. Back at his apartment, Ross gets messages from his mother and his former girlfriend, Amy, wishing him a happy birthday; Amy is also demanding that he pay back $450 that he owes her. Ross, assuming she still loves him, calls her and leaves a message. He then goes to the local strip club while high, leading to an intense pornographic hallucination. He takes one of the dancers, April , home and has sex with her in a variety of positions, the last of which leaves her handcuffed and tied to the bed. As they finish, the Cook calls with an emergency regarding Nikki's dog. Ross, still high, duct-tapes April's eyes and mouth shut to keep her quiet and leaves without releasing her. While Ross and Nikki take the dog to the veterinarian, policemen and a TV crew raid the trailer where Frisbee , another one of Spider Mike's customers, lives, falsely believing that a meth lab is located there. They take Frisbee and his overweight mother into custody, where they threaten him into cooperation in a drug bust. The same day, Ross and the Cook stop by a local gas station to pick up a case of ephedrine pills and a soda. Next they go to a liquor store to purchase beer; here the Cook beats up a customer for disrespecting the two female clerks. They then visit an adult film store, where the Cook preaches about the values of pornography in America. Ross calls Amy's house again, but to no avail. He drops the Cook off at his place and rushes home to April, who is still tied to the bed. In the Cook's motel room, he and Nikki have a fight after a prostitute arrives in response to the Cook's call. Nikki ends their relationship, and calls Ross and asks him to take her to a bus station so she can go back to Las Vegas. Ross leaves April again, who is still tied to the bed; she is subsequently rescued by Ross's lesbian neighbor , who beats up the same liquor store customer when he disrespects the clerks again. While Ross and Nikki are out, Frisbee is coerced by the cops to wear a wire and buy some meth from Spider Mike so they can arrest him. When he enters, Cookie attempts to make love to him, her revenge on Spider Mike for his use of a phone sex line. She finds the wire, and the cops rush in to make the drug bust. Spider Mike, furious at Frisbee's betrayal, shoots him in the testicles, and Spider Mike and Cookie are arrested. Meanwhile, the Cook's meth lab catches fire and destroys the motel room. He takes off to the adult film store, where he is arrested after the owner  calls the police. Once the Cook makes bail, he calls Ross asking for a ride to another dealer's house in the city after he drops Nikki off at the station. Ross learns of everyone else's arrests, and agrees to drive him there, as well as visit Amy, who also lives in the city. The dealer  provides the Cook with cash, some meth, and the equipment to start a new lab. Ross calls Amy again, and leaves a message asking to see her and that he has her money with him. The Cook promises six months' worth of meth to Ross in exchange for being his chauffeur; he agrees on the condition that he can see Amy first. Amy, who has gotten her life together and found work in the city, leaves him in the park after seeing that he is still using drugs. He gives her $100 of the money he owes her, and leaves with the Cook. Finally, after several days of nonstop activity fueled by drug use, the main characters all go to sleep except for the Cook. As Ross naps in his car, the Cook starts up a new lab in an old trailer, but blows it and himself up in the process.
