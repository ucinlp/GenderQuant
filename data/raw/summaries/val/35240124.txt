Sooper Se Ooper features multitalented actor Vir Das and Kirti Kulhari in the lead role. The film also features Yashpal Sharma and is directed by Shekhar Ghosh. Vir Das was recently spotted in Jaipur, Rajasthan shooting for "Sooper Se Ooper". After shooting in Mandawa, a small town near Jaipur for ten days, the cast and crew came to Jaipur to shoot at the airport. The scenes that were shot in Mandawa had actors Kirti Kulhari, Yashpal Sharma and VJ Yudhiishtir. But the airport scene shot in Jaipur only had Vir Das. Vir will be seen in two different avatars in the film - one in jeans-shirt, and the other sporting a dhoti and a pagadi with moustache. While shooting in Mandawa, Vir Das had to sit on top of the camel for most of the scenes. The film is about a city guy who goes to rural Rajasthan and the comedy that follows. Sooper Se Ooper also stars Gulshan Grover as a don. Naseeruddin Shah was offered the role, but due to date constraints could not take it up. Grover plays a London-based don who returns to his home town, Rajasthan where Deepak Dobriyal and Yashpal Sharma join him as his accomplices. Interestingly, Vir’s love interest Kirti plays Grover’s daughter.
