Lucas  has been in prison for armed robbery. On the day he is released, he gets taken hostage by Ned Perry , an incompetent, novice criminal who robs the bank  at the moment Lucas just happens to be there. Detective Duggan  assumes they must be in it together and sets about tracking them down. Several chases, an accidental shooting, treatment from a crazy vet and other capers follow, all the while Lucas trying to ditch his idiotic companion and prove his own innocence. Whilst avoiding the law, the two form an unlikely partnership to help cure the silent Meg and make good their escape. They rescue Meg from the care home she's in  and flee for Canada, pretending to be a married couple with a son. All appears to end well. However, in the closing scene, Perry enters a Canadian bank to change some currency only to find himself taken hostage by a different bank robber in the same manner he originally kidnapped Lucas. Because of this unexpected development, Lucas does not need to say goodbye to Meg, with whom he has formed a bond.
