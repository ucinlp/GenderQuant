The film's plot is quite different from the book. Set during the Depression, it starts with Dove and Kitty leaving Texas for New Orleans. Dove is hoping to find his lost love Hallie. After Kitty steals from the café, Dove makes things right with the owner, who lets him stay while he searches for Hallie. He finds Hallie at the Doll House, a 1930's New Orleans bordello, where Jo is the madam. We learn later that Jo's husband had lost his legs in an accident, after which Jo lost interest in him. It is subtly implied that there is a lesbian relationship between Jo and Hallie, because Hallie enjoys the support of Jo to pursue her interest in sculpting, but it is clear that Hallie works for Jo as a prostitute like the others. The relationship is not loving, more possessive. Annoyed with Dove, and using the accusation that he brought underage Kitty across state lines and raped her, Jo tries to force him to leave without Hallie. In the end, in a struggle at the café, an accidental gunshot kills Hallie.
