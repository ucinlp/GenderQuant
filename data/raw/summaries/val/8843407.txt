Zasu and Thelma are two young women at home complaining about all of the dates they have been on. In every case they have been taken to Coney Island. The next day they are walking in the street when a car goes by and they are splashed with mud and water. The driver stops and offers to buy them some new clothes. They accept the offer and later agree to go on a date. The date happens to be at Coney Island once again. The date doesn't go well and they are glad to go home.
