Astronaut Capt. Richmond Talbot inadvertently volunteers to make the first manned flight around the moon. He is ordered to keep the upcoming moon flight a secret, even from his family. Due to the classified nature of the mission, he is placed under the watchful eye of several national security agencies. Despite all of their precautions, Talbot is approached by Lyrae, a mysterious “foreign” girl who seems to know all about the astronaut's mission. She approaced Talbot to warn him about possible defects in his spacecraft. The various agencies assume she is a foreign spy. Eventually Lyrae reveals that she is a friendly alien from the planet Beta Lyrae. She wants to offer him a special formula that will safeguard his rocket. Enchanted by the girl, Talbot sneaks away from the FBI, NASA, and CIA agents who have been guarding him to spend more time with Lyrae. Eventually, after his rocket is launched, Talbot discovers that Lyrae has stowed away. The two sing a romantic song about Beta Lyrae while mission control is confused by the bizarre transmissions.
