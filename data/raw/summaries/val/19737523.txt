In the present, a plague breaks out and the infected have been transformed into zombies. The action starts 80 years after the initial outbreak. The western United States has devolved into a disconnected series of ghost towns overrun by zombies such as the Toar Zombie and the Little Girl Zombie, and the government is awarding bounties in exchange for the pinkies of the undead. Ryn survives and follows Remington with the aid of Hans Tubman , a foreigner who double crossed him, in order to retrieve the sack of pinkies he had earlier collected when the movie began.
