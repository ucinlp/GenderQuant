Two feuding families of stereotypical hillbillies, the Weavers and the McCoys, spend their time taking potshots at each other. At one point, a McCoy asks if there are any Weavers in the movie audience. One man, shown as a silhouette against the screen, answers in the affirmative, and the McCoy takes a shot at him. In the midst of the fray, a yodeling, bulbous-nosed, domestic peace activist enters the feud zone on a motorscooter bearing the words "Elmer Fudd, Peace Maker", and goes to each side preaching peace and an end to wanton bloodshed. Neither side is impressed, and when "Elmer" attempts once more to preach peace to both families, both sides get furious at him and open fire on the would be peace maker together. When the smoke clears, only "Elmer" is left standing. He gives a final yodel and says "Good night, all!", and the Weaver in the movie audience yells "Good night!," taking one more shot at the star.
