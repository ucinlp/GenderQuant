The movie is loosely based on the story of a town in Oklahoma that had to be moved as a result of the construction of a dam creating Lake Keystone. There is a local legend about a train carrying gold in the 1800s which overturned. The gold is said to have rolled off the mountain pass into the valley, which is now at the bottom of the lake. The writers updated the story to be about young Will Taylor  who witnessed the murder of his father and aunt, who waited in the old bank building for the funds to be moved to the new bank building, just prior to the flooding of the town. The guards supposed to transport the funds, rob the bank and murder its owner. Will grows up and now works on the Lake that hides the secrets of his past. As Will learns about his history and the submerged treasure, the villain, Carl Bennett  returns from prison to collect the money he left at the bottom of the lake.
