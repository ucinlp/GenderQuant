In the 1900s, two young boys are sent to live in a Scottish settlement in Nova Scotia, Canada, with their stern Grandaddy  and Grandma  after their father's death in the Boer War. The boys would love to have a dog but are not allowed, Grandaddy holding that "ye canna eat a dog". Then they find an abandoned baby. Living in fear of Grandaddy , they conceal the child from the adults. They see the baby as a kind of substitute for the dog they have been denied . Grandaddy is having problems with the Dutch settlers who have arrived at the settlement in increasing numbers after leaving South Africa at the end of the Boer War. He has had a long-running dispute with Afrikaner Jan Hooft over ownership of a hill and refuses to accept a legal ruling that the land, in fact, belongs to Hooft. He also keeps a close rein on his grown-up daughter Kirsty  and is reluctant for her to make a life for herself. Kirsty is in love with the local doctor Willem Bloem, who left Holland for Canada for reasons he will not disclose. He does not return Kirsty's affections. To make matters worse, it turns out that the "kidnapped" baby is Hooft's younger daughter. When found out, Harry is tried at a court set up in the local trading store. He is suspected of taking the child as a result of the tensions between the two families but states that he did not know the identity of the baby. Surprisingly, Hooft speaks up in his defense, stating that no harm had come to the baby and his daughter should have been looking after it. The court official suggests that Harry be sent to a corrective school, and is immediately threatened with shooting by Grandaddy. The clerk climbs down, merely suggesting an investigation into the location of these schools in case a further kidnapping should occur. Afterwards, Grandaddy thanks Hooft for speaking up for Harry. The film ends with Grandaddy  instructing Harry to write to a mail order company to order the red setter they had set their hearts on. He had found the flyer for the dog in one of his best boots, where the boys had hidden it. They had noticed that he sometimes walked without these boots, slinging them over his shoulder, to save wear and tear. To pay for the dog, Grandaddy had sold the boots â€“ a prized item among his few possessions. Davy is now able to say, "I think we'll call him Rover, Harry." One of the film's most memorable moments comes with the horror on Duncan Macrae's face at what his grandchild must have thought of him when the little boy implores "Don't eat the babbie".
