The play takes place in an unnamed American city during the Depression, in 1932. The head of the family, Leo, and his wife Clara are middle-class and prosperous. However, over the course of the play Leo and his partner Sam lose their handbag business and the family must come to terms with this. The other characters in the play include a friend, Gus, and his daughter, Libby, a frivolous and self-centered young woman who is newly married to Leo's son Ben; a boarder, and an assortment of other characters. Odets said of "Paradise Lost" that he'd hoped that after people see it, "they're going to be glad they're alive."Olszewski, Tricia. The Washington Post, November 25, 2004, p. C01
