When Inspector Mahadev Bhosale  is asked by his seniors to form a hit squad to take on the Mumbai underworld, he recruits Shiv Narayan , an honest and brave police officer who had been suspended for an encounter killing. Together, Mahadev and Shiv along with others in the "Department" take on underworld don Sawatya  and his gang. Sawatya, in spite of many exhortations by his number two, D.K. , and D.K.’s feisty girlfriend, Naseer , does not hit back at the police. There is also the gangster-turned-minister, Sarjerao Gaikwad , who takes Shiv under his wing after Shiv saves his life at a public rally. Mahadev warns Shiv that Sarjerao is just using him. After a certain turn of events, it is exposed that Mahadev is actually working for Mohammad Gauri, who is actually an underworld don, and is, at the ganglord’s behest, finishing off Sawatya’s gang. While Shiv declines to be a part of Mahadev’s corrupt world, and Mahadev agrees to let him be, things start falling apart between the mentor and the apprentice when Shiv starts taking on a sub-gang formed by D.K., under Mahadev’s protection. What happens next? Do Mahadev and Shiv come to loggerheads? What about the Sawatya and Mohammad Gauri gangs? What role does Sarjerao play in the final outcome of all this? The rest of the drama answers these questions.
