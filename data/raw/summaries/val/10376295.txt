A group of lazy, ignorant highschool students, in no rush to graduate, have settled into life at their private school, paid by neglected parents, where they have bonded as a family and are cared for by school attendant Hafize Ana who has accepted them as her real sons. Their kingdom over the school is challenged by a new principal who, despite his warm hearted nature, takes on the role of tough disciplinarian and becomes the butt of their tricks and jokes as he prepares them for life.
