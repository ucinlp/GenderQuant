Introduction: The cartoon begins with Wile E. Coyote  assuming the "on your mark" stance used in track and field events. As soon as he goes into "get set" mode, he hears the familiar beeping sound and gets shocked into a backward move, suspended in mid-air atop a ravine. The Road Runner  issues the gunshot that causes the Coyote to drop . The credits then show in the dust. The Coyote walks away and soon comes up with a plan. 1. The Coyote first puts out his foot in the road to trip the Road Runner, only to get his foot flattened by a truck. He ends up having to limp off the screen. 2. The Coyote then tries to use a bow and arrow to try and spear the Road Runner. This is unsuccessful; instead of launching the arrow, the bow hits the Coyote, who falls off the edge of the cliff. The wood then grabs onto a ledge, therefore slinging the Coyote back up. Now it's the string that's on the ledge, while the wood is on Wile E.'s head. Wile E grabs the cliff from which he fell; at that very moment the string breaks a piece off the ledge, which shoots back up towards the Coyote. He is squashed, and a piece of the cliff he was hanging onto breaks off and falls with the Coyote and the other rock. The Coyote awakens and finds that the cliff segment is over him. He pushes the rock away and almost loses his balance, but gets back on the rock. He pants with relief, but then he lands on one end of a rock see-saw. The other rock lands on the other side, catapulting the Coyote back to the cliff, where he ricochets off it and ends up catapulting the other rock and then squash himself. 3. Then, the Coyote plans to drop the Road Runner in a manhole. When he hears the "beep-beep" of his opponent, he pulls the rope supporting the manhole cover. Just before falling into the manhole, the Road Runner picks up the manhole and takes it away. Furious, the Coyote chases after the Road Runner, but then the manhole cover falls on his head. He continues the chase, which ends when the Road Runner puts the manhole on a suspension bridge, which results in the Coyote falling in a hole in the bridge. 4. The Coyote now uses a Batman-like outfit attached to a rocket, but instead of launching the Coyote, the rocket explodes, sending a charred Wile E. falling. 5. Wile E. now uses Acme iron bird seed to attract the Road Runner. The Road Runner munches it all up and zooms off. Now the Coyote uses roller skates and a magnet to catch up with the Road Runner. They then chase until the Road Runner moves onto a railroad track, so Wile E. can be attracted to another magnetic material: an approaching train! 6. The Coyote then uses a springy block of pavement to try and trap the Road Runner in midair. However, the Road Runner stops short before the pavement springs up. This time, it springs up a little too hard; it does a 180 and ends up on top of the Coyote. 7. Now, Wile E. uses two machine guns attached to the same rope, but the Road Runner breaks the rope instead of pulling it. The Coyote, confused, tries to tie the rope back together, but then gets shot repeatedly and reduced down to size. 8. Finally, Wile E. buys a rocket sled and 30 miles of railroad track. Instead of going forward, however, the sled shoots up, past many stars and satellites, until the rocket sled explodes, forming a Sagittarius-like constellation of Wile E Coyote.
