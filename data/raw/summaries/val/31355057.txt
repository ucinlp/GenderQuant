Succeeding in his plan, Maltazard used the telescope  to enlarge himself to human size while trapping Arthur in his small size. Accompanied by Selenia and Betamache, Arthur remembered an enlarging potion at his house and attempts to get it. However, Matlazard is aware of it as well and intends to use it to enlarge his followers to begin his conquest of the town. Maltazard succeeds, but Arthur returns to human form using an Elixir of Life from a queen bee. Archibald convinces Darkos to switch sides and become good, and enlarges him with a second potion he had hidden. Arthur makes his way to town and battles Maltazard with the help of Darkos, who stays true to his word. Using another one of Archibald's potions that shrinks things, Selenia and Betamesh shrink Maltazard back to his Minimoy size and Arthur captures him, as the US Army shows up and defeats Maltazard's forces. Maltazard remains a prisoner of Arthur's family, and every Sunday, Arthur's grandmother Daisy brings him a piece of pie as she promised, but leaves it outside his cell where he can't reach it.
