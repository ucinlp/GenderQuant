The documentary film was shot at the preamble to the football international match of June 30, 2000, between Tibet and Greenland. For the Tibetans in exile this was the first international match after many decades since the former national team had broke up. The film starts from the moment of the first training sessions in Dharamsala in northern India and ends with the last whistle of the match in Kopenhagen, Denmark. The match was won by Greenland with 4-1. The Tibetan Buddhist background of the players is notable in the game mentality of the players who don't show any aggression. This invokes scenes of the trainer. He believes in discipline, hard working and a strong winners mentality.
