The film consists of three loosely connected segments based on the central theme of a mortuary. Mortician Shishedo is grief-stricken when his favourite pop star, Lam Wing-si, is killed in a car accident. Lam's face was badly marred and Shishedo takes her place in the coffin by disguising himself as the deceased singer. He disappears and leaves his colleagues to deal with the ghostly aftermath. In the next segment, Gigi wants a memorial service for her late mother, who had hanged herself. The ghost of Gigi's mother is displeased when the greedy morticians try to trick her daughter into using their services, and she haunts them. The last segment involves a mortician named Hung, who commits suicide after her boyfriend dumps her because of her job. Her boyfriend faces retribution when her ghost returns to haunt him and he dies in an accident later.
