A couple, Fred ([[Henry Kendall  and Emily Hill ([[Joan Barry , living a mundane middle class life in London, receive a telegram informing them of a small fortune given them by an uncle as an advance against their future inheritance, so that they can enjoy it in the present. Immediately Fred takes leave from his job as a clerk and they leave on a cruise for "the Orient". Fred quickly shows his susceptibility to sea-sickness while crossing the English Channel. While in Paris both are scandalized by the Folies Bergères, demonstrating their shared lack of sophistication. Fred's sea-sickness manifests itself day after day during the cruise. During this time, Emily begins a relationship with a Commander Gordon , a dapper, popular bachelor. Finally feeling well enough to appear on deck, Fred is immediately smitten with a German "princess"  who encounters him while retrieving the rope ring used to play deck tennis, a combination of tennis and quoits which was at the time widely played shipboard. Both begin spending their time on board with their new paramours to the virtual exclusion of each other, and each plans to dissolve the marriage in order to pursue these newfound loves. Events come to a head when the ship arrives in Singapore. Here, Emily leaves with Gordon for a home he has near there, only to realise while en route that she cannot go through with it and instead returns to Fred and their Singapore hotel room. Simultaneously, Fred prepares to leave for Burma with the princess, only to learn that she has embezzled £1000 from him and taken off for Burma alone. Upon further investigation, he learns that she was merely the daughter of a Berlin laundry owner and a common adventuress who often undertook to relieve wealthy men of their money. Warning Emily not to tell him, "I told you so", he advises her not to attempt to utilise her apparently morally superior position. The loss has left the couple with only enough money to be able to clear their hotel bill and to book passage home to England on a "tramp steamer". However, Fred and Emily's troubles have not ended, as the tramp soon is involved in an at-sea collision while they sleep, and they awake to find the ship derelict and themselves alone, the other survivors having all been rescued during the night. As it seems inevitable that the steamer will sink, the crew of a Chinese junk arrives to salvage the ship, employing tactics that suggest that they are in fact little more than pirates. However, they do take it upon themselves to rescue the Hills, feeding them a delicious stew. But when the crew tack up an animal skin on the wall, the couple realize that they have just eaten a stray cat that they had rescued from the steamer! They have other harrowing experiences aboard the junk before it arrives in port and they finally proceed home. In the last scene the pair are seen arguing in a manner most reminiscent of the scene immediately prior to the arrival of the fateful telegram.
