The film focuses on three beautiful American women in Madrid who fall in love. The film starts as ingenue Susie Higgins  arrives in the city and moves in with her old friend Maggie Williams  and her roommate Fran Hobson . Susie experiences a culture shock, when she is informed by Maggie and Fran that all rich, attractive men are taken, and all rich but poor are too proud to take on wealthy, American women. It becomes clear to Susie that she is nothing like her roommates, who use gain from their sexuality. Maggie, for instance, is a secretary who has recently ended an affair, and is now in love with her boss Paul Barton , much to the dismay of her co-worker Pete McCoy , a newspaper man. Fran, meanwhile, an aspiring actress, flamenco dancer and singer, stumbles upon an attractive Spanish doctor Dr. Andres Briones  during one of her hectic days, and immediately falls for him, even though he does not seem to be interested. While at the Museo del Prado, Susie catches the eye of wealthy playboy Emilio Lacayo . Homesick, Susie is comforted by the kind words of Emilio, and dismisses Maggie's warnings that he is a 'corrupt, heartless man'. During a formal party, where Fran delivers a musical performance, Susie is surprised by Emilio's interest in another girl and his lack of attention for her. Meanwhile, Maggie is upset that a dance between her and Paul is interrupted by his jealous wife Jane . She asks Pete a ride home and expresses her discontent in his plans to leave Madrid for Paris, which is caused by his dislike in Paul. Feeling that he is behaving too much as a playboy, Maggie admits that she thinks that he could be a great newspaper man if he tried. The next morning, Susie attempts to take revenge on Emilio for his behavior with a devious plan. Fran offers to aid her, but when she crosses paths with Dr. Briones, she dismisses her friend to spend a romantic afternoon with him. Briones criticizes Fran's mockery of her own career, though she rationalizes this by claiming that one should not be serious of a career that is going nowhere. Hereafter, she claims that Briones has left her and that she is planning on returning to the United States. Meanwhile - though without Fran's help - Susie is makes Emilio believe that she is falling for him. When he proposes for marriage, she hastely accepts and rushes into proceedings - with intention to scare him off - much to his surprise. Later that night, she confronts him with his playboy behavior, and he defends himself by claiming that he has fallen for her. At the office, a personal conversation between Maggie and Paul, during which Maggie discusses Pete's love for her and Paul expresses his dissatisfaction with current life, leads to a romantic embracement - though Pete walks in on them and storms off. That night, Paul wakes Maggie up with a phone call, and tells her that he is looking for Pete for an assignment. Maggie is upset that Paul thinks that Pete would be with her at night and throws a tantrum, blaming him for thinking that she is 'easy'. Eventually, Susie comforts her by informing her about her engagement to Emilio, until they find out that Fran has left the house. They worry about her, without realizing that she is spending her final days in Madrid in joy with Briones. She considers to cancel her plane to stay with Briones in Madrid, helping him to save money for his clinic, though he has too much pride to ask her not to leave. Fran returns home, saying her friends that Briones was too poor to support her. Meanwhile, Susie is stood up by Emilio on an afternoon that she is scheduled to meet his mother . She decides to bring his mother a visit by herself, and is shocked that Mrs. Lacayo has no idea who she is. She apologizes for her son's behavior and explains that this is not the first time that Emilio misled a girl, leaving Susie heartbroken. Back at home, Maggie is upset by her roommates' unhappiness and runs to a formal party with Paul. Though she is upset that he does not court her, unaware that this is a decision made by a serious conversation with Pete. Maggie leaves the ballroom, upset, and is confronted by Jane for being Paul's mistress. Maggie defends herself by claiming that Jane has lost her husband due to her lack of love for him, and when she furthermore expresses her pity for her, Jane slaps her and leaves. In turn, Maggie gets drunk and allows for Pete to take her home. They are about to kiss when she passes out. The following day, Maggie visits the office to inform Paul that she will return to New York with Fran and Susie. Paul accepts the situation and even arranges a meeting with Emilio to make him realize that he has made a mistake with Susie. On their final evening, the three women attend yet another formal party, where Paul announces his shift to New York. The women decide to stay and are all reunited with their men, though Maggie ends not with Paul, but with Pete, who has been called Paul's successor in Madrid.
