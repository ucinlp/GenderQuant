Jeff Cairn enlists in the Navy. He puts younger sister Nella in a cousin's care, but she misses the boarding house where they lived and where old Henry Pecket let her work on his sloop, docked out back. A waitress, Jeff's sweetheart Jenny, agrees to move into Sara March's boarding house to look after the girl. Sara mistakenly believes Henry is inviting women aboard his boat. Jeff is reported to be missing in action, while the sloop eventually sets out to sea and is caught in a storm.
