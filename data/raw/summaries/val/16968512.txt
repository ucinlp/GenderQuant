After the passing away of his son and Caucasian daughter-in-law, London-based widower Purshotam Agarwal brings up his granddaughter, Namrata, on his own. When she matures, he pressurizes her to get married to Tikamgarh-based Ranveer's son. She travels to India, and much to his chagrin refuses to get married to the boy of his choice, and instead brings back a wealthy person named Dev, who she claims is her fianc√©. Little does Purshotam know that Dev is not who he claims to be, and that Namrata has no intention of marrying him either.
