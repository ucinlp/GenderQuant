The gang is swimming in their favorite swimming hole, except for Tubby, who is scared to jump in. He finally does and his great weight and size causes all the water to splash out of the swimming hole, leaving the gang dry. Meanwhile, bully "Slicker" and his friends tie knots in the Our Gang kids' clothes and when the gang finds them, a total war is declared. Commandeered by Spanky, Buckwheat, and Tubby, the gang staves off Slicker's "troops" with a barrage of fruit, vegetables, rotten eggs and Limburger cheese. For a while, it looks as though Slicker has gained the upper hand, but the gang successfully mounts an aerial counteroffensive.<ref namehttp://movies.nytimes.com/movie/226206/Fightin'-Fools/overview |title2008-10-08|work=NY Times}}
