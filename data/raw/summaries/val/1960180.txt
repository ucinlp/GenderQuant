Made by Keystone Studios and directed by Henry Lehrman, in it Chaplin plays a spectator at a 'baby-cart race' in California. The spectator keeps getting in the way of the camera and interferes with the race, causing great frustration to the public and participants. The film was shot during the Junior Vanderbilt CupKids Auto Races at Venice, Cal. at The Charlie Chaplin Encyclopedia, an actual race with Chaplin and his co-stars improvising gags in front of real-life spectators. Unusually the camera "comes out of shot" to show a second camera filming , to better explain the joke. At this stage Chaplin only gets in the way of the visible camera on screen, not the actual filming camera. In so doing it takes on a spectator's viewpoint and becomes one of the first public films to show the film camera and cameraman in operation.
