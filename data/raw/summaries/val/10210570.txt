Set in the near future, UnCivil Liberties imagines a Big Brother-type government that uses technology to spy on its citizens. A militia assassin, Mike Wilson , is hired to kill a government agent, Cynthia Porter , who is reluctantly helping develop the technology. Wilson, however, can't bring himself to assassinate Porter, and soon his partner, Sam Norton , is hired to kill Wilson. After Wilson is dead and the militia headquarters are bombed, Norton decides to adopt Wilson's pacifism, and invites Porter to join him to change the future.
