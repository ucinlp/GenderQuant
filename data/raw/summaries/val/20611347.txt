The Pink Panther is beset with a flea that opts to reside in the panther's pink coat of fur. The feline tries several attempts to rid himself of the flea, like feeding him hot sauce on a frankfuter, jumping into the ocean and walking through a car wash. Finally, the panther shaves off his fur, causing the flea to find a home elsewhere.
