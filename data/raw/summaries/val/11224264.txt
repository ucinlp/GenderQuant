Maj. Joe Nolan  is the head of a mission to the South Pacific to retrieve an atomic rocket that vanished. Their plane crashes on a remote tropical island. They find a lone native girl  who indicates something fell from the sky onto a forbidding plateau that dominates part of the island. The party reaches the top despite numerous obstacles as viewers are subjected to long stretches of rock climbing , and discovers a lush jungle inhabited by dinosaurs. One of their party dies during the climb, another is killed by the presumed-extinct animal life, but four return to the flatland with a critical component of the rocket and escape as a dormant volcano erupts and destroys the island utterlyâ€”plateau, dinosaurs and all.
