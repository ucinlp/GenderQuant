{{Plot}} Tom is being scolded by Mammy Two Shoes in the kitchen warning him to keep the mouse of out the fridge or he gets thrown out and she hands Tom her broom. As she leaves, Tom holding the broom, marches around the kitchen alert. However, Jerry opens up a grille on the floor, exposing a hole, and directs Tom into it. Tom gives chase, but he trips over some empty milk bottles Jerry had moments before rolling into his path. Speeding out of control, Tom falls into a barrel of cider in the basement, and he drinks the cider.  Completely drunk, he befriends Jerry and makes his way back to the kitchen, drunkenly sharing the food with his new friend, making a mess in the process. When he pulls a tray of food from the fridge, it collapses on him with a crash. This wakes up Mammy, who comes downstairs to investigate what is going on. Jerry hides the drunken Tom, covering his mouth so that his hiccups are not heard. Mammy enters to discover the kitchen in a shambles, and badmouths the cat who she believes has gone AWOL. As Mammy leaves the room, Tom emerges from his hiding place, but he trips up over some of the spilled food and crashes into the refrigerator where he is squirted with some water, sobering him up again. Jerry, holding a leg of chicken, approaches Tom, unaware that he is now sober, and very angry. Tom chases after Jerry towards the bathroom, but slips on a bath mat and crashes into a wall. A bottle of bay rum  falls from the bathroom shelf and into Tom's mouth, causing Tom to become blitzed again. Tom takes Jerry into the dining room for dinner and rings the bell, expecting service for them both. But Mammy is upstairs, fast asleep and doesn't hear. The drunken cat grows impatient, and despite Jerry's objections, goes upstairs to get her. He takes a pitcher of water, recites: "one for the money, two for the show, three to make ready and four to go!" and douses her with it. Mammy screams furiously, hurls some furniture at Tom, and then chases him downstairs with her broom, wrecking the house in the process. Jerry watches the fiasco and goes downstairs and sees Tom being chased by Mammy into the night with Mammy missing every time as Tom's drunken hiccups lift him.
