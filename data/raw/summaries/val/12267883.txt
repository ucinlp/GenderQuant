Bob Maconel  is a disillusioned office worker with ideas of murdering his co-workers. However, on one particular bad day, Bob crosses the line from potential killer to inadvertent hero &ndash; fellow co-worker Coleman "goes postal" and shoots up the office before Bob does. Bob stops the shooter's plans by killing him with the gun he planned to use on the others, and in the process saves Venessa's  life. The former invisible nobody is suddenly thrown into the spotlight of public notice, he is considered a hero by those he wished to murder, promoted by a grateful boss to "VP of Creative Thinking" and given all the perks of higher management. Meanwhile, he saves the object of his desire only to have her ask him to end her life; her injuries have left her a quadriplegic. Venessa asks Bob to let her roll down a subway platform in front of an oncoming train. Bob debates whether or not to go through with it, scrawling "should I finish what Coleman started?", on a piece of paper. Bob doesn't go through with it and he stops her just before she reaches the train. They then discover that she can wiggle her little finger, providing hope that she may recover. Soon, Bob and Venessa become romantically involved. However, Bob is still trapped by the demons of his past, and has insecurities that as soon as Venessa recovers, she will leave him. However at the very end of the movie, it is revealed that Bob has been hallucinating all of the events since just before the initial shooting. This time, he is in the same position as his coworker was, only instead of killing his coworkers, he shoots himself in front of Venessa. The last scenes show police searching his house to find a note that reads "you may ask why I did what I did... but what choice did you give me? How else could I have gotten your attention?" In the news with reporters interviewing his neighbors, they say that "he was a quiet man."
