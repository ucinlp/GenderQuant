On an asteroid, the Terran Federation's Fort Casey is on top of a bug hive. The Starship Alesia begins to deploy its troops to seize and control the hanger and rescue any survivors. 'Alpha' team landed without much resistance from the bugs, after they rendezvous with what's left of Fort Casey's troopers, LTA Daugherty then decided to hold till the John A. Warden evacuates while the Alesia stands by for immediate evac. After setting explosives charges, the troopers began to head to the John A. Warden for evac. At the same moment, Dr. Carl Jenkins commandeers the starship John A. Warden for a classified mission despite heavy resistance from Captain Carmen Ibanez. At the same time Major Henry "Hero" Varro, the commander of Fort Casey's K-12 troopers, is escorted to the Alesia as a prisoner. While the troopers are still holding their ground waiting for evac, the Warden is seen departing the fort leaving the troopers behind. In the aftermath, the evacuation is successful, Fort Casey destroyed, but not without casualties from Alpha Team. While en-route to Earth, Alesia is re-directed to search for the Warden by General Johnny Rico. The K-12 troopers agree to do so on one condition, that Varro takes point during the mission. The Alesia successfully finds the Warden, Daugherty's team escorting Ibanez to the bridge while Varro's team secures the Engine Room. Varro finds a deranged Jenkins and is warned not to turn the light on inside the Warden but it's too late. It turns out that the The Queen inside takes control and lets out all the bugs that were on board. In the ensuing chaos, the Arachnid Queen destroys the Alesia before commandeering the  Warden into a nearby wormhole to Earth. At this point, Varro reveals the reason behind his incarceration, Jenkins ordered his unit to capture the Queen alive on Fort Casey, but Varro refused to sacrifice his squad. On board the L-6 Base, General Rico tries, and fails, to stop it after learning that the bugs have control of the ship. As it begins its descent into earth, Hero and the rest of the troopers, leaving Daugherty to protect Carmen began the hunt for the Queen too. Alpha Team sniper Trig, having used the ventilation shaft to assassinate the queen, manages to re-direct the Queen's attempted crashlanding away from Paris, and instead moving the ship to an open mountain range long before being killed by the bugs. Meanwhile, General Rico leads a squad of Marauders to stop the invasion by the bug-infested ship, while high command gives him 30 minutes before they prepare to drop nukes from the L-6 base to sanitized the site. Back on the Warden, the surviving troopers, composed of Varro, Ratsass, Mech, Ice Blonde, and Bugsrpay make their way towards the Queen. Ice Blonde protects Ibanez at a nearby airlock while Mech and Ratsass heads for the engine room to blow it up with C4. Varro and Bugspray find Trig's corpse. Attempting to revive Trig, Bugspray gets critically wounded, using Trig's family-made sniper rifle to buy Varro some time to reach the Queen. At this point, Jenkins, having recovered from his mental breakdown provides Varro back-up with his mind-controlled bugs. The Queen attempts to negotiate sparing the team's life in exchange for Jenkins's surrender, but is refused. Varro orders Jenkins to retreat, attempting to push his way toward the Queen. Meanwhile, Rico survives the failed insertion to the Warden and successfully saves Ice Blonde, Ibanez, Mech, Ratsass, and Jenkins. The orbital strike and the first attempt to get extracted were destroyed by the Queen. Jenkins has knowledge of a commandeered dropship he used to evacuate from Fort Casey with earlier, but knowing the Queen's chances of anticipation, Rico rushes in to distract the queen and attempts to save Varro. Varro however was critically wounded, and detonates a grenade to sacrifice himself against the bug swarm. Rico sacrifices his Marauder and uses a combat knife on one of the Queen's eyes, buying the team the much-needed time for Ibanez to make take-off preparations. Rico barely sprints back to the dropship. The dropship escapes the Warden, with the passengers surviving the resulting EMP caused by the explosion. Mech, Ice and Ratsass pay their respect to their fallen comrades while Ibanez confronts Jenkins over the recent crises. Carl sidesteps around the issue, telling Rico and Ibanez that his research will someday save the entire galaxy, shortly before the survivors get evacuated. In the aftermath, one warrior bug is seen navigating a sewer system, having survived the Warden's destruction.
