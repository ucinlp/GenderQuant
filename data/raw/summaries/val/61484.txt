On the northwest frontier of India during the British Raj, Scottish-Canadian Lieutenant Alan McGregor  welcomes two replacements to the 41st Bengal Lancers, Lieutenant Forsythe  and Lieutenant Donald Stone ([[Richard Cromwell , the son of the unit's commander, Colonel Tom Stone . In an attempt to show impartiality, the colonel treats his son coldly, which is misinterpreted and causes resentment in the young man. Lieutenant Barrett  has been spying on Mohammed Khan  and reports that he has been preparing an uprising against the British. Khan kidnaps Lieutenant Stone in order to try to extract vital information about an ammunition caravan from him. When the colonel refuses to attempt his rescue, McGregor and Forsythe go without orders. Unfortunately, they are caught as well. Mohammed Khan says, "We have ways of making men talk"  and has his prisoners tortured. Stone cracks under the pain and reveals what he knows. As a result, the ammunition is captured. The captives escape as the outmatched Bengal Lancers deploy to assault Khan's fortress. They manage to destroy the ammunition and Stone redeems himself by killing Khan, ensuring victory.
