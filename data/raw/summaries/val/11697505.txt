The cartoon starts with a brief narration  describing a labor shortage that "became so bad" that compels employers to hire "anybody or anything". Daffy  is a hotel bellboy and Elmer Fudd  is the manager. A tired man  asks for peace and quiet, and suddenly threatens violence against Elmer if disturbed at any time. Daffy, in a Jerry Colonna-like, sarcastic aside to the audience, remarks: "Likable chap, isn't he!" Daffy does many stunts that keep the man awake, complete with escorting him to room 666. Every time he is awakened again, the increasingly irritated man trudges to the lobby, to the tune of "Pop Goes the Weasel", and at the second where the song would say "pop", he busts Elmer in the face. After several shenanigans, Daffy finally concludes it is too cold in the man's room, he decides to fix the radiator. Elmer, fearing getting beat up again, chases after Daffy. Daffy makes the heat vibrate to the room. He hears whistling and covers it with several pillows. Daffy, thinking that he is blowing whistles proceeds to rant loudly to him. His screaming obviously wakes the now infuriated man, so Elmer hurries downstairs and he and Daffy switch places through a promotion in an effort to fool the man. Unfortunately he gets punched one more time. Daffy concludes the cartoon with another Jerry Colonna-like aside: "Noisy little character, isn't he!".
