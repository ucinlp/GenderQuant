The Stooges are inept janitors who stencil the wrong occupation names on the doors of their office building. As a result, their janitors' room is labeled as belonging to Omay, a famous interior decorator. Mrs. Smirch , who wants to hire Omay to redecorate her house, mistakes Moe for the real Omay, having just heard him so identify himselfâ€”only because he is trying to teach pig Latin to Curly. The Stooges agree to do the job and proceed to make a mess of Mrs. Smirch's house.
