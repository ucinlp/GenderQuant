Betty is the stenographer at the local courthouse. On the bus ride to work one day, she grows tired of the obnoxious actions of some of her fellow citizens , and fantasizes about what she'd do if she were the judge. Among her decrees: a thoughtless smoker learns about second-hand smoke the hard way, and an obnoxious celebrity impersonator is rewarded by having his ears blasted with imitations of Tarzan and the Shadow. The townsfolk overhear her complaints and vocalize their agreement, leading to Betty being elected as judge with full support from the town.
