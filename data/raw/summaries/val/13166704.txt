A group of friends go on a vacation camping trip. Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker named Ben, who invites them to his parents' campsite. When they arrive, Ben's father is in the process of setting up deadly traps to capture an Indian shaman that murdered two kids 15 years ago. As local superstitions have it that this shaman is a murderous demon summoned by the ancient Indians to watch over their burial ground and doesn't take too kindly to trespassing teenagers.
