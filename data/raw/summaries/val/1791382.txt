Having robbed and thoroughly destroyed a gas station in the first five minutes of the film, a group of street toughs with their own gripes against society sit in a convenience store and out of sheer boredom, decide to rob the same gas station . But, since the manager had the foresight to stash the money away, the four gang members take the manager and the employees hostage and then start dispensing gas to all the customers and keeping the money. As the film progresses, a mix of characters comes through the door, not all with good intentions, but with ludicrous results. A gang of school bullies comes by the gas station to harass one of the employees for money  The police come by demanding free gasoline . A customer refuses to pay for a full tank of gas, only asking for half a tank, and is taken hostage. More school bullies come by the gas station, seeking revenge for the first fight, but then they too are taken hostage. It's not long until they start attracting the wrong kind of attention, which leads to a violent confrontation. During the credits, four scenes show what the characters do after the events in the film.
