Rajaraman, nicknamed "Vasool Raja"  is a small time don in Chennai, making a living by collecting money from people who refuse or dilly-dally in paying their debts to others, with the help of his right hand man Vaddi . Given that his father had wished him to be a medical doctor, he creates the faux Venkataraman Charitable Hospital  and pretends to live in accordance with this wish whenever his father ([[Nagesh  and mother Kasturi  visit him in Chennai. One year, however, Raja's plan goes awry when his father meets an old acquaintance, Dr. Vishwanathan  and the two older men decide to marry Raja to Vishwanathan's daughter, Dr. Janaki "Paapu" ([[Sneha . At this point the truth about Raja is revealed. Vishwanathan insults Raja's parents and calls them "fools" for being ignorant of Raja's real life. Raja's father and mother, aghast and later heartbroken, leave for their village. Raja, in grief and despair, decides that the only way to redeem himself and to gain revenge for the humiliation suffered by his father at the hands of the spiteful Vishwanathan is to become a doctor. He decides to go to a medical college to obtain an M.B.B.S. degree, the graduate medical degree in South Asia. With the help of Vaddi and others, Raja "gains admission" to the SLR Institute of Medical Sciences, where he again encounters Dr. Vishwanathan, who is the dean. His success there becomes dependent upon the  help of faculty member Dr. Margabandhu . While Raja's skills as a medical doctor are minimal, he transforms those around him with the "Kattipudi Vaithiyam"  &mdash; a method of comfort taught to Raja by his mother &mdash; and the compassion he shows towards those in need. Despite the school's emphasis on mechanical, Cartesian, impersonal, often bureaucratic relationships between doctors and patients, Raja constantly seeks to impose a more empathetic, almost holistic, regimen. To this end, he defies all convention by treating a brain-dead man as if the man were able to perceive and understand normally; intimidating Dr. Kalidas  into admitting and treating a suicide patient interacts on familiar but autocratic terms with patients; humiliates school bullies; effusively thanks a hitherto-underappreciated cleaner; helping a terminally ill cancer patient Zakir ; and encourages the patients themselves to make changes in their lives, so that they do not need drugs or surgery. Dr. Vishwanathan, who perceives all this as symptoms of chaos, is unable to prevent it from expanding and gaining ground at his college. He becomes increasingly irrational, almost to the point of insanity. Repeatedly, this near-dementia is shown when he receives unwelcome tidings and he begins laughing in a way that implies that he has gone mad. This behavior is explained early on as an attempt to practice laughter therapy, an attempt that seems to have backfired &mdash; Vishwanathan's laughing serves more to convey his anger than diffuse it. Meanwhile, his daughter becomes increasingly fond of Raja, who in his turn becomes unreservedly infatuated with her. Some comedy appears here, because Raja is unaware that Dr. Janaki and his childhood friend "Paapu" are one and the same; an ignorance that Janaki hilariously exploits. Vishwanathan tries several times to expel Raja but is often thwarted by Raja's wit or the affection with which the others at the college regard Raja, having gained superior self-esteem by his methods. Eventually, Raja is shamed into leaving the college: His guilt for not being able to help Zakir gets the better of him. In the moments immediately following Raja's departure, the bed ridden man miraculously awakens from his vegetative state; at this point Janaki gives a heartfelt speech wherein she criticizes her father for having banished Raja, saying that to do so is to banish hope, compassion, love, and happiness, etc. from the college. Vishwanathan eventually realizes his folly. Raja later marries Dr. Janaki, learning for the first time that she is "Paapu".
