HMS Scorpion, a British submarine that had gone missing in the Baltic Sea during World War II, surfaces in the path of a Russian freighter in 1981. The vessel is returned to British custody. Naval Intelligence is interested in the case because it seems that, for the first time, a ship has returned from "the Devil's Triangle of the North". The submarine opens its own hatch to let the investigating team in, where they find the vessel in a state of perfect preservation, but find no sign of the crew. Jack Hardy  is the only surviving member of the original crew, having been found floating and rescued in 1943 by the German Navy; but he has no memory of the last days of the 1943 mission. He and Alan Cassidy, one of the vessel's designers, join a Royal Navy crew on a mission to retrace Scorpions last days before it went missing. Commander Travis, a naval intelligence officer, is in charge of the mission while Commander Byrnes captains the submarine. The mission will take the submarine into Soviet waters, and a surface ship, HMS Oakland escorts the boat. Once in the Baltic, the current crew begins to take on the personalities and identities of the dead crew, and the boat takes a degree of control over itself. Contact with Oakland is soon lost. A Soviet submarine is detected and through communication error the crew fires upon it and destroys it. Scorpion surfaces for a search for survivors, but, impossibly, no debris is found. Cassidy, who had supervised the fitting of the submarine with practice torpedoes, finds that they have become live weapons. Captain Byrnes tries to abort the mission, but Cdr Travis convinces him to continue. Hardy learns that the real mission is to discover and exploit the power that preserved and delivered the submarine. Soon, three aircraft are detected on radar whilst the submarine is surfaced. The aircraft are WWII Luftwaffe fighters that strafe the boat with gunfire. The captain is killed, and Travis takes command. Cassidy and Hardy find no bullet damage on the deck or tower from the strafing attack, and conclude that Travis may have shot the captain to preserve the mission. Travis apparently becomes possessed by the former captain himself. The original submarine captain's intent had been to torpedo ships in a German fleet in the then German city of KÃ¶nigsberg, which is now the Soviet city of Kaliningrad. Modern Soviet officers detect the incoming hostile vessel, and begin preparations for a nuclear war. Hardy manages to get the crew off the boat before it can attack the Soviet fleet, but Travis and the submarine, essentially as one entity, continue the attack. Hardy rewires the torpedo control system, causing the torpedoes to explode in the torpedo tubes killing Travis, and causing the vessel to sink. Hardy dies on his bunk clutching a picture of his wife when the water engulfs him. Six months later, the Soviets find the sunken Scorpion, looking like it had been decaying for forty years. The Soviets close their investigation of the incident. British intelligence intercepts the Soviet report, leading British military authorities to also close their files on the case. Neither Hardy's nor Travis' bodies are found.
