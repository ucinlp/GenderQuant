Daniel Dar√©us  is a successful and renowned international conductor whose life aspiration is to create music that will open people's hearts. His own heart, however, is in bad shape. After suffering a heart attack on stage at the end of a performance, he retires indefinitely to Norrland in the far north of Sweden, to the village where he endured a terrible childhood of bullying. Daniel buys the old elementary school in the village, and it isn't long before he is asked to come along one Thursday night and listen to the choir. He is only asked to listen, and maybe offer some helpful advice, but their intentions of persuading him to help are obvious. He eventually reluctantly agrees to assist. After the parish minister offers him the position of cantor, he accepts and sees the choir grow and develop, and rediscovers his own lost joy for music. Almost immediately, Lena , a young attractive girl in the choir, catches his attention. As they grow closer and fall in love, he realises that he seems to be surrounded by the villagers' personal problems. Inger , is married to the respected minister, Stig , but has failed to develop a loving sexual relationship with her husband. Siv , is so obsessed with morality that she cannot enjoy herself. Arne , is so ambitious for the choir's success that he obsesses over tiny mistakes but fails to see that he is making bigger mistakes himself. Tore , is mentally handicapped and shunned but is eventually included in the choir; Holmfrid , has put up with being called "Fatso" by Arne since their childhoods and eventually stands up to him. Gabriella , is beaten and abused by her husband, Connie  which is known and ignored by the whole village. She eventually finds the strength to leave him. Connie himself turns out to be the bully who was at school with Daniel and drove him from the village. He blames the choir and Daniel for his wife's stand and beats him up. This lands Connie in jail. The minister, Stig, is jealous of the choir's success and tries to close it down. His failure to do this precipitates his eventual nervous breakdown. The choir is accepted into the annual "Let the Peoples Sing" competition, and they journey to Innsbruck, Austria to perform. Lena fears Daniel will leave her for his re found sophisticated friends from the music world. They row make ap and then make love. On the day, the choir is ready to sing on the stage but Daniel is nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, Daniel's heart is affected by his anxiety and he has another heart attack. He staggers into the restroom, unsure of how to handle the situation, when he stumbles and hits his head on the piping below one of the basins, causing him to bleed severely. He lies helplessly on the tiles, blood gushing from his head, listening to the choir harmonising over the loud speakers. Everyone in the auditorium is enchanted and sings along. Daniel smiles to himself and then dies, in utter happiness over reaching his goal. The film implies that Lena is now pregnant with Daniels child. The final scene is of Daniel rushing towards his younger self as he embraces his life's goal, to "create music that will open a person's heart".
