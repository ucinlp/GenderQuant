In 1994, the Time Enforcement Commission  is created, with an oversight committee led by Senator Aaron McComb , to combat the misuse of the recent discovery of time travel, most often using the phenomena for monetary gain. A D.C. police officer, Max Walker , accepts a position as a TEC Agent, but that evening, his home is invaded by unknown men who shoot Walker , and the house is destroyed by an explosion, killing his wife Melissa . Ten years later, Walker apprehends his former TEC partner Lyle Atwood , who admits that he was working to raise money through the 1929 U.S. stock-market crash to support McComb's run for the presidency. McComb's plan, apparently, is to become so rich that as President, he will be able to act on his own accord without becoming just another corporate puppet. However, on return to the present, Atwood refuses to talk, having been threatened by McComb with the murder of his ancestors, which would wipe Atwood from history. With no options, Walker returns Atwood to 1929 where he falls to his death. Haunted by his inability to go back in time to save his wife, as using time travel for one's own desires is obviously forbidden by the TEC, Walker vows to stop McComb from succeeding. Walker is set up with a new partner, Sarah Fielding , and tasked to investigate a problem in 1994. There, they find the young McComb dropping his partnership with computer chip businessman Jack Parker - which cost the current-day McComb a fortune. McComb from the future arrives, and kills Parker, ensuring that he alone controls the company. Fielding reveals herself as a double agent for McComb, forcing Walker to flee. In the chase, the older McComb shoots and wounds Fielding before disappearing back to the future. Walker returns to 2004, where reality as Walker knows it as changed; TEC is being decommissioned, and as a result of Parker's death, McComb has profited greatly from the chip company, allotting him enough funds to virtually assure his presidency. With all records of Fielding gone in order to remove any witnesses to McComb's crimes, Walker commandeers the original time sled prototype to return to 1994 with help from his superior, Matuzak . In 1994, Walker finds Fielding at a local hospital, and convinces her to testify against McComb. While trying to find evidence of Fielding's existence in 1994, Walker finds a sample of Melissa's blood, indicating that she is pregnant. He realizes the present date was the day of his wife's murder, and sees it as his chance to avert it. When he goes to collect Fielding, he finds she has been murdered. With no other allies, Walker seeks out Melissa at the local mall and convinces that he is himself from the future, securing her help to protect the younger version of Walker. Walker from the future is present when young Walker returns home that evening. Walker recognizes McComb's men, and with Melissa's help, knocks them out, though the younger Walker is still knocked out cold outside the house. In the confusion, McComb from the future arrives, takes Melissa hostage, and plants a bomb in the home. It is then that Walker realises McComb was behind his wife's death, having travelled back to kill Walker as a young man after making an enemy of him in 2004. Though McComb himself died in the explosion, his younger self lived on and would still be guaranteed the Presidency. Walker plays his trump card: the 1994 version of McComb arrives, having received an anonymous message from Walker to come by. In the ensuing scuffle, McComb shoots Melissa, but Walker grabs the younger McComb and pushes him into his older self; due to laws of time travel, the same matter cannot occupy the same space at the same time. As such, the two McCombs fuse into a mass of blood which disintegrates into nothing, destroying McComb once and for all. Walker and Melissa escape the house before the bomb explodes. Walker leaves Melissa with his younger self and then returns to his present. Back in 2004, he finds the timeline has been restored for the better; TEC is back to full strength under a new Senator's oversight, McComb mysteriously vanished ten years prior, and Fielding and Matuzak are alive. Walker returns to his home and is surprised to find Melissa and his 8-year old son happily waiting to greet him, with news that Melissa is pregnant again.
