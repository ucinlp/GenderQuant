After the death of tycoon and philanthropist Oscar Winterhaven Oglethorpe, a ballet company is founded in his name by his widow, Lillian . The formation of the ballet company leads to ambulance-chasing attorney Roland T. Flakfizer  vying against Oglethorpe's former attorney Edmund Lazlo  to be director of the company. Lazlo is chosen to be director of the company after signing the greatest ballet dancer in the world, "The Great Volare"  to dance for the company. Flakfizer, however — with assistance from his two associates Rocco  and Jacques ([[Bob Nelson  — earns a spot as co-director by wooing the wealthy widow and by signing the company's leading ballerina  and her dancer boyfriend Alan Grant . The ensuing struggle between Flakfizer and Lazlo leads to comic hijinks, including a badger game involving a chorus girl , and an opening-night performance ludicrously sabotaged by Flakfizer and his cohorts.
