{{plot}} While driving at night along the San Francisco coast, architect-developer Dan Merrick  and his wife Judith  are involved in a violent car wreck. Judith is thrown clear, but Dan sustains major facial injuries and significant brain trauma, resulting in total amnesia. After extensive plastic surgery, Dan returns home in the care of his wife Judith. Frustrated by his lack of memory, Dan relies on those close to him to help him restore his past, including his business partner Jeb Scott  and Jeb's wife Jenny , who appears to know more than she lets on. While recovering, Dan has frequent flashbacks of imagery he believes to be events that led up to his fateful car crash. As days go by, Dan finds discrepancies in the stories he hears about his "former self". At one point, he stumbles upon photographs showing Judith sleeping with another man. Dan asks Jeb if his marriage was in trouble before the crash, and Jeb confirms as much. At his office, Dan finds an expensive bill he paid to a pet store, and follows up by visiting its proprietor, Gus Klein . Gus informs him that the payment was actually for services he provided as a private investigator, which he moonlights as. Gus tells Dan he hired him to tail his wife Judith, and that his investigation had revealed she was indeed cheating on him with a man named Jack Stanton . Despite Gus' advice to let it go, Dan intensifies his efforts to find the truth. He overhears Judith arranging a meeting with Jack Stanton, and promptly follows her. Judith stops at the site of an old shipwreck, which is apparently slated for removal by Dan's company to make way for a high profile land development. Assuming the wreck is a key in remembering his past, Dan has its removal postponed. One night, Jeb's wife Jenny tells Dan there is significantly more to his accident than he's aware of. Citing medical evidence and knowledge of the affair, Jenny accuses Judith of planning the accident to eliminate Dan, freeing her to pursue her relationship with Stanton. Now more suspicious than ever, Dan works with Gus to keep tabs his wife with wiretaps. After intercepting a communication between Judith and Stanton, Dan and Gus tail Judith to the hotel where she is to meet with him. Stanton leaves minutes after arriving, and a chase ensues through a heavily wooded area. After shots are fired from Stanton's car, Dan and Gus crash and Stanton escapes. Gus warns Dan to remain vigilant, and lends him a revolver for protection. That evening, Stanton's car arrives at Dan's home. Fearing the worst, Dan arms himself and lies in wait. At gunpoint, the intruder is revealed to actually be Dan's wife Judith disguised as Jack Stanton. Judith hastily explains that Jack Stanton is actually dead, and that Dan killed him the night of the accident. According to Judith, she had intended to stop the affair with Stanton, but Dan murdered him before knowing this. Judith goes on to explain that she and Dan decided to cover up the murder by disposing Stanton's body in the shipwreck, and that she had hidden these facts to protect her husband. However, when Dan reveals he postponed the ship's removal, Judith becomes hysterical and suggests they both should flee. Dan receives a frantic phone call from Jenny imploring him to see her. Upon arriving, Dan finds Jenny dead, and is confronted at gunpoint by Gus, who intercepted Jenny's call via the planted wiretaps. Gus explains he now thinks Dan indeed murdered Jack Stanton, and threatens to call the police. Pleading for his life, Dan convinces Gus to visit the shipwreck, so that they can find the remains of the body that will either vindicate or condemn him. Dan and Gus search the shipwreck, finding a chemical storage container. After opening the container, Dan dredges up a body of a man that looks exactly like himself—Dan Merrick. In a moment of clarity brought on by this shocking development, Dan suddenly realizes he is not Dan Merrick—he is, in truth, Jack Stanton. Flooded with flashbacks, Jack pieces together the real events that led up to the accident: An abusive Dan confronted his wife Judith with evidence of her infidelity. She called Jack for help, and Jack raced to her home, arriving moments too late to prevent her from shooting and killing her husband. Jack believed they should go to the police, but Judith convinced him to cover up the murder and hide Dan's body in the ship. After hiding the body, Jack told Judith he wanted out of the relationship. This angered Judith, and while distracted, she drove the two into the spectacular car wreck that began the tale. Now knowing the truth, Gus observes that Judith had banked on the chemicals in the ship dissolving Dan's body, but because it was actually Formaldehyde, she had ironically preserved the body instead of destroying it. He suggests the two leave, but is shot by Judith, who had followed them unsuspectingly. Judith forces Jack to leave at gunpoint. With Jack in the passenger seat, Judith drives erratically down the same stretch of road the two did the night of the accident. She claims she hid the real facts from Jack so that he'd have plausible deniability, and for his own peace of mind. The night of the crash, plastic surgeons simply assumed the man she was with was her husband Dan, since he and Jack shared the same build. She went along with this mistaken identity, and nursed Jack back to health as her husband Dan. Distracted by a police helicopter Judith loses control of the gun to Dan. Out of options, Judith decides to kill both of them in a suicidal car crash, but Jack rolls out at the last second, while she plummets to her death on the shoreline below. The police helicopter lands, and an injured—but alive—Gus Klein emerges. The police pilot calls Jack "Dan", asking him if he's OK. Jack doesn't correct him, and he and Gus walk back to the copter.
