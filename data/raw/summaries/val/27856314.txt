Two women dressed as clowns and a male driver are being chased through the countryside, from who or what reason we do not know. As the man drives, the women shoot at their pursuers. When the man is shot, the women are forced to burn the car with his body inside and once they remove their costumes, they run through a forest and later a cemetery in which one of the women, Michelle, is almost buried alive. Walking through a field, they come to the outside of a gothic castle. There they are bitten by vampire bats, which lead them to go into the castle, where they make love in a cosy bed. After that, they tour the castle and discover a few skeletons along with a woman playing an organ. She begins to follow them, so they shoot at her but she doesn't die. They run away and are caught by some men who force themselves on them. A vampire woman stops the men and the vampire woman who chased them almost bites them until they break away, but they soon come across a male vampire who is the last of his kind and he has plans for the women. They are bitten so that they continue his bloodline, but they must stay virgins. Michelle likes the idea of everlasting life but her girlfriend has serious doubts and by sleeping with Frédéric, a random passer-by, she not only jeopardizes the vampires plans but also puts the mutual love and friendship between her and Michelle to the ultimate test. The Vampire realises that he must not continue the bloodline and lets Michelle and her girlfriend escape.
