Soon after, LAPD arrives at his house, but they don't find him. One of the officers finds his badge that he left, revealing that he resigned from the force. FBI, learning about the events, launch a national manhunt on him. Meanwhile, Brian travels to Phoenix, Arizona on Interstate 10, where he wins a race. Next, Brian goes to Albuquerque, New Mexico on Interstates 10 and 25, and wins another race, then sleeps in a Town House Motel. Then, at a Texas diner, Brian sees his face in a newspaper article: "Alleged Fugitive, Undercover Cop, Still Missing", and "Vehicle Found Abandoned", implied that Dominic had abandoned the Toyota Supra Brian gave him, as he is seen driving a Chevrolet Chevelle SS in the post-credits scene of first movie. Just then, two local police officers arrive at the diner, and Brian quickly slips out of the diner, then drives away. Brian is next seen at a motel, watching TV, where he sees on Channel 9 News that he has just been spotted. He quickly packs his bags and leaves the motel. However, outside the motel, the police has already spotted his Mitsubishi, forcing him to abandon it. Brian eventually manages to hitch a ride from a woman in a Mitsubishi Eclipse convertible.

Brian then modifies the Skyline to increase its power and performance and repaints it silver . Brian then travels through Arkansas to Louisiana, where he is challenged to a race by two superbikes.
