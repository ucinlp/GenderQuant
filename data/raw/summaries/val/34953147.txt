What if a young woman who has spent her whole life being pushed around decides to grow a spine and break up with her clingy boyfriend? And what if she decides to do it on the night he has secretly planned to propose to her... in public? Priya's the girl, Rob's the guy, and it all goes down on the night of a karaoke competition. In a dive bar. In a dead-end South African town. Heartbreak shouldn't be this funny.
