 Donald Duck rides his donkey through the Mexican desert playing a guitar and wearing a sombrero on his way to see his girlfriend, Donna Duck. After briefly flirting with Donald, Donna dances the Mexican Hat Dance and eventually lands on Donald's donkey who throws her off his back. Donald laughs at this which angers Donna. She slaps Donald and after a brief bout of temper tantrum posturing, declares hatred on him, knocks him into a fountain, breaks his guitar over his head and storms back inside the house. Back outside, the donkey makes fun of Donald's misfortune which makes him mad. So Donald decides to exchange the donkey for a new car at a trading post . Meanwhile back inside the house Donna is destroying a portrait of her and Donald. But then she hears a car horn, and upon seeing Donald's new car, she is immediately won back. She lands in the rumble seat and gives Donald a big kiss. Together they speed off through the desert, but eventually the car has engine problems and stops working. Donald confidently tries to fix the problem , but the car overreacts and throws Donald out of the car and speeds off without him. The rumble seat closes on Donna and she is trapped inside. Donald chases after the car but is run over twice. Finally the car smashes into a rock and breaks apart throwing Donna out of the rumble seat, cross a waterhole and into a mud puddle. Once again, Donald laughs at this and Donna attacks him in retaliation with the car's horn and then rides off on her unicycle which she had conveniently carried with her in her purse. Donald is left alone in the desert with the donkey who had escaped from the trading post. Frustrated at his new car, Donald throws the horn at it, but the radiator explodes and the hot water lands on his sombrero shrinking it. The donkey laughs hysterically.
