{{Incomplete}} The film makes use of a frame tale to present three self contained "episodes" via flashback. Jane and Tarzan's first anniversary has arrived, and Jane is trying to find a suitable present for her husband, with the help of the elephant Tantor, and the gorilla Terk. When a party is suggested, the trio remember the disaster that occurred when three of Jane's friends arrive for a visit. As Jane considers a gift of jewelry, she is reminded of Tarzan's exploit with a pair of conniving diamond prospectors who take advantage of him and also trigger a volcanic reaction. Jane then decides on a night of dancing but changes her mind when she remembers how Bobby, one of her childhood friends, came to visit, only to be found out to be a treacherous spy to the Germans during World War I. Downhearted, Jane goes home without a present, only to find that Tarzan, wearing his fathers' suit; has thrown her a surprise party, he has also gotten her some jewelry and has a dance with her at the end.
