Romek Januchta  is a sensitive and honest young man who has a fascination with the magic of art. He finds work as a tailor at the opera. Confronted by the behind the scenes reality of stage productions—the bickering, the petty jealousies, the vindictiveness, and the corruption—Romek's illusions are soon shattered. A fellow tailor has been fired through the maliciousness of one of the performers, and Romek is faced with the choice of denouncing his friend.
