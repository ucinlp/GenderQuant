In the Sunan Kuning prostitution district in Semarang, Central Java, several prostitutes and criminals are living in close proximity. They are Lily , who wishes to marry and move away from the city; Ijan , a pickpocket and Lily's boyfriend, Mbah Genggong , an old robber who fought in the Indonesian National Revolution until he was betrayed; Yayuk , who was forced into prostitution to deal with her husband's gambling debts; Mangapul , an escaped felon who pretends to be rich; and Norma , who nearly slept with her brother while working. In the district, the children imitate the adults' behaviour and kiss in the streets, men work as pickpockets in the city proper, and corrupt businessmen, politicians, and police officers hire the prostitutes. Lily and Ijan plan to marry, but they do not have enough money to do so. When they are discussing it, Lily is interrupted by a customer who takes her to a room to have sex. Meanwhile, Yayuk and her husband are having marital difficulties as he continues to gamble and sleep with other women. The pickpockets steal a purse in town, but one is chased down and beaten to death by the crowd. Mangapul takes Yayak to a nearby warehouse for sex. They decide to marry, and after their tryst take leave of the brothel leader, then drive away for Surabaya. Mbah Genggong leads his men, including Ijan, to rob a jewellery store owned by a Chinese-Indonesian man. The store-owner's wife tells them to take the jewellery, so long as she and her family are not harmed. The bandits agree, then take the goods and escape to their hideout in an old farmhouse. Ijan takes a pair of wedding rings, and sneaks away to give the rings to Lily before coming back. Meanwhile, the police arrest Mangapul; he promises to marry Yayak from inside prison. After arresting Mangapul, the police go to Mbah Genggong's hideout. As the bandits flee, Mbah Genggong&nbsp;— who thinks he has been betrayed&nbsp;— kills Ijan with a blade and then attempts to attack the police, but is killed. As the district's residents come out and watch the police actions, Lily puts on her wedding ring.
