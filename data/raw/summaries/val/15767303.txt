'Pachamarathanalil' tells the story of Anu and Sachi. Sachi alias Sachidanandan played by Sreenivasan is a well known cartoonist who is much popular as the creator of Thumpi, a very popular cartoon character in a children's magazine. Padmapriya plays Anu, Sachiâ€™s wife, a government employee who is much obsessed with their 7 year old daughter's studies. They lead a happy family life with their daughter Sneha, who is the cynosure of all eyes and attracts attention wherever she goes and inspires the creation of the cartoon character Thumpi. The story begins to get hotter when an Advertisement film maker happens to notice Sneha accidentally and invites her to cast in his new advertisement film which is to be shot in Chennai. Sneha seems enjoying and easy going like a professional actress in the entire sets. After some days, the shoot is packed up for a shift to Bangaluru. The entire shooting crew can't believe their ears and eyes!!! An 8 year old child is virtually vanished into thin air on the highways from a speeding bus, amidst a shooting crew and her father!!! Sachidandandan, shocked at knowing the missing his daughter, becomes frantic. He could not even imagine what will happen if his wife happens to know the news. The drama at the highways takes a curious turn when CI Venkiti reaches the scene to investigate the case. Within a short time, the police claim that Sneha is not the daughter of Sachidandandan. The film goes on to tell what happened to Sneha and who actually Sneha is. It was later revealed that Aggi played by Lal was the father of Sneha. Aggi was unjustly accused and imprisoned for a bomb blast in Tamil Nadu and Sneha's mother died in childbirth played by Meera Vasudevan and Sachi had found Sneha when Aggi was caught by the police. Back in the present, Aggi allows Sachi and Anu to look after Sneha since they've cared for her throughout her life as he is led to the back of the police van.
