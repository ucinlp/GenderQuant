The film chronicles the life of Lena Baker, a young maid and mother of three. Convicted in 1945 of murder by an all-white, male jury, she was the only woman in Georgia to be executed by the electric chair. She had claimed self-defense in the fatal shooting of her employer, Ernest Knight, an abusive drunk who had forced her into a sexual relationship.
