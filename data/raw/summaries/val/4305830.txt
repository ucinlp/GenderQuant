A mutated strain of mad cow disease infects the Irish countryside, turning people into ravenous, flesh-eating zombies. Caught amid this chaos are a young Spanish tourist and the local gravedigger. Together, this unlikely duo must fight for survival or become part of the Zombie Fest. The gravedigger is also furnished with a deadly shovel, presumably used for digging graves and/or slaying zombies, dragons and other mythological creatures.
