The film starts as parody of a Soviet-era socialist realist film-making of the 1930s  Peaceful life of farmers of remote Uralian village is interrupted when their former collective farm is sold. The toughest ones unite and track down the offenders one by one. Their quest for truth and justice is very violent, although almost all the violence occurs off screen, and often we are unsure of the victims fate. The movie was shot in Black and white and the music is old Soviet movie music, so it is hard to determine when the events are happening â€“ around the WWII or maybe even today. Hence it could be interpreted as attack on modern capitalism in Russia.
