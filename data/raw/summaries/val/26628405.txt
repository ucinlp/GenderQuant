Sgt. Ryker is charged with Korean War treason, court-martialed, prosecuted by Capt. David Young, convicted and sentenced to die. His wife, Ann, insists that Ryker received an inadequate defense. She believes her husband's story that he had been on a secret mission, assigned to it by a superior officer who has since died and can no longer vouch for him. Capt. Young is not only persuaded to get General Bailey's approval for a new trial, he volunteers to defend Ryker this time. A grateful Ryker ends up furious when he discovers a romantic attachment is developing between his wife and the captain. The new prosecutor, Maj. Whitaker, unearths new evidence damning to the defendant's case. At the last minute, though, Young produces a sergeant named Winkler who verifies Ryker's story, setting him free.
