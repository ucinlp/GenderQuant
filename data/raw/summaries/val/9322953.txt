Secret U.S. military interrogations of suspected terrorists are being conducted on an American World War II-era ship in the Persian Gulf. After mysterious sounds are heard on the ship, an unexplained force kills the crew. When contact with the ship is lost, the army sends a team of Marines and two scientists to investigate. When they land on the ship, they discover that almost all the crew have been killed. The team, led by Col. John Willets , cannot make contact with command, while the ship drifts toward Iranian waters. Willets interrogates one of the scientists and learns that the mysterious force is the ghost of a Nazi officer who was created to be a secret weapon. The ghost, which has strong psychic powers, is trapped on the ship and the two scientists were sent to try to capture it. Meanwhile, the supposed terrorist being interrogated onboard turns out to be an MIT-educated decoy . He aids in the efforts to destroy the ghost, before being killed by it.
