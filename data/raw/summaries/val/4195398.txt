In 1944, engineer Major Baldwin  is ordered to blow up an airfield as well as strategic roads and bridges to help American troops in China retreat from the Japanese army. General Loomis  is reluctant to send Baldwin due to his inexperience as a commander, but relents. Baldwin, accompanied by reluctant conscripts, Sergeant Michaelson , Prince  Lewis , Miller  and Collins , the demolition team's translator, Baldwin finds out from Colonel Li , the Chinese commander that the Japanese are about to capture a munitions dump. Colonel Kwan  is assigned to the team but before they can embark, Madame Sue-Mei Hung , the American-educated widow of a Chinese officer, joins them, with Baldwin gradually becoming attracted to the widow. Baldwin blows up a bridge and pushes a truck over a cliff to keep on pace, trying to reach the munitions dump before the Japanese. Sue-Mei and Baldwin are at odds over his cavalier treatment of the Chinese when he resorts to blowing up a mountain road, leaving thousands of local Chinese residents homeless. After stopping at a village because Miller is ill, Collins tries to give out the surplus food the team has brought, but is trampled to death by starving villagers. Baldwin is furious and resolute in trying to complete his mission, finally successful in blowing up the munitions storage, but when his truck is stolen by Chinese bandits, Miller and Lewis are also killed. Baldwin exacts revenge by crashing a truck into the bandits' outpost and setting the village on fire. Baldwin asks Sue-Mei to understand why he had to act that way, but there is no reconciliation between them as the gulf of two divergent cultures is too great and she leaves him. Although recognizing his retribution was fundamentally excessive and brutal, Baldwin radios his report to headquarters, and is praised for fulfilling his mission.
