Several years after leaving the orphanage to which her father never returned for her, a young Gabrielle Chanel finds herself working in a provincial bar. She is both a seamstress for the performers and a singer, earning the nickname 'Coco' from the song she sings nightly with her sister. A liaison with Baron Balsan gives her an entry into French high society and a chance to develop her gift for designing increasingly popular hats. Coco falls in love with an English businessman named Arthur Capel , betrothed to an English lady, who believes in Coco's talent making hats and as a designer; as he says to Coco, "There's no one else like you". As Coco's business flourishes and life is going well, Capel dies in a car accident; she is devastated. However, Coco still has the business that Capel helped her start as a reminder of her love.
