Shuttlecock Boys{{cite web}} The one thing that unites these four friends is their common love for badminton. Every evening they meet for a couple of games in their neighborhood joking about their lives and pulling each otherâ€™s legs. This part of the day is the most pleasant part of their otherwise dreary lives. While playing badminton one such night, they decide to do something on their own. This very attempt becomes their lifeline putting them on a litmus test of determination, courage, luck and spirit of friendship.{{cite}}
