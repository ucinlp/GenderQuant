Jompa Torman is reluctantly on his way into marriage. The bride's family is gathered at the traditional engagement coffee at Kautokeino community centre when the Deadly Sapmi Assassination Squad, consisting of Tampa Buljo, Crazy Beibifeit, Dr. Kjell Driver and Bud Light assault the premises, draw guns, and fire on anything that moves. Nobody is supposed to leave the centre alive, but Jompa miraculously survives and falls into a deep coma. The Sami- and woman-hating police inspector Sid Wisløff are assigned to the case together with his assistant Unni Formen. Wisløff is confident that Jompa Tormann killed all his guests, finishing the act by shooting his own head four times to look innocent. A few weeks later, Jompa awakens, and begins to seek revenge. He has a Katana forged for him by the legendary swords-smith, Fugioshi Shinaga and sets out. He tracks down the members of The Deadly Sapmi Assassination Squad and settles his business with them one by one. Sid Wisløff and Unni Formen, aided by the Sami pathfinder Peggy Mathilassi are on his heels to put him behind bars.
