Krazy is driving his car on an urban road. As he goes on his journey, he spots a bird above, suspending something under its beak. The curious Krazy turned his vehicle into an aircraft, and takes off to investigate. Coming close in his flying car, he was amazed that the bird he spotted was a stork carrying an infant. He then sees the stork handing the child to a person on a rooftop before leaving. Although the bird leaves with an empty beak, Krazy continues to follow it. The feline follows the stork into an adoption center up on the clouds. Inside, he was intrigued to see orphaned infants groomed and taken out of the place by other storks for delivery. Lunch time came just then and one of the birds calls Krazy to watch over the infants. The infants are loud and bothersome but Krazy was able to keep them company. Suddenly, he receives a customer's order by phone. The cat then selected the suitable child for the delivery and takes off. Up in mid-air for a few moments, Krazy was carrying the infant smoothly. But things became quite difficult for him as the tyke starts playing mischievously. Nevertheless, they reached the customer's house on time. When the infant's diaper came off, the feline tries to put it back. The infant, however, refuses to wear it, and Krazy tries to do things in a scuffle, only to put the diaper on himself. The child then disappears mysteriously, and Krazy looks into the chimney. While he does, the infant shows up from the edge of the roof, and pushes him into the flue. Krazy falls through the chimney and into the house with a waiting couple inside. Because of the diaper he's wearing, the couple mistook him as the infant they ordered. The overjoyed wife then picks up, hugs, and smooches Krazy, much to the feline's dismay. After getting too much of the unwanted affection, Krazy removes his diaper and convinces the couple that there's a misunderstanding. Immediately, the infant he tried to deliver finally comes down the chimney and has been diapered somehow. The couple were even more please, knowing they got the correct order.
