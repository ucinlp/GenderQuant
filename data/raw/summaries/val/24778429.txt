From A Whisper is based on the real events surrounding the August 7 bomb attacks on the US Embassy in Nairobi in 1998. Abu is an intelligence officer who keeps to himself. When he meets Tamani, a young, rebellious artist in search of her mother, he decides to help. The discovery of her death churns up memories of Fareed, Abu’s best friend who also lost his life in the attack. The discovery forces them to learn how to forgive, to believe in themselves and confront what they fear the most – the truth.
