In 1957, Juno , an American archaeology student, is visiting Cyprus and staying with the family of her father's best friend, Dr Andros . She witnesses an attack by two EOKA gunmen which results in the death of two British soldiers, but is unable to identify the killers to the local British intelligence officer, Major McGuire . Juno then realises that fugitive EOKA General Skyros  is hiding in the house and Dr Andros is an EOKA collaborator. EOKA fighter Haghios  wants to kill Juno, in part because of her growing romantic relationship with McGuire. Haghios organises an ambush to kill Juno, but she is saved by Dr Andros' son, Emile, who is mortally wounded. Juno escapes and is rescued by McGuire, who brings her to his apartment. Haghios leads an attack on McGuire's apartment which is unsuccessful, in part because of help from fellow British intelligence officer, Baker , who had an affair with McGuire's wife. Juno flies to Athens and realises that Haghios is on the plane. On arrival, Haghios tries to kill her again, mortally wounding Baker, but is shot dead by McGuire. Juno is reunited with McGuire.
