{{Plot}} As a child, Catherine is talking to her mother about marriage. She wants to marry her dad  and her mom says, "You can't marry daddy, I'm married to him." The film then reveals what transpires 25 years later. Catherine is married to a young man, Caleb Holt , a firefighter in Albany, Georgia who lives by the motto "Never leave your partner behind". His relationship, however, with Catherine  is suffering and she wants a divorce. It seems as if they have different priorities in their lives, which has led to the breakdown of the marriage. Caleb and Catherine each fault the other for the disintegration of their relationship. Catherine characterizes Caleb as addicted to internet pornography and as selfish for saving money for a boat when she believes the money would be better spent on medical supplies for her ailing mother. Caleb says that he feels respected by everyone except his own wife. He also feels that Catherine does not value him.  When Caleb tells his father, John, about the impending divorce, John challenges Caleb to commit to a 40-day test that he calls the "Love Dare", and Caleb agrees. John is evasive about what the 'dares' consist of and Caleb is apprehensive. Catherine doubts Caleb's sincerity in his attempts to win her back. She is suspicious of Caleb's motives because she considers his efforts to be a ruse in order to obtain a larger sum of money in a divorce settlement. She feels that Caleb's acts are half-hearted. For example, when he buys her flowers, he opts for the least expensive option. Catherine is not impressed with this. Caleb does, however, refrain from insulting Catherine to her face. Caleb is frustrated because Catherine is still cold towards him. With encouragement from John, Caleb continues to follow his father's plan. Caleb's close friend Michael  also has faith in Caleb. Michael encourages Caleb to become a born-again Christian. Michael illustrates marriage through salt and pepper shakers. He talks about how you always see salt and pepper together, even though they are completely different. He glues the shakers together with super glue. Caleb tries to pull them apart, but Michael warns that if he does, the contents will make a huge mess. At the hospital where she works, Catherine, begins flirting with Dr. Gavin Keller , who does not know that she is married, since she is no longer wearing her wedding ring. Catherine informs Dr. Keller of her mother's medical situation. At the same time, Caleb injures his arm when rescuing a girl from a house fire and is brought to Catherine's hospital, where a nurse inadvertently says in front of Dr. Keller that Caleb is Catherine's husband. As he continues his 40-day challenge, Caleb  begins doing more household chores and running more errands for Catherine, and leaves her roses. He even smashes his computer to pieces with a baseball bat in order to remove the temptation of viewing Internet pornography. Regardless, Catherine, who is led by some colleagues to think that Caleb did all these things with an ulterior motive in mind, is still intent on divorce. When she later finds out that the equipment needed for her mother's medical care has been paid for in full, she arranges a lunch date with Dr. Keller, thinking that he was the benefactor. Caleb discovers Dr. Keller's relationship with Catherine and immediately informs him that he will not let him have Catherine without a fight. Dr. Keller, who is shown bringing out his wedding ring that no longer fits , starts distancing himself from Catherine. Caleb later finds Catherine at home sick, and decides to take care of her. At this point she asks Caleb why he has changed his behavior, and he mentions the Love Dare. Caleb then fully apologizes to Catherine for his past selfishness. Catherine knows about the Love Dare because of the book, but says that she needs some time to think about their future. Days later, Catherine learns that of the $24,300 cost of her mother's medical equipment, Dr. Keller gave only $300 and Caleb gave $24,000, exhausting his boat savings. At this point she becomes convinced that Caleb's desire to change was sincere. Ashamed at her inability to think that Caleb's change in behavior was genuine, Catherine immediately looks for and finds her wedding ring as if it was the most precious and valuable possession she owned, dresses herself up nicely and puts on make-up, and rushes to her husband's fire station. There, she embraces her husband with all the respect and admiration he craved before. Caleb's parents are relieved to know that their son's marriage has been saved and Caleb expresses his thanks to his dad for the Love Dare. At that point, Caleb's dad explains that his mother was the one who did the Love Dare on him instead of the other way around. Immediately after hearing this, Caleb rushes home and apologizes to his mother for criticizing her all those years. The couple then renews their wedding vows in an outdoor ceremony, this time as a covenant with God. The last shot shows a wedding cake with salt and pepper shakers where the "bride and groom" statues would usually be. One has a white veil and one has a black jacket and top hat, symbolic of the marriage vows Michael stated earlier.
