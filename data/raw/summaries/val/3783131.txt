In 1974, during the final days of the Vietnam War, Mark Lee  arrives in Saigon, intending to bring his uncle Ten  and cousin Cheung Chi-Mun  back to Hong Kong with him. Just after arriving at the airport, Mark is confined by corrupt security guards who strip and attempt to rob him, but he is saved by a mysterious woman named Kit , who seems to have some measure of influence. Mark and Mun later encounter Kit in a nightclub, where they discover the woman is a criminal and gun runner. Kit takes an interest in the cousins and invite them to accompany her on a deal with a local Vietnamese warlord. The deal goes bad, but the three escape. Kit is impressed with the way Mark and Mun handled themselves and decide to help them escape Vietnam, taking them under her wing in the meantime. Over the next few months, Kit begins training the cousins in various aspects of her business, as well as marksmanship. Mark and Mun both develop an attraction to her. Kit is attracted to Mark as well, and buys him a pair of Alain Delon sunglasses as a gift. However, despite his feelings, Mark does not reciprocate Kit's affections so as to avoid hurting Mun, who has come under the impression that Kit is in love with him. Meanwhile, the leader of the arms smuggling company , Ho Cheung-Ching, returns from hiding after a three year absence in which he was presumed dead. Jealous of Kit's relationship with Mark and Mun, he plots to kill the cousins. Kit manages to secure safe passage for Mark, Mun, and Uncle Ten back to Hong Kong. The three return and start a new business there. However, Ho Cheung-Ching sends a bomb to the business, which explodes and kills Uncle Ten. Afterwards, Ho and his men capture and beat Mark and Mun, warning them to stay away from Kit. Kit arrives to express her regret for Uncle Ten's death and to share her feelings with Mark, which this time he reciprocates. She also presents Mark with another gift: a black duster coat. Ho Cheung-Ching returns to Vietnam, taking Kit with him, to complete the deal with the Vietnamese warlord encountered earlier in the film. Mark and Mun follow Ho back to Saigon, intending to kill him in retaliation for his murder of Uncle Ten. Mark steps off the plane attired in his iconic outfit as seen in the first A Better Tomorrow: black duster, sunglasses, and matchstick in his mouth. Later, during reconnaissance on Ho Cheung-Ching by Mark and Mun, they engage in a shootout with Ho's men, where Mun is caught in an explosion. Mark confronts Kit in her hotel and despite her protests that she had nothing to do with Mun's death and is trying to protect them from Ho, Mark angrily says he wants nothing to do with her anymore. Ho Cheung-Ching and Kit head to their deal with the Vietnamese warlord. The warlord attempts to double-cross Ho but a mexican standoff ensues when Kit reveals the building is wired with explosives and her finger is on the detonator. Mark interrupts the stalemate by bursting in the room dual wielding two M-16 rifles, intending to take his revenge on Ho. A shootout ensues in which Kit is severely wounded and Ho is killed . Mun, who is revealed to have survived the explosion, arrives to help Mark make his getaway with the wounded Kit. The three are pursued by the warlord in a tank, but Mark manages to destroy the tank with explosives, killing the warlord. With Kit dying and in dire need of medical attention, Mark and Mun rush Kit to the embassy, where a mass evacuation is taking place due to the Fall of Saigon. Showing Kit's travel paperwork to the guards, the three are granted seats on the last chopper leaving the embassy, which lifts off just as the crowds rush in past the gate and the North Vietnamese flag is raised. Succumbing to her injuries, Kit dies in Mark's arms. Cradling Kit's lifeless body, Mark contemplates quietly as the chopper flies off into the sunset.
