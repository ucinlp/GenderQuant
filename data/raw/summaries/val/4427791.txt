Ambitious, callous, narcissistic, and at times unethical, Henry Turner is a highly successful Manhattan attorney whose obsession with his work leaves him little time for his prim socialite wife Sarah and troubled preteen daughter Rachel. He has just won a malpractice suit in which he defended a hospital against a plaintiff who claims, but is unable to prove, that he warned the hospital of a problem. Running out to buy cigarettes one night, he is shot when he interrupts a convenience store robbery in progress. One bullet hits his right frontal lobe, which controls some behavior and restraint, while the other pierces his chest and hits his left subclavian vein, causing excessive internal bleeding and cardiac arrest. He experiences anoxia, a lack of oxygen to the brain, resulting in brain damage. Henry survives, but initially he can neither move nor talk, and he suffers retrograde amnesia. He regains movement and speech with the help of a physical therapist named Bradley. Upon returning to his luxurious apartment, the almost childlike Henry is impressed by the surroundings he once barely noticed. As he forges a new relationship with Sarah and Rachel, he slowly realizes he does not like the person he was before the attack. His firm allows him to return to work out of deference to his previous contributions to the firm's success. As his firm takes away his old assignments and large office and essentially assigns him only busy work, Henry finds it difficult to remain a lawyer. After he resigns the family decides to relocate to a less expensive, suburban residence. He finds letters from a former colleague disclosing an affair he had with Sarah, becomes angry and upset, and leaves home. He is confronted by Linda, a fellow attorney at his firm, who reveals that they were also having an affair and that he had said he would leave Sarah. Henry, realizing that  everything had been wrong before, returns to her and is reconciled. Also, he gives documents from his last case that were suppressed by his firm to the plaintiff whom he now realizes was in the right. He also goes to take Rachel out of the elite school where she is unhappy.
