The plot of AIR: The Musical follows three interweaving storylines of people who feel out of place in the world. The first storyline consists of Dan  and Sarah  who are a socially awkward couple that meet in a head-on collision. Dan works in a parking lot booth as well as taking calls for a toothpaste hotline that are forwarded to his cellphone. Sarah works at home, stuffing envelopes so that she, in her own words, "Doesn't have to leave the house." The second story involves a middle-aged couple, Malcolm  and Julie Anne . Malcolm is a middle-management-level boss at a telecommunications company in the city, and Julie Anne is a waitress and single mother living in rural Kansas. After an employee pulls a gun in his workplace, Malcolm drives away from the city, and ends up sitting next to Julie Anne in a Country-Western bar in the middle of nowhere. The third story involves Donnie  and Kathy . At the beginning of the story, the two are already dating, but Donnie is so self-obsessed with the music that he's writing that Kathy breaks up with him. The film moves in and out of these three storylines, and when times are at their worst for the characters, thing are shown literally falling apart. The cars that Dan and Sarah are driving crash into each other and become welded together upon impact, a car catches on fire as things don't go well on Dan and Sarah's date, a moving company drops a couch off of a two story building in the middle of the night as Kathy walks by alone. As the characters move through the film and begin to fall in love , the world starts to repair itself and come back together.
