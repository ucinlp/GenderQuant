Turner and Quaid play Jane and Jefferson Blue, a wise-cracking couple of spies for an unnamed U.S. covert organization on maternity leave in New Orleans with their baby daughter whom they dote on, though they are unable to agree on whether her name should be Louise Jane or Jane Louise. With the baby's arrival, they have decided to move on to "Chapter Two" of their marriage, retiring from field assignment in an attempt to give their daughter a normal life. However, events continually conspire to draw them back into their old lives, including fruitless attacks by a frustrated mugger  while being called back into service to combat a psychotic Czech arms dealer .
