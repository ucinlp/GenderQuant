After surviving their expedition to King Solomon's Mines, Allan and Jesse have settled down in colonial Africa. They are engaged to be married and Jesse plans that they will travel to America for the wedding. But Allan is restless. A man chased by two strange masked men emerges from the jungle, and is recognised as one of Quatermain's friends. He is delirious and is cared for by Jesse and Allan, but at night, his pursuers return and kill him. Before he died, he told Allan that his brother, supposedly lost, is alive, and that they have found the legendary 'Lost City of Gold'. Quatermain immediately starts preparing for an expedition to find his lost brother. Jesse is furious and stalks off, but then realises how important this is to Allan. Allan and Jesse are assisted by Umslopogaas, a fearless warrior, to put together an expedition. Swarma, a spiritual guru, and five Askari warriors, accompany them. The group crosses the Sahara desert; two Askari are lost when Swarma trips a trap that opens a pit under the road to the city. Another member of the party is lost when savage Esbowe warriors attack the group. Many spears get thrown at Quatermain and his friends, but Umslopogaas deflects most of them by with his giant axe. Quatermain and his friends indeed discover the city. The inhabitants, both black and white, are friendly, and Allan meets his brother Robeson, seemingly in good health and at peace in the society. The city boasts two queens - white and black - but the real leader is an evil High Priest, Agon, feared by all. Allan raises the population against Agon, who musters an army to recover the city by force. Allan realises that they can make all the weapons they need out of gold, which is mined by the population. The final battle ends when, atop the temple, the gold  flows off the side of the structure and pours over the attacking horde, turning Agon's army into gold statues. How this is possible is left unexplained.
