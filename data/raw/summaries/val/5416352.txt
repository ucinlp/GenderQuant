The alien criminal from the first movie is dead, but he left a few eggs which are hatching now. It is explained that on the alien's homeworld, evolution took two parallel paths: half of their race became violent criminals who live only for pleasure , and the other half evolved beyond their base desires and even physical bodies, becoming creatures of pure energy. The good alien , who still inhabits Tom Beck’s body, has been waiting just in case this happened. Unfortunately, his presence in the body has taken a terrible toll on it, draining it of life energy. Additionally relations with Beck’s daughter Juliet , now a cop herself, have deteriorated . But when the killing starts again, both will need to work together - and with a new alien policeman , who comes to Earth to aid in the struggle - to stop the new generation of aliens.
