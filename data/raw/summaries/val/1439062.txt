The film starts off with a young boy watching a horror film on TV showing a toy mechanical monkey killing off an eldery gypsy. Suddenly, the power goes out during the movie. The boy's grandfather, who's watching the boy while his parents are out, explains that he used to write for television, and that the Merlin stories were intended to form the basis of a TV series, each episode of which would feature an item obtained from Merlin's shop bringing a little magic into people's lives. Although the opening segment implies that Merlin's magical interventions in people's lives are intended to have a benign effect, in practice this proves to be far from the case. The first story focuses on a married couple, Jonathan and Madeline Cooper. Jonathan is a respected, though obnoxious columnist, and Madeline is desperate for a baby, as she and Jonathan have been unable to conceive. The couple visit the store, where Jonathan berates Merlin and threatens to write a negative article in the newspaper that will cause his readers to avoid the store, to Madeline's chagrin. Merlin loans Jonathan his spell book as proof that he is actually the legendary wizard. Jonathan takes the book home and begins to toy with several of the spells. Jonathan becomes convinced of the book's authenticity when an unsuccessful spell to summon a spirit results in breathing fire. Jonathan quickly grows excited and becomes obsessed with the book's powers, but begins to dramatically age due to the rapid depletion of one's life force required to cast the spells. Jonathan attempts to transform his pet cat into a mystical servant, but it becomes demonic and proceeds to attack him. Using the spell from earlier, Jonathan breathes fire and burns the cat alive. By then, Jonathan has aged so severely that his hair is white and receded. Jonathan retrieves the book's rejuvenation spell and proceeds to create the required potion. He takes a sample of Madeline's blood and adds it to the mixture. Jonathan drinks the potion, but the spell backfires: Jonathan regresses into infancy. Madeline happily decides to raise her former husband as her own child. The second story then starts off with a thief stealing a toy mechanical monkey from Merlin's shop and selling it to a novelty store, where it is quickly bought as a birthday present for a young boy. Merlin discovers its theft and begins trying to track the monkey down, as its magic can be very dangerous in the wrong hands. The monkey strikes its cymbals on its own accord; each time they are struck, a nearby living thing dies. The monkey causes the death of several houseplants, the boy's goldfish, and the family dog. The boy's father learns that the toy is possessed by an evil spirit, and numerous attempts to remove it from the house fail. Before the monkey nearly causes the death of the boy and his family, Merlin appears and recovers the toy. After the stories, the boy listening to the stories falls asleep and his grandfather tucks him in. We then see Merlin closing up his shop for the night.
