In the movie, Mr. Warren—a sales manager at a Chevrolet automobile dealership-is talking to his father about the men he hired. He complains that Jimmy and Henderson are not working out very well as salesmen. Warren's father tells him that he didn't do much better in the beginning when Harry hired him—that he made all kinds of mistakes. Warren remembers how closely Harry worked with him, and stressed to him the importance of prospects. His father asks if he has done that for the men working for him. Warren responds that he was too busy, and his father tells him that Harry wasn't too busy to help him out at first. Warren thought that Harry helped him because of Harry's friendship with his father, but his father says that Harry helped everyone who came to work for him. Warren's father swats at insects while talking to his son, but these insects are not visible to the viewer. The father responds to the insect attack by taking a handkerchief from his pocket and draping it over his head.  Warren realizes that he hasn't done a very good job of helping his men, and that for them to improve he will have to work closely with his staff. He begins working with each of his men much more closely than he had been—Jimmy in particular. Warren passes on the lessons he learned over the years, and soon finds that his men are doing much better selling cars.
