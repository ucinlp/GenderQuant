Christine and Murray meet again in England and their attraction grows. The two couples plan to vacation together in Greece. Sam must stay home because of a family illness. Murray and Christine fall in love as they visit Greek ruins and other tourist attractions. Sibyl realizes what is happening and writes Sam in New York.

She tells Christine “he’s all yours.” Hearing that Christine’s controlling mother is pursuing them, they continue their travels, eventually making love.
