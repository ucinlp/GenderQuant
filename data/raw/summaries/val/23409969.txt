Inspector Sunil Rana  has been assigned the case of triple-homicide of the Sinha family, namely Mr. Sinha ; his son Inspector Rohan , and Rohan's wife . After an investigation, Sunil concludes that the assailant can only be Dr. Singh , who escapes from India, and re-locates to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, far from the jurisdiction of Bombay Police. Sunil must overcome borders to apprehend Dr. Singh, and thus bring justice to the Sinha family. It is then Sunil comes to know that Dr. Singh is not the only one involved in this homicide, which is far more complicated that he had thought it to be so.
