Housewife Christine M. tries to shoplift some merchandise but is caught by the male shopkeeper. Christine and two other customers, waitress Annie and secretary Anna, beat the man to death. They are tried with murder and deny the plea of insanity that the male prosecutor and judges assume they should plead. The criminal psychiatrist assigned to ascertain their level of sanity identifies with the women's motives and concludes that they are not insane but have been driven to murder by the strain of living in a patriarchy. {{Cite news}}
