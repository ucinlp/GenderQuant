Satya's girlfriend  is accidentally wounded in a shootout between Adhi's gang and his rivals. Satya, on the prodding of ACP Thiagarajan  is all set to identify Kutty as the culprit. Intimidated and threatened by the gang, and in a state of confusion, Satya is shocked when Adhi suddenly changes track, makes friendly overtures to Satya, claiming kinship with him.
