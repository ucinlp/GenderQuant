Anil , a street performer and wedding singer, is scarred by the memory of the rich P.N. Oberoi  beating his mother  in an incident during his childhood. When David Brown, the manager  of current Indian disco champion Sam  is fed up and looks for some new talent, he happens across Anil who is dance-walking down a street. Rebranded as "Jimmy", the rising disco star must take the throne from Sam and win the heart of Rita , P.N. Oberoi's daughter. All seems to be going well until Oberoi hires men to connect Jimmy's electric guitar to 5,000 volts of electricity, causing Jimmy's mother to die in a tragic accident. With his legs broken by Oberoi's goons and guitar phobia from the incident with his mother, Jimmy must claim first place for Team India at the International Disco Dancing Competition amidst strong competition from Team Africa and Team Paris.
