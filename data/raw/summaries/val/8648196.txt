Leigh-Anne Williams's mother committed suicide when she was a child, and she and her brother both suffered abuse at the hands of their father. Leigh-Anne is very protective towards her baby daughter Rebecca, and still has visits from Rebecca's father's mother  - though Leigh-Anne gets angry when Annette suggests that Rebecca would be better off in her care. The father of her baby is in prison , while Leanne's family is similarly dysfunctional; her mother committed suicide, while her abusive father went on to marry her mother's sister. As well as Gavin, she has a sister in her early teens and a baby sister from her father's marriage to her aunt. Despite being less than 20 years old, Leigh-Anne has made quite a few significant enemies in her local area. She is involved in constant confrontations with her Turkish Muslim neighbour Hassan Osman, and is so desperate to support her baby that she will committ the most shocking acts. One notable act is when she tricks a man out of Â£30 by pretending to be a pimp. She then gets a younger girl  to have sex with the man, who is much older. Three of the few people who have good relationships with Leigh-Anne are her brother Gavin, and Gavin's friends Robbie and Stephen. But they are actively involved in crime and anti-social behaviour, and Leigh-Anne is a willing participant in many of their crimes. She receives regular visits from a social worker, and fears that Rebecca will be taken away from her. Leigh-Anne then sees her social worker talking with Hassan Osman, and believes that Hassan is trying to get Rebecca taken into care. Leigh-Anne, Gavin, Robbie and Stephen are at a library one day when they come across Hassan Osman and his daughter Julie, who is an ex-girlfriend of Gavin's - their relationship was effectively ended by Hassan's disapproval. An argument starts as they leave the centre and it turns into a full scale street fight in which the three boys attack Hassan while Leigh-Anne looks on. The story ends when Leigh-Anne returns home and gets a visit from the police, who want to question her in connection with an attack on Hassan Osman - he had died as a result of the beating. She goes to the police station with them and as they are leaving the house, her three friends are also been taken away - Robbie still wearing the bloodstained jumper that he wore during the attack. The very end of the film sees Leigh-Anne crying uncontrollably in police custody after her daughter has been handed over to Social Services, and her own social worker has informed her that nobody ever wanted to remove her daughter from her, and that the reason she spoke to Hassan Osman was about his own daughter's issues. Meanwhile, Julie reveals to the police that she is pregnant with Gavin's baby.
