During the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, teachers at a secluded countryside elementary school are asked to walk their pupils home after a nuclear bomb warning alarm sounds. Unaware that the alarm was tripped by accident, the teacher and children walk through the countryside with a slowly building sense of doom about the upcoming nuclear holocaust. When the children finally gain access to a bomb shelter, they do not allow a female fellow student join them, claiming there isn't enough room. The girl frantically searches for shelter and finds an abandoned old refrigerator to hide inside, suggesting that she is going to suffocate to death . After a boy from the shelter fails to find her, we hear a loud whining noise overhead. The boy cowers in the shadow of planes passing in the sky above. The film abruptly smashes to black with the words "STOP! STOP! STOP!" written on screen. It is left unclear whether or not a bomb is dropped, or the children simply are victims of the panic and paranoia caused by the Cold War.
