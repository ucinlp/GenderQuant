Speedy Gonzales invades Granny's home and drives Sylvester to a nervous breakdown. Concerned about the welfare of her cat, Granny calls on the Jet Age Pest Control to remove the rodent. Daffy Duck is assigned the job. When conventional traps fail, the determined Daffy decides to use a series of contraptions to capture Speedy. However, Speedy is always one step ahead of the duck, and Daffy winds up getting the worst of his machinery. The final attempt sees Daffy try to program a robot with a card featuring Speedy's picture, but Speedy grabs a Daffy Duck comic book and fools the robot. The robot is seen chasing Daffy out of the house as Speedy watches.
