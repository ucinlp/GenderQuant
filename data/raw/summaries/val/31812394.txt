Oswald is a hair stylist and runs a barber shop. His first customer is a shaggy terrier, and Oswald goes to give it a haircut. Every time Oswald shaves some hair from the terrier's back, the hair kept regrowing. In time, Oswald found out that the little dog has been drinking a bottle of hair-growing liquid while he was shaving. He then took away the bottle and continued working. Though all he intended to is to give the terrier a little trimming, Oswald made the dog almost completely hairless. His second customer is a hippo who came to have some chin shaving which Oswald provided easily. The next patron is an elephant who seems to need a trunk makeover. Oswald ironed the elephant's trunk and curled it with some tongs. The elephant blew its trunk like a party horn and appears to be satisfied by it. Oswald then came to a bear who arrived to have a manicure. To make himself more charming, Oswald puts on a skirt and some lipstick. He then smoothed the bear's sharp claws with an automatic nail-filing wheel. Because of the feminine outfit the rabbit was wearing, the bear thought Oswald was a girl and therefore falls in love with him. Oswald was then asked by the love-stricken bear to have a ride in the latter's car but Oswald declined. To make the rabbit get in, the bear lured Oswald using a lollipop. The plan worked and Oswald was in the vehicle sitting beside his client. They went off in the car, leaving the barber shop and exiting the city. While they were riding through an open field minutes later, the bear picks up Oswald with two hands and starts kissing the rabbit constantly, much to Oswald's dismay. Oswald was able to get out of the bear's grasp and jumps off the car. Oswald goes on running with the bear in the car chasing. The chase continued even when night had fallen. It ended when they came across a long fence. Having enough of the bear's affection, Oswald confesses he is actually a guy as he takes off his skirt and wipes off the lipstick. The bear was disgusted and drives away. Oswald is finally left in peace.
