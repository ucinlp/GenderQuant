The film takes place in a period of six days, with footage from a fictional pop group "Dessert" opening the movie, and closing during the credits. Tokyo, May 27th, 54 teenage schoolgirls commit mass suicide by throwing themselves in front of an oncoming train. Shortly after, at a hospital, two nurses commit suicide by jumping out of a window. At both locations rolls of flesh are found, with the missing skin matching removed flesh on corpses. Three detectives - Kuroda , Shibusawa , and Murata , are notified by a hacker named Kiyoko  of a link between the suicides and a website, which shows the number of suicides via red and white circles. May 28, at a high school, a group of students jump off the roof during a lunch break, due to an escalating series of events, sending the city in search of a "Suicide Club". On May 29, the suicide boom has spread all over Japan. Mitsuko  is on her way home when she gets hit by her boyfriend, Masa, who has thrown himself off a roof. Mitsuko is taken to the police station for questioning, where the police strip search Mitsuko and discover that she has a butterfly tattoo. On May 30, the police receive a call from a boy who warns that on that evening at 7:30, another mass suicide will take place at the same platform. The detectives organize a stake-out in order to prevent another mass suicide, but there is no suicide. Meanwhile, the individual and smaller-scale group suicides continue all over Japan, claiming many lives, including Kuroda's entire family. He gets a call from the boy who warned them about the second suicide wave, at which point, upon the conversations conclusion, Kuroda shoots himself. Meanwhile, Kiyoko is caught by a group led by a costumed man named Genesis whose hideout is a small subterranean bowling alley, where he resides with four glam-rock cohorts. During her capture, Genesis performs a song while stomping to death dogs and cats bound in white sacks. At Genesis' lair, Kiyoko e-mails the authorities information about her whereabouts. The police arrest Genesis and it is assumed the "Suicide Club" is caught. On June 1, Mitsuko goes to her boyfriend's home to return his helmet, where she notices the Dessert posters on the wall and recognizes a pattern. Soon, the boy from earlier calls her to tell her there is no "Suicide Club" and to invite her to a secret concert. On June 2, Mitsuko sneaks into the backstage area, where she wanders onto a stage. She sees a group of children in the audience, who ask her a series of questions. Mitsuko impresses the children, so they take her to a room where a strip from her skin is shaved off, where the butterfly-tattoo is located. A new roll of skin ends up with the police, which detective Shibusawa recognizes as "a little bit Mitsuko". That evening he sees Mitsuko as she is standing at the Train Station. As the train pulls out of the station, the credits roll.
