Gigi, Jerome, Christiane, Jean-Claude, and Bernard visit a resort in the Ivory Coast, the Club Med village of Assinie. Bernard subsequently meets up with his wife, Nathalie, who has already spent a week there, and they are all welcomed by Popeye and the eccentric emcees, Bobo and Bourseault. The film follows the humorous couplings and uncouplings of the group, and especially Popeye's attempt to seduce record numbers of women.
