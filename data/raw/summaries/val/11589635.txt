{{Plot|dateMc3  is shown on a blackboard and Tom is seen making a large quantity of explosive potion based on it, hoping that it will annihilate Jerry once and for all once installed into the bomb. The camera cuts to Jerry, who sees Tom on his monitor, and is compressing the wheel of cheese into a tiny amount of a highly volatile liquid. He fills a projectile with it, flies nabove Tom in a gunboat, and drops the microbomb into the potion. Tom quizzically points into the vat....and then a big explosion occurs. When the smoke clears, time has reversed itself to the Stone Age because of Jerry's intervention of the highly explosive liquid. Tom, who is now a cavecat walks out of a cave with a club and soon sees Jerry, also a cavemouse and licking on a bone. He attempts to whack the mouse, but Jerry shows him the bone, which they share. As they both share it Tom accidentally licks Jerry and then goes "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!" before he tries to eat Jerry, who escapes from Tom, who then begins another chase, which causes the viewers to think that the chase is the last chase from the future  and the first chase in the Stone Age as "THE END" is shown, and then three question marks pop up as if to say, "...or only the beginning?"
