The film begins in Los Angeles, CA in 1962. It is narrated by the oldest son, Shayne Patrick Lacey. The family is very poor, and living in a small apartment. Frances Lacey, a widow, works at a factory. She is fired when one of the men gropes her, and she hits him in return. The same day, her son is brought home by the police, for stealing change from payphones, but they don't press charges. Shortly after this, Frances decides that LA is not the place to raise a family. She packs the kids up, sells everything they can't carry, and starts driving. She figures she'll know where she's going when she sees it. When the car breaks down, Frances trades her wedding ring to pay for the repairs. She claims it does not have sentimental value, and calls her husband a "no good, vagabond, Irish Catholic son-of-a-bitch." However, she is clearly upset about giving the ring away. When they finally stop, in Idaho, it's because she has seen the house she wants for her family. It's a shack, really, and a half-built one at that; but she sees potential there. The owner of the property, Mr. Munimura, is reluctant to sell, especially because the Lacey family clearly has no money, but Frances is stubborn and persuades him. She offers to clean his dishes and wash his laundry and have her children do any other chores for him. He reluctantly agrees, but soon finds joy in helping the family build up the little house. He eventually tells Frances that the house was supposed to be for his son and daughter-in-law. He never finished it though, because his son died in the Korean war. Shayne gets a Love Interest, although she does have a Boyfriend at the time. One of the boys, Murray, has gotten a job helping a man who owns a salvage shop. He gets used items, like couches, or French doors, in return for his work, and brings home any items that can help with the building of the house. All of the Lacey tribe are helping to improve the home, but when their youngest brother falls from a rafter onto on a nail one day while Mr. Munimura is fetching Frances from town, Shayne has to carry his brother halfway to the hospital, before meeting them on the road. Eventually Frances gets a job as a waitress at the local bowling alley, where she is very happy, and here the townspeople get to know the Lacey Family. When school starts, the family goes to the local church to buy clothes. The priest tries to get them to come to Sunday services, but they are not very religious. He also offers Frances weekly food donations and other assistance, but she refuses. She is too proud to accept charity, especially from someone who is condescending to her. She gets most upset when he specifically calls her family "needy," even though they are. The children have trouble at school because their clothes are obviously second hand, and some of them are handmade. Shane is not allowed to participate in gym because he needs a white shirt, and his only one got dyed pink in the wash by accident. When Christmas rolls around, Frances tells the children that they should all ask Santa for presents for the house instead of toys. They write the letter, but Shane is certain that Frances has plans to get them some real presents anyway. Lynn knits socks for her mother, and the other children buy her a shirt that she liked from the church. The priest comes to their door on Christmas Eve and offers Frances presents for the "needy family." Again, she refuses his help. On Christmas morning, all they have are tools and nails instead of toys. The children really thought they would get something more and begin to cry. Shane gets very upset and tells his mother that all she cares about is the stupid house, and not about her children. Mr. Munimura comes over, just as she is about to hit Shane with the belt. He takes her to town to see if the church has any presents left, but there are none. The same night that Shane goes on his first date, Frances goes out with Norm, one of the men who works at the bowling alley who has taken her dancing a few times. He takes her to a motel, but Frances is offended at his presumption and refuses him. He tries to force her inside, grabbing her arm, and says that he can make her do what he wants. She says "You can try," and the scene cuts to when Shayne is returning home from the dance, where he finds Frances sitting in the car in the snowy front yard. Shayne sees she is crying and has a cut lip and bloody nose. Inside he helps to clean her up, and they talk about Shayne's father. She tells Shane that his father was a great man, and he was never mean to her; but ever since he died, she has only been able to find bastards who want to take advantage of her. The next day, Shayne goes to the Bowling Alley and sees Norm flirting with another woman. Shayne tackles him, accusing him of beating his mother, and the two fight as the townspeople call for the Sheriff. Norm pushes Shane into the bathroom, where Shane asks him how he got the scratches on his face. Norm responds that she fights like her son, punches Shayne, and storms out. Later, Frances arrives at the bowling alley to tell her boss that she has to quit, because of what he did to her and her son. The boss tells her that Norm has been fired, and that if he was the only problem, then he hopes she has no reason to quit. One day Murray brings home an indoor toilet, from his job at the salvage shop. The family is excited, because they have been using an out house. The next day, the boys decide to burn down the outhouse. A spark catches the canvas roof of their home. The entire thing burns to the ground. The fire department arrived too late to do anything. The family is picking through the remains of the house, salvaging nails and whatever else they can, when Mr. Munimura comes driving up. Behind him are lots of people from town. They are there to build the Lacey family a house whether Frances likes it or not. She says they can help, but she will pay all of them back. They also bring toys, clothes, and blankets for the children. Frances only lets them build the house as far as it was before the fire. Shane, narrating, says that it took them six months to finish the rest of the house, and four years to pay everyone back, but that it brought them all closer together as a family. Even though he hated Idaho at first, he still lives there, and has never been back to LA.
