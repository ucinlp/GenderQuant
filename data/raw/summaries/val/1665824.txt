Harry Moseby is a retired professional football player working as a private investigator in Los Angeles. He is dedicated to his job, but his dedication does not make him happy or powerful in his personal life, and his wife Ellen is unfaithful to him. Aging actress Arlene Iverson hires Harry to find her trust-funded daughter Delly Grastner, distracting Harry from his marital problems as he tracks the lascivious runaway teen to Florida. In the Florida Keys, Harry has an affair of his own with Paula, and succeeds in locating Delly, even as he learns that finding her is only the beginning of a much larger case. As the "accidental" deaths multiply, Harry discovers that everyone has his or her own motives and that he cannot do much to stem the tide of deep-seated depravity.  The most quoted line from Night Moves occurs when Moseby declines an invitation from his wife to see the movie My Night at Maud's: "I saw a Rohmer film once. It was kinda like watching paint dry."<ref nameLoose Ends in Night Moves |firstJackson |authorlinkSenses of Cinema |issueJuly 11, 2010 |urlKehr |firstDave Kehr |workÃ‰ric Rohmer, a Leading Filmmaker of the French New Wave, Dies at 89 |datehttp://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/movies/12rohmer.html}} Penn himself is an admirer of Rohmer's films;{{cite book |last1Arthur |last2Michael |last3Paul |titleUniv.
