Wilbur Hoolick, a barber's apprentice, doesn't have enough money for train fare. Wilbur pretends to be an eleven-year-old in order to purchase a ticket for half price. Meanwhile, a valuable diamond has been stolen and the thief hides it in Hoolick's pocket without his knowledge. On the train, Wilbur gets the impression that the thief is a jealous husband. He hides in the compartment of Nancy Collins, a teacher at a private girl's school. Feeling sorry for "young" Wilbur traveling alone, she allows him to stay there for the duration of the train ride. During a stop-over, another teacher, Gretchen Brendan, boards the train and finds out that Nancy is sharing her compartment with "a man." Gretchen hurries to the school to let Nancy's fiancee, Bob Miles, in on this news. In order to protect Nancy's job and reputation, Wilbur must continue the charade of pretending to be a child. He accompanies "Aunt Nancy" to school. The jewel thief follows them in order to retrieve the stolen diamond. Along the way, Wilbur falls in love with Nancy, although she still thinks of him as a little boy. Eventually the thief retrieves the jewel and a chase ensues. In the end he is captured and Wilbur's identity is revealed.
