With the end of Prohibition, bootlegger Remy Marko becomes a legitimate brewer, but slowly goes broke because the beer he makes tastes terrible and everyone is afraid to tell him so. After four years, with bank officers preparing to foreclose on the brewery, he retreats to his Saratoga summer home, only to find four dead mobsters who meant to ambush him, but were killed by their confederate whom they meant to betray. More and more problems begin to pop up in the life of the former bootlegger, as he's taken in a bratty orphan, and his daughter comes home with a fianc√© that turns out to be a state cop.
