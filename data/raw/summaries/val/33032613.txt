A foreigner, Von Haeke, seduces a mine-owner's daughter in order to gain access to her house and her father's money. He is about to marry the girl when his deserted wife arrives and exposes him. In revenge, Von Haeke induces the miners to go on strike, abducts the gig and imprisons her in a mineshaft which is flooded. The hero, Jack, arrives in time to save the girl and beats Von Haeke in a fight. Von Haeke falls to his death from a cliff and Jack marries the girl.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900â€“1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, p33
