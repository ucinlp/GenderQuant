Ben Murphy receives a letter in the post informing him that he is in line to inherit a small fortune, all he has to do is call the number. The film was based on an actual event&mdash;a case of identity fraud. A letter had been sent to a person, by a man claiming to be a representative of an Asian bank. In the letter, this representative claimed that he had a sum of money, "which needed to claimed". This letter also listed various personal details of this persons' deceased father. Although the person, in this case, did not make the call, or take any further action, the writers decided to use his experiences and a number of other reported International Identity fraud cases to set up a "What if..." storyline.
