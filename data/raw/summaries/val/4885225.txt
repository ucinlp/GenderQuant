Rooney plays Billy Coy, a young man determined to follow in his father's footsteps as a race car driver. Despite the fact that his father, "Cannonball" Coy, was killed in a fiery crash during the Indianapolis 500, Billy is undaunted and manages to work his way up from race mechanic to top driver. The story follows him through the ups and downs of the racing life, from nightclub shenanigans to dragout brawls, with hairpin turns on the track in between. At one point, he's involved in a race crash, and is under suspicion for causing another driver's death. All the while the adoration of a racecar owner's daughter  and the love of his mother  sees Billy through his many trials. Billy eventually earns his way back onto the racing circuit, and lands a spot in the field at the "500". In the final laps, Billy drives through a wall of fire, caused by another driver's crash, and with his own car in flames, manages to finish third, but seriously burns his arms. Inspired by his determination and sportsmanship, the winning driver turns the famous Borg-Warner Trophy over to Billy.
