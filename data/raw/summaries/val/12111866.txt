The film is based loosely around events in December 1995 that culminated in the murders of two top drug barons and their driver in Rettendon, Essex, UK. On 6 December 1995, Patrick Tate, Craig Rolfe and Tony Tucker, three drug dealers well known to the police, were lured to Workhouse Lane, Rettendon on the pretext of a lucrative drug deal. There they were killed by shotgun blasts to the head while sitting in their Range Rover. The bodies were found the following morning. This scene and other details of the 1990s Essex and London criminal milieu are also featured in the film Rise of the Footsoldier . Two men, Jack Whomes and Michael Steele, were convicted of the murders after police informer Darren Nicholls gave evidence against his former friends at their Old Bailey trial. They have always protested their innocence. There are three other movies based on the Rettendon Range Rover murders: 2007's Rise of the Footsoldier, 2010's Bonded by Blood and upcoming 2013 release The Fall of the Essex Boys.
