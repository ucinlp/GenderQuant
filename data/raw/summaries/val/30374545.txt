One day in the lives of three young men from the same neighborhood in İzmir’s Bornova district. Hakan  is a young man who spends his entire day in front of the neighborhood’s grocery shop with Salih , thinking, “If we were just given the chance…” Salih, the neighborhood’s psychopathic rogue, is like an older brother to Hakan, who has just returned home after completing his mandatory military service. Hakan does not have a job, but he plans to become a taxi driver to be able to realize all he wants in this life: to earn just enough money to be able to decently look after a small family and to marry the girl he secretly adores. Salih is the only person who listens to Hakan and gives him advice. Although Salih has grown up in a respectable, educated family, he’s involved in every kind of illegal business in the neighborhood. Everybody in the neighborhood is scared of him, including high school student Özlem . Hakan is crazy about Özlem, but he never had the courage to talk to her in person. In the meantime, Murat , Salih’s childhood friend and a doctoral student in philosophy, makes a living through writing erotic fantasies. He tells Hakan about an erotic fantasy that he wrote based on an event involving Salih and Özlem. Disappointed and confused, Hakan heads toward Özlem’s house to learn about the whole thing.
