Martha Horgan  struggles to have a normal life in spite of being mentally challenged. She is fired from a job at the local dry-cleaner's after accusations of stealing from the cash register, something she believes the boyfriend of her work colleague Birdie  has been doing. Depressed, she returns to the home of Aunt Frances  and discovers that a handyman , looking for work in any capacity, has been hired to fix the porch of the main house before the residence hosts a gala event for a local politician. The politician's wife  has damaged the porch by driving a car into it, irate over her husband's affair with Frances. Mackey, the handyman, is kind to Martha, offering her a ride into town as well as defending her from Birdie's boyfriend Getso , a bully who insults her, by breaking the windshield on Getso's van. Martha becomes increasingly fond of Mackey as time goes on. Mack recognizes Martha's feelings but he honorably abstains from engaging in sexual intercourse. One night, however, Mack returns to Martha's home drunk, lets himself in and proceeds to initiate coitus with a more than willing Martha on her couch. He later sleeps with Martha's aunt, who is drunk and despondent following the gala, during which her love interest, the local politician, reconciles and leaves with his ex-wife. Mack leaves as soon as the porch job is done, feeling guilt of being unfaithful to Martha. Still desperate to clear her name at work, Martha proceeds alone to enter the home of Birdie, her former co-worker. Getso is there. He confronts Martha and attempts to shoo her away before he calls the police. Martha feels cornered and stabs Getso to death with a sandwich knife.
