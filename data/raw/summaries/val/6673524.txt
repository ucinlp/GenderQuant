Rajaram , owner of a fleet of lorries, meets Devi , a garment factory owner. After that acquaintance, she once seeks his help in dealing with two street ruffians, who were teasing her sisters, Lata  and Geeta , and is shocked when the culprits turn out to be his brothers, Ravi  and Gopi . Rajaram takes the incident lightly as the pranks of youngsters and is very lenient to them. With more such incidents, the two fall in love, with the brothers and sisters not far behind. On his brothers' request, Rajaram approaches Devi for her sisters' hands in marriage to his brothers. But she curtly refuses her consent on grounds that the two are wayward drunkards. Rajaram reacts sharply to it and vows to get his brothers married to her sisters. Since then on he is more exacting with his brothers and brings about a transformation in them. Devi agrees to their marriage. But the incorrigible brothers come in an inebriated condition for their engagement and Rajaram faces the brunt of Devi's ire. She insults him and leaves with her sisters. An outraged Rajaram kicks his brothers out of home. The two brothers being state rank holders in engineering find favor with a businessman, Rangarao , who employs them. Rajaram, who is genuinely fond of his brothers, sells away his property and gives money secretly to Rangarao, paving way for a partnership deal between Rangarao and his brothers. Piqued at being kicked out of home, his brothers, unaware of his hand in securing the partnership for them, nurse grudge against their brother and insult Rajaram in Devi's presence. She, being in the know, slaps them and opens their eyes by informing them of his sacrifice. This brings about a total change in them and the repentant duo go to Rangarao to restore the property to their brother. Rangarao has other plans and tries to get them killed with gundas. The brothers escape death and land in a hospital with injuries. A furious Rajaram goes to Rangarao, who reveals his real identity. Rangarao is the brother of Chinna Rao , a criminal who was caught in the police dragnet with Rajaram's help and later died. This is Rangarao's vendetta. In the ensuing melee, Rangarao gets killed.
