Aggie Bruno has had enough of her husband, Joe, and decides to get a divorce in Reno. She meets with lawyers Wattles and Swift, the latter of the two agreeing to represent Aggie in court. Swift suggests that Aggie be "caught" with another man. Meanwhile, Joe Bruno has also headed to Reno, and is being represented in court by Wattles. Wattles suggests that Joe be "caught" with another woman. Meanwhile, an angry Arizona gambler wants to shoot Wattles for representing the gambler's wife in a previous divorce case.

That evening, Wattles and Swift do the same thing that they do every evening: turn their office into a casino. Swift arrives at the casino pretending to be Aggie Bruno's love interest. To add to the confusion, Waddles  shows up with Joe Bruno, pretending to be his love interest.
