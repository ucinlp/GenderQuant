All but abandoned by her family in a London retirement hotel, Mrs Palfrey  strikes up a curious friendship with a young writer, Ludovic Meyer . Fate brings them together after she has an accident outside his basement flat. The two newly found friends discover they have a lot more in common with each other than they do with other people their own age. Ludovic inadvertently leads Mrs. Palfrey through her past; Mrs. Palfrey inadvertently leads Ludovic to his future. The 1945 British film Brief Encounter figures into the plot, as does Beaulieu Castle.
