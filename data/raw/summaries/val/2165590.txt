John W. "Jack" Burns  works as a roaming ranch hand much as the cowboys of the old West did, refusing to join modern society. He rejects much of modern technology, not even carrying any identification such as a driver's license or draft card. He can't provide an address because he just sleeps wherever he finds a place. As Burns crosses a highway into town, his horse Whiskey has a difficult time crossing the road, confused and scared by the traffic. They enter town to visit Jerry . She is the wife of an old friend, Paul Bondi ([[Michael Kane , who has been jailed for giving aid to illegal immigrants. Jack explains his dislike for a society that restricts a man on where he can or can't go, what he can or can't do. After a violent barroom fight against a one-armed man in which he chooses to use only one arm himself, Burns is arrested. When the police decide to let him go, he deliberately punches a cop to get himself arrested. He is immediately sentenced to a year in jail, which allows him to see Bondi with the goal to help him escape. The town is a sleepy border town and the cops are mostly bored, occasionally dealing with minor offenses. The Sheriff has to compel them to pay attention to their duties at times. During the course of the story, the seemingly unrelated progress of a tractor-trailer truck carrying toilets, driven by Carroll O'Connor, is intercut with the principal events. Joining Bondi in jail, Burns tries to persuade him to escape. He tells Bondi he couldn't spend a year in jail because he'd probably kill someone. Burns defends Bondi from the attention of sadistic Deputy Sheriff Gutierrez , and the deputy picks Burns as his next target. During the night they saw through one of the jail's bars using two hacksaw blades Burns hid in his boot. The deputy summons Burns from his cell in the middle of the night and beats him. Upon returning to his cell, Burns tries to persuade Bondi to join him in escaping, but Bondi has a family and too much at stake to become a fugitive from the law, so he refuses to go. Burns breaks out by himself and returns to Bondi's house where he picks up his horse and some food from Bondi's wife. After the jail break, the Sheriff learns that Burns served in the military during the Korean War, including 7 months in a disciplinary training center for striking a superior officer. He also received a Purple Heart and a Distinguished Service Cross with oak leaf clusters for his valor during battle. He heads for the mountains on horseback with the goal to cross the border into Mexico. The police mount an extensive search, with Sheriff Johnson  and his Deptuty Sheriff Harry  following him in a jeep. A military helicopter is brought in to help find Burns. When the air crew locates Burns, they relay his location to the Sheriff and attempt to bring Burns in. Whisky is repeatedly spooked by the helicopter and other modern noises. Burns shoots the tail rotor of the aircraft, damaging it and causing the pilot to lose control and crash land. Deputy Gutierrez also chases Burns. He sees Burn's horse and thinks he has Burns fixed in place. He is preparing to shoot him when Burns sneaks up on him and disarms him, knocking him unconscious with the his rifle butt. Burns leads his horse up impossibly difficult, steep, rocky slopes to escape the pursuit, but the lawmen keep on his trail, forcing him to keep moving. Surrounded on three sides by lawmen closing in, his horse refuses at first to climb a steep slope. They finally surmount the crest of the Sandia Moountains and escape into the east side of the mountains, a broad stand of heavy timber with the lawmen, including Deputy Gutierrez, shooting at him. The Sheriff acknowledges that Burns has evaded their attempts to capture him. Burns is shot through the ankle during his dash to the timber. Burns appears to have escaped the law and his trackers late at night when he tries to cross Highway 66 in Tijeras Canyon during a heavy rainstorm. His horse is spooked, confused by noise of the traffic and blinded by the lights. The truck driver with a load of toilets, his vision impaired by the rain, strikes Burns and his horse as they attempt to cross the road. The sheriff arrives and is asked if Burns is the man he has been looking for. The sheriff says he can't identify him because he's never seen the man he was looking for up close. Whisky, who is seriously wounded, is killed by Harry with a gunshot. The Sheriff and his deputy Harry head home, and Burns is transported from the scene in an ambulance. The movie closes with a view of Burn's cowboy hat swamped by rain in the middle of the highway.
