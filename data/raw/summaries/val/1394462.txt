One year after the final battle between Gappelnitch and the Macross 7 fleet in 2045 ended in a victory for the Macross 7, the fleet continues its journey into deep space whilst undergoing major repair work. During that time, Firebomber had held what was to be their largest, and final concert, before Basara Nekki left Macross 7 and the band behind, with his guitar as a constant companion, on a journey around the galaxy leaving behind nothing more than a letter for the band.  During his journey, he stops on a planet named "Zola", which is inhabited by a race of humanoid marsupials called the Zolan. While staying there, he becomes involved in a battle between galactic space whale poachers and the Zola Patrol . After being injured, he is taken into the care of a young Zolan girl named Elma Hollie, who has a sister, Liza, that works for the Zola Patrol. Her father, Graham Hollie, is also a whale poacher. Graham and his wife Maria Hollie, a very popular singer on Zola, would go hunting whales in their Valkyrie, and Maria would also sing to the whales while they hunted. However, Maria lost her life and Graham lost an arm after encountering the legendary Great White Galactic Whale. After the event, Graham swore revenge on the Great White Whale for taking his wife and his arm and underwent Macronization to become large enough to take it on. Back on Macross 7, Mylene Jenius is left as the lead singer of Firebomber and is also concentrating on a solo career. She still has unresolved feelings for Basara, and her relationship with Gamlin Kizaki hasn't advanced any further beyond a close friendship. The people around Mylene clearly see that it is interfering with her performances and Gamlin soon decides to search for Basara's Song Energy in the hopes of bringing him back.
