Gene Loomis  and his brother Dennis  live on a military base in Key West, Florida; their father is away onboard one of the nearby submarines. After leaving the announcement of an exclusive engagement of Lawrence Woolsey's  Mant!, including Woolsey's appearance in-person, they arrive home to John F. Kennedy's television interruption, stating the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba. Woolsey finds this atmosphere of fear to be the perfect environment in which to open his film, Mant! in Atomo-Vision and Rumble-Rama. Woolsey brings along Herb Denning  and Bob  to stir up the yokels by protesting the film, but Howard, the theatre manager , assures him that "the people of Key West are not yokels". Indeed, the progressive Jack and Rhonda  find a strong free speech argument in allowing the film to proceed. New to the local high school, and not getting along with the similarly-aged Andy  on the base, Gene ends up associating with Stan , and becomes infatuated with Jack and Rhonda's daughter, Sandra , after she takes a detention for protesting the uselessness of an air raid drill and yelling the truth of the faux protection at the students in the hall. In attempting to get a date to the dance, Stan goes for Sherry , who was seeing a prison poet, Harvey Starkweather , who regularly bothers Stan about his interest in her . The film is structured in halves: the first half leading up to the screening, and the second half depicting the screening and what goes on at and around it. The film also showed the differences in two young women who would eventually become the girlfriends of the two boys in the film. The girlfriend of Gene had more progressive ideas of what a woman might become, whereas the eventual girlfriend of Stan was more in line with what society at the time of the film thought a young lady should be. The film also includes scenes from Mant!  that sharply skewer cheap 1950s sci-fi and horror flicks.
