David Martinaud is an accountant who leaves town for the weekends on the pretense that he is going to the old age home to care for his aging parents, who are in fact dead. He is really fixing up a chalet, where he intends to move in with Lise, who he has loved since childhood. However, Lise is just married to another and has a child, but this does not stop the warped and depressed David from pursuing his dream, which is motivated by a deep-seeted feeling of sexual inadequacy.
