Toorop , an American mercenary, narrates that the world is not really worth saving, as we try to save it from ourselves. He says that every man is one day presented by a choice; A choice to make a difference, or to walk away and save himself. He explains that on that day, he learned something, to make a difference. He finishes: "Too bad it was the day I died," as the camera shows him in New York City, slowly dying from a gunshot wound, as a caricature and an explosion is seen in his eye, as the scene blacks out. Six days earlier, in the year 2019, Toorop is shown living in New Serbia. Branded a terrorist, he is forbidden from returning to the United States, as he lived his life transporting immigrants around Eastern Europe to Western, and he makes a living working odd jobs, living his life in a small flat in dystopian city of Belgrade. One day, he is offered a courier contract by a Russian mobster, Gorsky . Toorop accepts in return for a chance to return to the United States, as he will be given an unfakeable U.N. passport  and $500,000 in cash. Gorsky instructs him to take a young woman, an orphan known only as Aurora , to New York City. He is provided with weapons, maps, and money to secure passage. Toorop travels by a reinforced armored car on an industrial lifting electromagnet hoisted by an Mil Mi-24 gunship. The helicopter drops the car off near a thousand-year old convent in Kyrgyzstan, now occupied by a new religion sect known as the Noelites. There he picks up a Noelite nun named Sister Rebeka  and her charge, Aurora. They travel by car to Troitsk in the border between Kazakhstan and Russia. In Troitsk, Toorop purchases tickets for a train to Vladivostok. When trying to board the train, Aurora inexplicably panics and flees from the crowd waiting to board the train. Toorop and Rebeka try to take her back despite her continued pleas not to. Seconds later, a bomb explodes in the crowd, sparing them because Aurora had bolted. Shaken, they board the train and Toorop demands an explanation for Aurora's apparent prescience. Rebeka shrugs it off as coincidence and explains that Aurora was probably just scared as it was her first time out of the convent. The train continues on to Vladivostok, passing a nuclear blast crater on the way. They arrive in a refugee camp in Vladivostok. Toorop contacts a Russian smuggler and old friend named Finn  in a nightclub and secures passage by submarine through the Bering Strait to Canada. An unknown group suddenly intercepts them and tries to offer Toorop a million dollars to relinquish Aurora to their custody. When this fails, they try to abduct her. After a fight the leader of the group tells Aurora that they knew her father. With this revelation, Aurora agrees to go with them, but Toorop stops her at the last second. In the morning, they go with the refugees across the frozen sea to board the submarine. However, to avoid satellite detection, the submarine can only surface for 2 minutes, leaving some refugees behind and even resorting to shooting them. Aurora, infuriated by the loss of life, starts to operate the 30-year-old submarine, without having ever learned about it. She states that she can 'feel them dying' and threatens the submarine crew with a gun but is eventually subdued by Toorop and the submarine continues to submerge. Rebeka and Toorop are both mystified by Aurora's outburst and her apparent knowledge of the submarine controls. Sister Rebeka explains to Toorop that Aurora could speak nineteen different languages by the age of two, and always seems to know things she has never learned. Three months before leaving with Toorop, she had begun acting in ways she never had before. Her change in behaviour began after a visit by a Noelite doctor who had administered a pill to Aurora. The doctor told her to go to New York City and arranged for Toorop to take them. Finn tells Toorop that he suspects Aurora was carrying a viral bomb, which he saw exploding in Uzbekistan 2 years prior. Toorop tells him that if she is carrying some kind of a virus, he will kill her instantly. She overhears this. On landing in Canada, they cross the border to the United States with snowbikes. Along the way they are spotted and attacked by two aerial drones patrolling the borderlines, wounding Toorop. Aurora again displays extraordinary medical knowledge as she pulls out a piece of metal from Toorop's wounds. Finn attempts to kill Toorop and Rebeka and take the passport and Aurora, but Toorop shoots him first. They cross the border safely and leave for New York by plane. In New York, in Toorop's old apartment, they learn from a news broadcast that the Noelite convent they were from had been hit by a missile the moment they crossed the Canadian border. This causes the group to realize that there is more going on than they know. The Noelites have become a major new salvationist religion, which vast numbers of people cling to as the world spirals out of control. However, in private meetings, it is seen that their High Priestess is really just after power, and tries to use various invented miracles to get more people to believe in the truth of her religion. Gorsky, working for the Noelites, had planted a tracking device in Toorop's passport, and then bombed the convent when he knew they were in the United States. The doctor who earlier saw Aurora in the convent then appears to examine her again. When he leaves, Aurora reveals to both Rebeka and Toorop that she is pregnant with twins, even though she is a virgin. Looking outside, Toorop sees Gorsky's men as well as the Noelite group, heavily armed and waiting for them. The High Priestess then calls Toorop and asks him to bring Aurora outside. As they were letting Aurora into the limousine, Rebeka warns Toorop with a glance. One of the guards had a gun pointed at them, ready to kill them once Aurora was handed over. Toorop changes his mind and starts a firefight with the two groups with the ultimate goal of getting the two women to safety. However, because of the tracking devices, Gorsky's men can lock onto Toorop with tracking rockets. Rebeka is shot and killed defending Aurora, who in turn shoots Toorop saying the words, "I need you to live." By dying, the rocket goes off target and explodes near Aurora instead. Aurora survives the rocket explosion apparently with seemingly supernatural powers, as the scene from the beginning is shown. Toorop's body is revived by Dr. Arthur Darquandier , using advanced medical techniques, but Toorop's right arm and left leg are replaced with cybernetics to undo the damage of being dead for over two hours. Darquandier explains that when Aurora was a fetus, he enhanced her by using a supercomputer to 'implant' intelligence into her brain. The Noelite group had him create Aurora to become pregnant at a certain time in order to use her as a vessel for twin babies with almost supernatural intelligence. The apparent "virgin birth" and the powers of her children were supposed to provide a manufactured "miracle" to boost membership of the Noelites. After she was born, the Noelites hired Gorsky to kill Darquandier, but Darquandier survived. He remained "dead" until he found his daughter in Russia with Toorop. Doctor Darquandier uses a machine to go through Toorop's memory to find what Aurora said to him before Toorop "died". In Toorop's memory, Aurora tells Toorop to "go home." Toorop, as well as several of Darquandier's men, leave the facility. En route to Darquandier's lab, the High Priestess calls Gorsky, at which point he is killed a missile sent by the High Priestess. Darquandier is later killed by the High Priestess, but Toorop has already escaped. Toorop goes to his old family house in the forest and finds Aurora, and as he takes her with him, they are found and chased by the Noelite henchmen, with the High Priestess personally shooting at them. He destroys the pursuers and he and Aurora escape. With Darquandier and High Priestess dead, Toorop stays with Aurora, rebuilding his old cottage. Six months later, Aurora gives birth to the children, but she says to Toorop that she was "designed to breed", not to live, indicating that she will die. Toorop stays with the children as their caretaker.
