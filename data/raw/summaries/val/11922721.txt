Sisters Lisa  and Jenny  arrive at the resort town of Snowfield, Colorado where Jenny is the town Doctor. They discover that the town is empty, but also find the bodies of their cleaning lady and a police officer. They join Sheriff Bryce Hammond  and his deputies Stu Wargle  and Steve Shanning  in investigating. Deputy Shanning, going to investigate screaming heard outside, then disappears in a flash of light, leaving behind his gun, hat and shoes. When they arrive at a nearby hotel, they are attacked by a creature who kills Deputy Wargle. Responding to a scrawled message in a hotel room, they contact Professor Flyte , who tells them the creature is an Ancient Enemy who periodically wipes out civilizations. An Army commando unit arrives with plans to destroy the enemy, and is systematically wiped out by it. Flyte discovers that the creature's body is physiologically almost identical to crude oil, and theorizes that bacteria bioengineered to break down oil spills should kill it. The Mobile Lab has such bacteria samples aboard, in case of terrorist attacks. Bryce is determined to kill the creature after it takes the form of a boy he accidentally killed during an FBI drug raid. Bryce sprays it with the bacteria, destroying the creature. Bryce reassures Lisa and Jenny that it is gone, but Flyte thinks it won, and announces he is going to tell the world what happened. Flyte releases a book titled "The Ancient Enemy", which is based on his experiences. Later, two bar patrons argue about the existence of alien life. Nearby, a sheriff's deputy starts to laugh. The deputy, formerly known as Stu Wargle turns around and asks them,"Do you want to see something?"{{cite web}}
