Michele, a shepherd of Orgosolo unfairly charged with rustling and murder, is forced to take to the hills. In his flight into the inaccessible areas of Barbagia, where there is neither water nor pastures, he loses every sheep in his flock. One night, desperate because he is full of debts, and with impending trials up ahead, he goes into the sheepfold of another shepherd and, at gunpoint, steals every sheep. Michele has become a bandit.
