The story follows a reporter named Richard Dees as he attempts to follow and catch up with a murderer who kills his victims in a vampiristic style, and who seemingly flies to each murder scene by plane, a black Skymaster. At one point, Dees finds dirt in the plane, heightening the suspense of this film. The plot culminates in Dees' confrontation with 'The Night Flier' and his own loss of sanity. Dees' nemesis is a young female reporter who joins the staff at the exploitative magazine "Inside View", where he ranks as senior reporter. She at first is dismissed by him as naive and at best a "Jimmy", as in "Jimmy Olsen", then is actively abused by him. She ultimately survives him and writes about Dees' death, prominently featured on the title page of the magazine "Inside View".
