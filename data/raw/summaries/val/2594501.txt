In a modern day prologue, a group of hikers caught in a storm seek shelter in a cave. They encounter an anthropologist  who interprets prehistoric carvings that introduce the story of a young caveman. Tumak  is chosen from his hunting party to kill a small Ceratopsian. He wrestles it to death. An elderly man in the party falls from a cliff and is left to die. The hunting party arrives at the Rock Tribe's cave with their prey. The beast is cooked on a fire and when it is done, the strongest feed first, next the women and children, then the few elderly pick the scraps. Tumak defends his portion from demands by Akhoba, the tribe's leader . The two fight and Akhoba knocks Tumak over a cliff as his mother watches. Tumak awakens to find a mastodon attacking him. He runs and climbs a tree. The mastodon rams the tree and knocks it into a river. Tumak floats miles downstream unconscious and is found by Loana  of the Shell Tribe. Her tribesmen respond to her shell horn call and take Tumak to their cave. The tribe gathers for a meal of boiled vegetables, which is shared orderly, with the children, women and elderly served first. Tumak awakes and Loana gives him food, which he guards as he eats, perplexing the tribe who share and do not fight over food. Tumak looks on, confused by the customs of the Shell Tribe. Meanwhile, Akhoba leads the Rock Tribe on a hunt in the hills but is injured trying to take down a muskox. As Akhoba lies helpless, a younger hunter asserts authority over the others and takes Akhoba's place as leader leaving Akhoba to die. Later, Akhoba, crippled, shows up at the cave but is treated with disdain. Tumak adjusts slowly to life with the Shell Tribe. He helps the children gather food by shaking fruit out of a tree and they teach him how to laugh. He tries to fish with Loana, but gets frustrated as land hunting is not like spear fishing. While he is fishing, an Allosaurus traps a child in a tree. Tumak uses a spear to kill the monster and save the child, but does not want to return the spear to its owner, believing he has won the right to claim it. Later that night Tumak steals the spear and a hammer from their maker, and attacks him when he tries to reclaim them. The tribal leader, Loana's father, banishes Tumak. As Tumak departs, Loana, who has fallen in love with him, follows him, much to his chagrin. Tumak pulls apples from a tree for himself ignoring Loana. Seeing that she has trouble reaching them herself, he relents and helps her. Along the way they spot a strange creature which chases them up a tree. Later, as Tumak and Loana reach Rock Tribe territory, they are trapped in a fissure during a fight between a dimetrodon and a lizard-like dinosaur. Loana escapes but is menaced by the leader who displaced Akhoba. She blows her shell horn leading Tumak to her rescue. He saves her by defeating the leader and becomes the new leader. Tumak has Loana handle the meals, which confuses the Rock Tribe, since she feeds the women and children first, then Akhoba whom she has sat on his former throne, and then the other elders. Lastly Tumak and the able-bodied men are fed. The next day Akhoba comes outside to see his tribe learning to gather fruits and vegetables, with Loana showing them which are good to eat and which are bad. Loana and Tumak sit and talk but Tumak is called away to help hunt a deer while Loana helps search for a missing child. A nearby volcano erupts, scattering the Rock Tribe and destroying their cave. A child's mother is engulfed by a lava flow; Loana saves the child but is cut off from the others by the lava flow. She and the child head to the Shell Tribe. Many animals fall into the crevasses opened up by the eruption. Tumak searches for Loana but finds only a scrap of her clothing near the lava flow and believes her dead. Later a Shell tribesman seeks out Tumak and tells him that Loana is alive but the Shell Tribe is trapped in their cave by a large monitor-like dinosaur. Tumak orders the Rock Tribe women and children to stay behind as he leads his men to attack and kill the animal. The Shell Tribe hold the beast off with torches. Tumak's direct attack is futile. Akhoba advises Tumak to distract the dinosaur while the rest of the men climb to higher ground. They start a rockslide that kills the beast. The formerly despised Akhoba becomes recognized for his experience and wisdom. The two tribes now unite. Tumak, Loana and the rescued child are framed in the dawn of a new day.
