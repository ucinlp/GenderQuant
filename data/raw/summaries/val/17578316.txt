The film opens with the murder of gangsters relaxing in a tanning salon. This shooting occurs between clans of the DiLauro camorra syndicate which rule Scampia-Secondigliano, and triggers the so-called "Faida di Scampia"  which is the backdrop of the entire movie. The Faida erupted between members of the DiLauro syndicate and the so-called "scissionisti"  who were led by Raffaele Amato who was a brother of two of the killed men in the opening scene. This fact is understood in the scene in which don Ciro tries to switch sides and join the "scissionisti" faction by talking to a camorra boss  and at a point says "we were all friends before..." and the boss replies "before! Before we were all friends...then BUM ! BUM ! BUM!...your friends started doing the sh*t...my parents were good people and that's how they took them out!". This plot backdrop is missed by most foreign spectators that aren't aware of the Faida di Scampia history and hardly understand any of the strict Neapolitan dialogues. The film intertwines five separate stories of people whose lives are touched by organized crime. Don Ciro Don Ciro  is a timid middleman who distributes money to the families of imprisoned clan members. After the feud develops within the clan, he is ambushed by two angry gangsters whilst making a delivery. Wanting to save his own skin, he later offers to defect to their side. They explain to him their families were murdered by the clan and want retribution, and that they have no need for a money-carrier. Instead, Ciro leads them to the location where he is given the money for distribution. The pair raid the place, killing everyone but Ciro, and take the money. Ciro quietly walks off to an uncertain future. Totò Totò  is a 13-year-old grocery delivery boy who observes some drug dealers ditch a bag of drugs and a gun when running from the police at Sette palazzi in Scampia. He returns the items to the gang, who take him in. His initiation in an underground cavern involves him being shot while wearing a bulletproof vest as a test of courage. As the feud develops, families in the neighborhood that are perceived to be disloyal receive a warning to move out or suffer violence; Totò's fellow gang members received similar threats. Later, while hanging out with his gang in the streets of Scampia, one of his gang is killed in a drive-by. The gang decides to stand their ground and exact violent retribution by selecting a woman, Maria , as their next victim, because her son has joined a clan of Scissionisti di Secondigliano. Totò, who has delivered groceries to Maria, is forced to lure her out of her apartment, where his comrades execute her. Roberto Roberto  is a graduate who works in waste management. His boss Franco  illegally dumps toxic waste such as chromium and asbestos at sites such as abandoned quarries. During an operation, a drum of toxic chemicals is accidentally spilled on a driver. Franco refuses to call an ambulance, and when the workers refuse to handle the waste, Franco instead hires children to drive the trucks. When he sees firsthand the harmful effects of illegal toxic waste dumping on people's health, Roberto can no longer contain his disgust and quits. Pasquale Pasquale  is an haute couture tailor who works for Iavarone , a garment factory owner with ties to the Camorra. Pasquale takes a night-job training Chinese garment workers. Because they are competing with Camorra-controlled firms, the Chinese drive him to and from work in the trunk of their car. His secret work is discovered nonetheless, and on a ride home two gunmen on a scooter open fire on the car. He survives but feels forced to abandon his career, taking a job as a truck driver. At a truck stop one night, he sees Scarlett Johansson on TV wearing one of his dresses. Marco and Sweet Pea Marco  and Ciro  are two cocky, out of control, teenage wannabe-gangsters who try to operate a small racket independent of the local clan. Full of youthful exuberance and impressed with mafia portrayals from Hollywood movies, they quote lines and spontaneously reenact scenes from Scarface in Walter Schiavone's villa while dropping references to Tony Montana, Miami, and Colombians. Their first score is sticking up African immigrants during a drug purchase at the famous Hotel Boomerang, Castel Volturno. The word of the incident gets to the local mob chieftain Giovanni , who summons them and warns them under threat of violence not to repeat such behavior in the future. Ignoring him completely, they spy Camorra gangsters hiding a stash of weapons. They steal the weapons and amuse themselves by firing off rounds by the banks of a Regi Lagni canal estuary in the marshland. One day, out of money, they use their guns to rob a video arcade. They spend their money at a strip club, where the angry gangsters find them and threaten to kill them if they don't return the weapons within a day. The pair prove stubborn, so Zio  Vittorio , one of the local gangsters tries a different tactic: he approaches them in a bar with an offer to come work for him. He offers them €10,000 if they return the weapons and conduct a murder of Peppe O'Cavallaro, in fact uncle Bernardino . They accept the offer, which turns out to be a trap, as they are ambushed and killed by Giovanni, Bernardino, Vittorio and others at the location of their supposed target, an abandoned beach resort next to Regi Lagni canal estuary, and the last scene shows their bodies being taken away by a bulldozer.
