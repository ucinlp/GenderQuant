David Lewis  is so affected by the death of his beautiful wife Gillian , who fell from the mast pole of their boat on a sailing trip, that he turns their summer cottage in Nantucket, Massachusetts into a permanent home and spends most of his time on the beach there, communicating with his dead wife's spirit and unwittingly neglecting his teenage daughter Rachel . On the second anniversary of Gillian's death, David invites Gillian's sister Esther Wheeler  and her husband Paul  to stay for the weekend. Esther insists on bringing a female friend named Kevin Dollof  whom she hopes David will become romantically interested in. David, however, ignores her in proceeding with a ritualistic celebration of Gillian's birthday. The events of the weekend cause the adults to re-examine their relationships; Esther and Paul have to deal with the problem posed to their marriage by Rachel's provocative young teenage friend, while, most importantly, David comes to realize that he can be a loving and attentive father to Rachel without betraying the memory of Gillian.
