{{plot}} Timothy "Tim" Conrad  is an ambitious financial executive who entices wealthy Swiss businessman Martin Mueller  to become a client of his firm. Impressed by Tim's creative marketing ingenuity, his boss Lance Fender  invites him to a "dinner for winners," to which Tim must bring a "talented" guest; the winner earns a trophy and the executive that brought him or her gets glory. Tim learns it is actually a "dinner for idiots" and the award is to the biggest "loser". Tim's girlfriend Julie  lands a curator deal for eccentric artist Kieran Vollard . Tim unsuccessfully proposes to her, as he has done several times before. After learning of the cruel nature of the dinner party, Julie becomes upset and asks him not to attend. He agrees. The next day, Tim accidentally hits IRS employee Barry Speck  with his Porsche as Barry attempts to retrieve a dead mouse in the road. While helping Barry pick up his belongings from the street, Tim learns of Barry's hobby of constructing mouse dioramas and realizes Barry is the perfect guest for the company dinner. Julie is upset that Tim intends to attend the dinner, so she walks out on Tim to be alone and accidentally leaves her cell phone behind. Barry shows up at Tim's apartment a day early. He gets on Tim's computer and foolishly gives Tim's home address to Darla , a woman Tim had a one-night stand with before he met Julie. Tim tells him that Darla has been stalking him ever since. Barry  decides to guard Tim's apartment, but mistakes Julie for Darla, sending her away and giving her the mistaken impression that Tim is cheating on her. Having messed up again, Barry decides to help by calling Vollard to locate Julie. Believing they hear Julie in the background, he and Tim sneak into Vollard's home. Kieran, dressed as an animal, is discovered with two women, dressed as birds, in an art "process." Returning to Tim's, Barry finds Darla waiting outside, wearing a suspicious overcoat. Underneath is a leather outfit made of tight pants and a corset. She attempts to seduce Tim, who tries to get her to leave. Tim gets a phone call from Julie, but can't answer because Darla snatches his phone and hides it in the front of her thong. Tim locks himself inside his room as he continues to try to get in contact with Julie. Frustrated by his rejection, Darla tries to seduce Barry in order to spite Tim but fails because Barry innocently fails to comprehend all of her sexual innuendos, which finally gets her to leave. Barry finds a message on Julie's cellphone from Vollard, revealing that Julie is leaving for Vollard's ranch. Barry, trying again to make amends, suggests that they go to his IRS office to find records containing Vollard's ranch address. They meet Barry's boss Therman Murch , who displays "mind control" power over Barry. He will help only if Barry will say "You can eat my pudding," which Barry refuses to do. So Therman looks up Tim's instead and informs him that he will be audited, and they leave without the address. Outside, the two see Therman kiss a woman Barry reveals is his ex-wife, saying, "I used to call her pudding." Tim lets Barry sleep at his place. He finds several pictures  depicting Barry's life, including him walking in on Therman and his wife in bed which is followed by mouse-Barry tearfully eating by himself, causing Tim to feel sorry for Barry. The next morning, Tim arrives at a brunch with Mueller, making an excuse for Julie's absence. Back at the apartment, Barry takes a call from Tim's assistant Susana , who emphasizes the importance of Julie's attendance. So, he crashes the business lunch, bringing Darla, who pretends to be Julie. Tim is goaded by Mueller into proposing to her, which he does just as Julie arrives unexpectedly. After Darla smashes Tim's Porsche, Barry tries again to make amends by giving in to Therman's humiliating demands so that he can get Vollard's address. At the ranch, Vollard is attempting to seduce Julie with his art "process." Tim explains recent events to her, but while confiding what a fool Barry is, Barry overhears. Julie tells Tim she is leaving for San Francisco with Vollard. Barry sadly confesses he never knew what his wife thought of him until she left him. Tim apologizes for what has happened, and Barry returns home to his mouse dioramas. After the loss of his "talented" guest, Tim arrives at the dinner party armed with excuses. To his surprise, he finds Barry has arrived on his own, and is already impressing Fender and Mueller. Barry's dioramas become a hit at the party, making him a shoo-in for the trophy, but unexpectedly, Therman arrives and embarrasses Barry with his mind control. Tim takes Barry aside, tells him everything and, after some encouragement, entices Barry to overcome Therman with "brain control". Upon Barry's reception of the trophy, Tim confronts Fender, saying he has been on the wrong side all along â€“ he stands with the group of "losers". As the real purpose of the dinner is revealed, the guests react unhappily and inadvertently cause chaos, resulting in a vulture carrying off Mueller's finger  and the house catching fire. Tim returns home and finds Julie's note that she has gone. Knowing he has lost all but done the right thing, Tim tells Barry how much he loves Julie and how badly he messed things up with her. Barry, seeing Julie has just shown up at the doorway, goads Tim into continuing to describe how he messed up. Barry explains to Vollard  that if he takes Julie it will break Tim's heart and people die of broken hearts; Vollard valiantly steps aside. An epilogue of Barry's dioramas tells how everyone fared in the end: Tim marries Julie and they honeymoon in Paris; Barry enters into a relationship with Darla, does some artwork with Vollard, and hosts a monthly "breakfast for champions" for all of the "losers"; Therman writes a book from a mental hospital; Tim and Julie collaborate on a new museum in Switzerland with Mueller. It is revealed that Fender's company has gone under and Forbes magazine has named him "Wall Street's Biggest Loser".
