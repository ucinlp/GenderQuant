Dissatisfied with a torn shirt button, an artist redraws a self portrait with the button in place. He then goes on and changes the portrait into a young man in an expensive suit against the backdrop of a new car and a country house. Wanting to show off the result, he shows the portrait to his girlfriend. The painted handsome man comes to life and begins to aggressively flirt the girl. The confused artist has great difficulty dealing with his opponent.
