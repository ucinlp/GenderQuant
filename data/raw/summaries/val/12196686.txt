{{plot}}  The movie opens with Reed Fish  being called to come into work by Maureen , the town's mayor. Reed arrives at his job and proceeds to do his daily radio segment, which ranges from reporting the news to helping the townspeople overcome the crisis of too-high hedges. Reed goes to a local store and meets Jill , his high-school crush. They exchange greetings and Reed invites her to be on his show, saying that people of Mud Meadows will want to hear all about her life since she went to college. She accompanies him to film a TV segment about the local "zorse" along with his friend and one-man-film crew, Frank . We then see Reed watching his TV segment in the presence of Kate , his fiancee, Irv , his soon-to-be-father-in-law, and Maureen. Kate asks him details about the wedding and Reed halfheartedly responds. The next day, Reed wakes up to Kate urging him to get to work and reminding him they have to go to the caterers. Reed goes into the radio station and proceeds to begin interviewing Jill. He mentions a rumor that she was going to law school, which she avoids talking about. A few people call in, some to wish Jill good luck and some to ask Reed to help them with their menial problems. As the show finishes, Kate arrives at the studio and reminds Reed of their appointment. Kate, Jill, Frank, and Reed agree to all hang out that night. As Kate and Reed arrive at the caterers, the sound inexplicably cuts off. The scene cuts to a view of people sitting in an audience, watching the movie and complaining. We see Reed hurriedly trying to fix it. We then see a girl  stand up and leave the room. Reed follows her, and apologizes for putting "their story" up on screen. He makes it clear that this girl is either the real Kate or the real Jill, but he doesn't say which she is. He then says that he knows he hurt her and he's sorry. The movie is fixed, and we return to Kate and Reed having a fight because Reed isn't excited about any of the wedding planning and says that he "doesn't care". The scene cuts to that night with the gang at a bowling alley. Reed and Jill go to get snacks and Rex , Jill's ex-boyfriend, shows up and apologizes to Jill for throwing a hamburger at her head when they broke up. Jill brushes the apology aside, saying it was a long time ago, and the five of them go to have a "dance-off" on a DDR type game. Kate and Frank go home, saying they have to be at work early the next morning. Reed and Jill plan to go to a bar, but instead sneak up on Reed's neighbor's roof for stargazing just as they did in high school. Jill confesses that she secretly dropped out of college two years ago to become a songwriter. The next day Reed visits a local bar and meets Andrew  and Teresa ([[A. J. Cook , another young couple engaged to be married soon. Jill appears at the bar and Reed then encourages her to participate in the talent segment and Jill sings an original song she wrote. The performance is met with thunderous applause and Andrew and Teresa beg Jill to sing at their wedding. Jill and Reed leave, and Reed begins kissing her. Jill responds, but they break apart when a truck drives by. Reed goes to Kate's house and tells her he loves her. He then begins crying, and when Kate asks why, he says it's because he loves her and he just made out with Jill. Kate becomes angry and Reed says that he might not be ready to get married. Kate agrees, which surprises Reed and prompts him to beg Kate to reconsider. Kate removes her ring and says that she won't marry someone who doesn't want to get married. At the radio show the next day, Reed is plagued with hate calls. He receives numerous letters on his windshield reading "cheater". Reed meets with Jill at a local diner and she apologizes, but Reed assures her it isn't her fault. Jill says that she just wants to be friends, as she currently has a boyfriend named Gabe. Jill decides to stay away from Reed to keep their lives from becoming complicated. After a few weeks, Jill and Reed reunite at Andrew and Teresa's wedding rehearsal. They go out to eat and end up back at Reed's place and Reed asks her why they can't be together. Jill mentions Gabe and then leaves. At Andrew and Teresa's wedding, Reed is an usher. He meets Gabe, Jill's boyfriend whom she brought with her. As Kate arrives, they awkwardly greet each other before she takes her seat. The wedding begins, with a song from Jill. After the newlyweds kiss, Reed goes down into the basement with a large bottle of wine. Kate joins him, and confesses that she was scared about their wedding. She begins crying, saying that she knew that once the wedding occurred, she would have to deal with the fact that her mom is truly dead. Reed consoles her and in the next scene they are seen heavily kissing and removing their clothing. The next morning, Jill arrives at Reed's house and begins to say something, but stops when she sees Kate emerge in one of Reed's sweatshirts. Jill then gets angry at Reed and says that she thought that he wanted to be with her. Kate accuses Jill of breaking them up and tells Reed to just tell Jill that he loves her . Jill accuses Reed of living his father's life and Kate again asks Reed just to tell Jill that he loves her, but Reed chases after Jill, confronting her. We see Kate being hit with the realization that Reed doesn't love her. Jill yells that Reed doesn't love either of them, and storms off. Kate follows, calling Reed an "asshole" and saying that she was crazy for ever believing they had a second chance. The next morning, Maureen calls out to Reed on the radio to arrive at work, but he remains in bed. Frank tries to take over and fails. They put on some music and Frank comes over to Reed's house and encourages him to come in. Reed refuses and Frank leaves. Reed hears a townswoman over the radio pleading for Reed to come in, saying she needs his help. After Reed finally arrives, the woman asks him to call the fire department about a peacock. Reed explodes and starts cussing at the woman and telling her to call the animal control center herself and Frank tries to stop Reed, resulting in the two having a fight. Frank storms out. Later, Reed goes to Frank's house and they make up. Reed quits the radio show and Frank takes over, and the "movie" ends with Reed asking who he is and answering "I'm Reed Fish". We see the audience again, clapping loudly. Reed shakes the hand of a man named John Penner, who is played by the real Reed Fish. Reed accepts congratulations from everyone, and it is revealed that girl who played Jill is actually Frank's girlfriend. The girl Reed is looking for, though, is gone. In the limo, Reed sticks his head out of the sunroof for some fresh air and the real Kate  joins him. He thanks her for their peaceful relationship now. As Reed is about to enter his house, he gazes at the place where Reed and Jill stargazed in the movie. The real Jill is there and they make up and kiss.
