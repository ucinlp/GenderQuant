A star quarterback, Nick Bonelli isn't told by his coach until after winning a game that his parents have been killed in a car crash on their way to the stadium. Angered by the coach's insensitivity, Nick quits the team and the school. He decides to study architecture at a Chicago university called Sheridan but refuses to play football. A professor warns him that things are different at this school and that Nick will need to conform, including getting a shorter haircut. He makes only one friend, Howard Carter, and is soon subjected to hazing and insults from other students, including a fraternity that rejects him. A seductive waitress, Susie Ward, causes a fight that leads to a rift between Nick and Howard, and the latter being placed on academic probation. The architecture professor's secretary, Sharon Wallace, takes an interest in Nick and his troubles at school. Susie, who is candid about wanting to marry a rich Sheridan man someday, persuades Nick to join the football team. "We Want Nick" chants from the spectators precede his finally getting into a game, which Nick promptly wins with a touchdown. With a new haircut and new popularity, he is invited to join the frat. A drunken Howard is tricked by Susie into proposing marriage. When she learns from Nick that Howard is trouble at the school, she angrily hits Nick with a bottle. He is arrested, disgraced and thrown off the team. Nick watches the next game from a bar. Susie has a guilty conscience, however, and explains what happened. Nick is reinstated and rushes to the stadium by halftime. His play wins the game, and Sharon realizes that she's in love with him.
