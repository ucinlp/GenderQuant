Shecky Moskowitz  is a struggling young comedian who lands a menial job on a cruise ship as the Miss Universe contest is being held onboard. The Big Man On Deck for this voyage is Dickie Diamond , the ship's comedian and all-around ladies' man. As an assorted array of thugs, Panamanian mercenaries and terrorists try to storm the ship, Shecky hopes for one big chance to prove himself and enter the exciting world of cruise ship comedy. Shecky gets his chance to be the ship's comedian when it is thought that Dickie had fallen overboard into the sea and died.  Shecky is nervous about performing, but King Neptune  convinces him to go for the opportunity by telling Shecky about the power of laughter. Shecky's first performance is very unsuccessful as he is booed off the stage. Shecky is especially heckled by the construction worker Dave . However, after a lecture by Milton Berle, Shecky succeeds in making the audience laugh. At this point, the terrorists come onboard and want to kill Miss Australia. Shecky, remembering the advice about the power of laughter, saves Miss Australia by promising to put the assassins in a movie.
