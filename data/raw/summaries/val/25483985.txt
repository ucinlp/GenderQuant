While practicing on an outdoor rink near her home, Katie is befriended by Otto Brewer, a former Olympic skating champion, who offers to teach her "proper skating", and under Otto's tutelage, Katie blossoms into a magnificent skater.

Using her empathic ability, Blizzard feels Katie's sadness and flies to Katie's home to investigate.
