A series of violent deaths and the disappearance of a young woman bring FBI Agents Hallaway  and Anderson  to a town in rural Nebraska. They meet the three survivors of a mysterious bloodbath; the young Stephanie , the coke-addicted Bobbi , and the foul-mouthed Police Officer Bennett . Hallaway watches the trio's respective interviews with Captain Billings  and Officers Wright  and Degrasso , where they tell the story of what brought them there: Officer Bennett and his partner Officer Conrad , hidden from view, fire the tires out from speeders along a road, convince the drivers their tires blew out as a result of their speeding, and threaten the drivers afterwards. Stephanie was traveling on vacation with her family, sees a car with blood on it and tells it to her oblivious mother . Bobbi was getting drugs with her boyfriend Johnny , and all learn that a pair of killers are responsible for the murders and disappearance. Stephanie's father Steven  speeds and their car's wheel is shot out by Officer Bennett. Bobbi and Johnny are about to offer help, but the Officers arrive and harass all of them, making Steven put Conrad's gun in his mouth and making Bobbi swear at Johnny. In the midst of this, Stephanie tells both men about the bloody car she saw earlier. Eventually the officers leave. Steven gets to work changing their tire, and Bobbi gets out to talk with Stephanie's family, who all feel violated by the officers. Simultaneously Bennett and Conrad see the car Stephanie described further down the road, and race back. A large white van speeds into the back of Jimmy's car, killing him and Steven. A dead man is at the wheel and a live person is sitting in the passenger seat of the van, who Bobbi tries to save. Bennett and Conrad arrive back at the scene. In the chaos Officer Conrad is killed and persons emerge from the van wearing rubber masks and kill the rest of Stephanie's family. Presently, Hallaway and Anderson are trying to figure things out when bodies are discovered in a motel nearby. Anderson takes Wright and Degrasso to the coroner's office, leaving Hallaway with Bobbi, Billings, Bennet, and Stephanie, who whispers something in his ear after Anderson leaves. Hallaway talks with the three others, while Degrasso stumbles upon nude pictures of Anderson and Hallaway. Leafing through them in Anderson's backseat, Degrasso is shocked to see the Agents with the body of a dead woman. Anderson stops the car and shoots both of them. Hallaway, meanwhile, reveals that he was at the bloodbath earlier, and reveals he and Anderson are in fact the killers. Hallaway shoots Billings, and when Anderson returns Bennett and Bobbi are also murdered. Driving away, it's revealed that the bodies of the missing woman and two others are found at the motel, the latter presumably being the two real FBI Agents. As Anderson and Hallaway leave they see Stephanie on the side of the road. Hallaway admits that the little girl had been up on them all along, but that he didn't want to kill her.
