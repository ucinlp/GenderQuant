Shin Jin-ah , onetime lead singer of popular girl group Purple, works as the DJ of the radio show "Wonderful Radio" on SBS station Power FM while also trying to restart her career as a solo singer-composer under her goofy manager Cha Dae-geun . However, the ratings have been dropping, so when the show's producer leaves to have a baby, station manager Im  assigns the ambitious Lee Jae-hyeok  to her job with a brief to bring in some fresh ideas. Jae-hyeok is appalled by Jin-ah's casual, diva-ish work attitude and the two don't hit it off. When he challenges her to come up with a new segment for the show, she finally gets an idea from her restaurateur mother  in which members of the public come into the studio and sing a song to their loved ones. She calls the segment "The Song I Sing to You". The initial broadcast, involving a serving soldier, goes disastrously, but subsequent attempts, involving a brattish schoolgirl  and a taxi driver , are a big success. Jin-ah and Jae-hyeok start to bond. However, In-seok , the manager of TV drama actress Yoon Mi-ra  and a major supplier of talent to the radio station, is plotting to bring Jin-ah down and replace her with Mi-ra, who still hates Jin-ah for leaving Purple at the height of its fame and causing the group's break-up.{{cite web}}{{cite news}}
