Judge Chandrasekharam  is very kind and helpful to the relatives of the culprits. His wife dies after giving birth to a baby boy. His son Raja was killed by two youth . The judge who now wears the pleader's shoes argues in the favour of the young culprits and shocks the whole audience on bringing out the real intentions of the murder. Chandrasekharam questions the parents of both the youngsters and finally concludes the responsibility of parents in bringing up the children is the key to the future generation. Also he brings out the cultural deviations our country faces in the coming future. The film gives this message as an argument and at the end Chandrasekharam dies in the court hall.
