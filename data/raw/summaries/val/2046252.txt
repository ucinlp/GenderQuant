The story follows a hitman, Jef Costello , who religiously adheres to a strict code of duty. He lives in a spartan apartment whose interior contains a neatly arranged line of mineral water bottles, cigarettes on a bookcase, as well as a little bird in a grey cage in the middle of the room. He is taciturn and goes about his tasks like clockwork. The film opens with a fairly long take of the protagonist lying awake on his bed, smoking, when the following text appears on-screen, attributed to an ancient samurai writing entitled Bushido  : :There is no greater solitude than that of the samurai unless it is that of the tiger in the jungle... Perhaps... Costello has no criminal record due to his methodical way of working, which includes constructing elaborate alibis with his girlfriend Jane . He is hired to kill Martey, a nightclub owner. Despite his meticulous attention to detail, Costello leaves the scene of the crime with several people seeing him, including the club's beautiful piano player Valérie . Although the police Superintendent  believes Costello is the killer, the evidence against him is insufficient. Costello soon finds himself in a difficult position, being pursued by both the police and his employers. After being released from the police line-up, Costello loses a police tail and gets to a meeting point on a subway overpass. He walks up to a man who is one of his employers. Instead of paying Costello, the man shoots him in the arm and runs away. Costello returns home to take care of his wound before falling asleep. When he wakes up the same evening, he returns to the nightclub, prompting the barkeeper  to confront him, saying, "If you were the man the police are looking for, one could say that the murderer always returns to the scene of the crime." Costello soon meets the piano player and they develop a slight relationship. In the meantime, men from the police department bug his room. During this scene a bird in a cage is agitated and flits about the cage due to the intrusion. Upon returning, Costello notices that the birdcage has loose feathers scattered around but the bird was serene with his presence. Suspecting that his room had been intruded, Costello searches his room for the bug, finds it, and turns it off. In the meantime, police ransack Jane's apartment, turning her dressers inside-out, hoping to break her will and force her to testify. The superintendent tries to make a deal with Jane. He tells her that if she admits to have collaborated in fabricating Jef's alibi, she would have no more trouble with the police. Jane responds, "So you mean to say that if I perjure myself I will not find trouble with you? If I insist on telling the truth, then I can expect trouble. Am I right?" and shows the police officers the door. Costello leaves his apartment to call Valérie from a phone booth, but she does not answer the phone. Back home Costello notices yet again that his bird behaves strangely. While trying to figure out what could be the problem he finds himself held at gunpoint by the man who shot him before. Only this time he gives him money and offers him a new job. Costello thinks it's a trap. He overpowers the man and ties him up, extracting information about the man's boss  in the process. The boss is a man by the name of Olivier Rey . Following a chase scene at the Métro, Costello soon realizes that he is in a position in which he cannot win. He visits Jane and tells her that he will take care of everything. After that he goes to Rey's home, which, as Costello finds out, is the same house in which the piano player lives. Costello shoots and kills Rey and goes to Martey's nightclub. Whereas previously Costello had tried to be discreet and unseen by the nightclubbers, this time he comes in full view. He checks his hat, but does not take the ticket the young woman gives him. He walks over to the bar, where he puts on his white gloves, again in full view of everyone at the night club, especially the barkeeper. Costello walks toward Valérie, pulls his gun out and points it at her. She warns him not to stay, and after seeing the weapon, she simply asks "Why, Jef?" To which he replies, "I was paid to." After a moment of staring, the audience hears gunshots, but not from Jef's gun. Costello falls to the ground and dies. A junior police officer tells Valérie she is lucky they  were there; otherwise, Costello would have killed her. The superintendent picks up Jef's gun and opens it for all  to see. There were no bullets in the gun.
