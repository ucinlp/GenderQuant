The Girl and Death is a love story of Nicolai and the courtesan Elise. A love that is obstructed by materialism, wealth and the threat of death. The film, based on an original script by Jos Stelling and Bert Rijkelijkhuizen, tells the story of the Russian physician Nicolai, who returns to an old hotel, the place where he first met his great love half a century ago and relives his romantic tragedy. A large part of the film is set in the late nineteenth century, and the action takes place in an abandoned hotel/sanatorium in Tannenfeld, Thuringia where most of the film was also shot. The hotel still bears the traces of an impressive past. Eventually, it becomes clear why Nicolai has really returned.
