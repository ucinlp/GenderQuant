 The opening shot of the movie shows Kunti praying for Lord Krishna's protection for the Pandavas. Lord Krishna consoles Kunti and promises to ever protect the Pandavas and guide them through troubles and problems that may occur in life.  The sons of Pandu and Dhritarashtra progeny break into an argument. When Duryodhana insults the Pandavas as "dependents", Bheema counters by saying that, the Kauravas are the progeny of a widow. Duryodhana asks Veda Vyasa for an explanation. He is then told that, since his mother, Gandhari had an astrological defect, she is first married of to a goat and then married to his father. Duryodhana gains animosity towards the kingdom of Gandhara where the king, the father of his mother Gandhari, rules. He attacks Gandhara and lays waste of the whole kingdom. He them imprisons the royal family in his prison. He gives them only one rice grain per prisoner. The king of Gandhara then stops everyone from grabbing the little food that is provided. He says that instead of everyone dying, they could keep at least one of their princes alive. He chooses Sakuni to be alive. Sakuni takes an oath that he will do everything he can to destroy the entire Kaurava clan. He makes magic dice from his father's spinal cord. The magic dice show exactly the number that he would want. Duryodhana takes pity on the lone prisoner, Sakuni after the rest of the Gandhara royal family dies in prison out of starvation. Sakuni joins the evil of coterie of Duryodhana, Karna and Dushyasana.  Sakuni schemes an evil plan to kill the Pandavas through trickery. He constructs a house made of wax in Varanasi. Pandavas are ordered to go on pilgrimage to Varanasi until the troubled affairs of the state are resolved. Krishna sees through the plan of the evil Sakuni. He warns Bheema to keep an eye on miscreants trying to burn the house. He later orders Bheema to dig an underground tunnel from the wax house into a forest nearby, which Bheema does. On a midnight, as Krishna predicted, the house is burned by fire on the orders of Duryodhana.  Bheema however carries his four brothers and mother on his back and races through the tunnel and takes them to the hiding spot. There a certain cannibal rakshasa named Hidimbasura lives with his sister Hidimbi. He smells the scent of human beings and orders his sister to bring them. Hidimbi however fall in love at first sight with Bheema. Unable to wait any longer, Hidimbasura comes to kill the humans himself. Bheema however kills him very easily. Hidimbi is married to Bheema. She would later give birth to Ghatotkacha from this union.  Here the movie, takes focus of Pandavas and instead focusses on Lord Krishna as the primary character for some duration.  Sisupala, the king of Chedi and Rukmi are the kings under emperor Jarasandha. All three have deep hatred towards Krishna. Jarasandha proposes that Rukmi should marry his sister, Rukmini, to Sisupala. Little do they know that she is in love with Krishna himself. Narada acts as the mediator between the love couple. After a brief courtship, Rukmini elopes with Krishna. Rukmi tries to stop Krishna and challenges him to a fight. Krishna easily defeats him, and grants his wife - Rukmini's wish by keeping him alive. He however shaves half of his hair to add insult to the injury.  The movie returns to its primary focus on the Pandavas with Duryodhana taking a major share of the screen space towards the end.  Bakasura, Bheema, Keechaka, Jarasandha and Duryodhana are all born with their fate mingled with each other. As a result of that, the first amongst the five to kill the another... will eventually kill the other three. This secret is known to Krishna alone. The Pandavas live under the guise of sadhus in a remote town. Bakasura is a very powerful monster who plagues the town. He blackmails them to send two oxen, a cartload of food and a human being everyday to quench his hunger. It so happens that, the house owners of the Pandavas get their turn to send the human being on that day. However, Kunti says that she would rather sacrifice her own son instead of their only one, since she has five children. Bheema sets of to the monster's place, but on the way he eats all the food. After a very ferocious fight with the monster, he does kill it in the end. Bheema emerges as the victor.  The king of Panchala, Drupada announces an archery contest to win the hand of his daughter in marriage. Krishna tricks Karna into losing the contest. Arjuna however shows up as a Brahmin youth and wins the contest. Thus he wins Draupadi as a price. He goes home and tells his mother that he has won a price. Unknowingly, his mother asks him to share his price amongst all the five brothers. Thus all five brother, marry Draupadi.  As the Pandavas have emerged out of their disguise, they get a share of the Kaurava kingdom and develop the city of Indraprastha.  Jarasandha is the arch-nemesis of Krishna. No one other than Bheema or the other three mentioned earlier, can defeat him and he chases Krishna until Dwaraka. Bheema and Krishna go as Brahmins into the fortress of Jarasandha. There they ask for a fight. Jarasandha chooses Bheema as his sparring partner. During the fight, Krishna signals Bheema to tear him apart and as a result, he will be killed. However the body parts of Jarasandha rejoin as a part of a boon and he lives yet again. After some time, Krishna signals Bheema to throw Jarasandha's body parts in opposite directions. This time however Jarasandha dies.  Yudhisthira performs the Rajasuya yaga, to be crowned as the emperor. The Kauravas, arrive at Indraprastha as guests. Duryodhana visits the mayasabha, where he is overawed with the beauty of sculpture and architecture. However, when he is returning, he trips and falls into a pool. He hears some people laughing and sees Draupadi is among the crowd. He then concludes that she is behind all this and vows to avenge the insult in the presence of his brothers, Karna and Sakuni.  Sisupala is a relative of Sri Krishna and he is born with a lot of abnormal features. When Krishna touches him during his childhood, the child becomes normal. However a result of the broken curse, Krishna is destined to kill Sisupala. Krishna however promises Sisupala's mother that he would give his son a hundred chances before killing him. When Yudhistra elects Krishna as the chief guest at the Rajasuya yaga, Sisupala becomes enraged and foulmouths Krishna. Krishna counts hundred absurdities hurled at him by Sisupala. Then after his hundredth mistake Krishna hurls his discus Sudharshana chakra towards him. Sisupala's head is severed. When Duryodhana calls for Krishna to be arrested, Krishna unveils his Vishwa-avatar
