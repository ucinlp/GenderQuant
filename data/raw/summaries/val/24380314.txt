{{Expand section}} Niccolo  Vitelli is the oldest of three brothers and becomes the de facto head of their family after their father dies. Their father was in construction and the brothers follow in his steps. At first, they work for Polowski, who cuts corners and does not do an adequate job, as well as being verbally abusive to his employees. This causes them to start their own company - Vitelli Brothers Construction, which will be the opposite of Polowski. Mac starts becoming a tyrannical workaholic and eventually pushes his brothers away.
