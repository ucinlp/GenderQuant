In 2001 in Iraq, two American Navy pilots - Butch Masters and Tom Craig - are ordered to bomb an abandoned plant. The order appears to be false. American experts get killed in the plant. A secret chemical device, called "Rainmaker", designed for oil fields destruction, gets stolen. Military court cannot prove the pilots intentions, and gives them a dishonorable discharge. After 7 years Craig is rich and famous. He manages a private pilot team, working for Top Gun and for movies. Masters is a grease monkey in a small airport. He still tries to investigate his old case, and dreams of his own pilot's team. In order to get a license to fly Russian jets, Masters goes to St. Petersburg, where he meets old friends and new problems. At the same time, a Kurdish terrorist group plans to capture a part of Northern Iraq and found a new Kurdish state there. They plan to use Rainmaker to destroy oil fields there and make the territory uninteresting for Americans. The terrorists base is located in Northern Iran, and cannot be reached by US military. Navy intelligence offers Masters to clear his name by performing a secret off-records mission to Iran with a team of retired pilots. Using unmarked planes, they have to bomb the base and destroy "Rainmaker". Doomed to death, betrayed by friends, left in the Syrian desert, Masters and his team finds unexpected support from a Russian Knights jet fighter aerobatic group. Russians and Americans go to the final battle side by side.
