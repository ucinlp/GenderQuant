Charles and Millie Vickery operate a small pub in Sydney, with Millie's younger sister Alice helping out as a barmaid. Against Millie's strenuous advice, Alice starts seeing Nick Homer, a married American officer who is temporarily stationed in the neighbourhood. As Charles, her husband, is called up for Australian army service, Millie succeeds in ending Alice's affair but falls in love with Nick herself, conducts a torrid affair with him in secret, and becomes pregnant. When her husband unexpectedly returns, having been injured during training, Millie contrives to attribute her pregnancy to him, relying on his desire for a child whom they had previously failed to conceive over 8Â½ years of marriage.
