Flamboyant window dresser Hollywood Montrose  has now been promoted to the head of Prince & Company's visual display department. He takes on a new assistant, Jason Williamson , who in times past was Prince William, the Prince of the kingdom of Hauptmann-Koenig. One thousand years ago, he lost his beloved Jessie  when an evil sorcerer  turned her into a wooden icon, now known as the Enchanted Peasant Girl. As a tribute to Hauptmann-Koenig, the Enchanted Peasant Girl is being sent to Prince & Company for a window display. Jason awakens Jessie and the two get reacquainted, having a millennium of things to catch up on. But the evil sorcerer, now reincarnated as Count Gunther Spretzle, arrives on the scene to take Jessie  and hop a flight for Bermuda, with Jason as the only one who can stop him.
