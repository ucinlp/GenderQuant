J.C. Wiatt  is a driven Manhattan career woman  whose fast-paced lifestyle leaves her with no time for romance or relaxation, though she derives pleasure from her frantic schedule and demanding job. She works as a management consultant and lives with an investment banker  whose job and lifestyle are likewise hectic. Her life is thrown into turmoil when she inherits a toddler, Elizabeth , from a deceased cousin whom she hadn't seen since 1954. Soon, caring for the child occupies much of her time, and her business career begins to suffer, culminating in the loss of her boyfriend and job. Wiatt tries to give Elizabeth up for adoption, but finds that she has grown too attached to the child, forcing a reevaluation of her priorities. She moves into a house in the country in Vermont. Purchasing the home without first having seen it in person or having it inspected, she finds it is riddled with problems . Suffering a nervous breakdown and on the brink of financial collapse, she sees an opportunity to sell baby food applesauce she had concocted for Elizabeth made from fresh ingredients. Amid the clamor for her new products, she develops a relationship with local veterinarian Jeff Cooper . At first annoyed by him, she is opposed to Jeff's overtures and is focused now on as fast as possible to return to New York. Finding a buyer for the house proves almost impossible. After a rough start, she succeeds in selling her "Gourmet Baby Food", and soon business is booming. Finally, her old boss  and his client  take notice. They offer to buy her company for millions, take her product nationwide, and give her back her career and high-prestige lifestyle. On the brink of accepting, she decides that she can grow her enterprise on her own without having to sacrifice her personal life. She returns to Vermont to the arms of her new lover and adopted daughter.
