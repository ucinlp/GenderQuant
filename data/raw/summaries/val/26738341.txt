An unnamed man is sitting in a psychiatrists office, being released from an insane asylum. 3 years ago, he and three friends were mountain climbing, when an accident left them all suspended on one rope that was fraying. Being the closest to the top, he chose to cut the rope to save himself and dropped the other three to their death. He says that he knows his actions were wrong, but the doctor reminds him that when he was first admitted he said anyone would have made the same decision. Angrily he repeats that his actions were wrong, and the doctor says that means they've made progress, but they're working for closure. Seven friends are driving to their friend Brent's house to celebrate their upcoming college graduation. Alex, Brent's new stepsister, unexpectedly shows up to stay, something Brent isn't happy about, but they let her stay, trying to match her up with Freddy. They all party and later that night when everyone else is asleep, Nicole is grabbed by a strange man as she goes for a beer. Her body is then thrown through the window onto a sleeping Freddy, whose screams get the rest of the house down. The letters 'TV' carved into her stomach gets them to watch a video taken earlier, where Nicole is given a gun and told to shoot the sleeping Carlos to save her own life, but she refuses and is killed. The unnamed man from earlier tells the seven on the video that they will have to kill each other until only one person remains. If more than one person is still alive at 6 am, he will kill everyone. The group panics and Brent and Carlos go to try and find a way to escape. The boat Brent showed Carlos earlier is now sunk, but the gun on board is in the keybox, so Brent takes it. Carlos seeks an axe and goes to get it, but is caught in a giant bear trap. Brent tries to help, but then leaves him, saying to the others that he died. But the killer bandages Carlos and leaves him at the house. When he tells Jennifer that Brent left him, she loses all trust in Brent. Now that everyone's back, Michael leads them to the van to try and escape, but the van is caught by something and can't move. Over the radio, the unnamed man says that they must now throw one person out to die or they will all die. Brent decides to throw the mortally injured Carlos out and he is shot through the head with the rifle stolen from the basement. They all split up and run back to the house. Brent and Amber separate and he is caught by the killer, but is let go when he promises to kill someone. Alex had run off on her own to get her motorcycle, but the killer fires at her and shes forced to hide behind it until Brent slugs her and drowns her in the lake. He sneaks back to the house to talk to Freddy alone, saying that the boat is OK and if he can just get the gun from Michael they can escape. Freddy fakes a panic attack to get the gun and Brent comes in, but Amber tells what Brent had told her, that the boat was inoperable. Freddy realizes hes been tricked and shoots Brent, and tries to force everyone else out of the house. Michael convinces Freddy to drop the gun, just as Brent skewers him through the head with a poker, killing him. He grabs the gun and chases Michael and Jennifer down to the basement, but as they're cornered, Amber attacks Brent with a shovel and beats him to death. Jennifer grabs the gun and takes Michael upstairs. Amber finds a gun in her pill bag and draws on Jennifer, arguing with her over Michael, saying she loves him. Jennifer shoots Amber in the stomach, but Michael takes her and Jennifer down in the basement as the unnamed man approaches. They hide under the staircase and shoot at the unnamed man but it turns out to be Alex who survived Brent's attack. Jennifer then turns traitor and stabs Michael in the stomach. She tries to kill him, but Amber attacks her and strangles her to death. She crawls next to Michael, but as the clock chimes six and the man approaches, Michael kills himself to save Amber. As the man passes, Amber says she'll never be like him, and as he leaves he says we'll see. He leaves a phone message in the psychiatrist's office, saying that he's proved his theory and as he and a picture reveals, Brent was the doctors son. He laughs and says hes now found closure.
