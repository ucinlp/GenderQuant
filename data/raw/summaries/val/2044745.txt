During the Second World War a group of seemingly normal British soldiers arrive in the small, fictitious English village of Bramley End At first they are welcomed by the villagers, until doubts begin to grow about their true purpose and identity. After they are revealed to be German soldiers intended to form the vanguard of an invasion of Britain, they round up the residents and hold them captive in the local church. The civilians attempt to escape to warn the local Home Guard, but are betrayed by the village squire, who is revealed to be collaborating with the Germans, who ambush and kill the Home Guards. Eventually a young boy does succeed in escaping and, despite being badly wounded, alerts the army. British soldiers arrive, and aided by some of the villagers who have managed to escape and arm themselves, including a group of Land Army girls, defeat the Germans after a short battle. The squire is shot dead by the daughter of the vicar, who was murdered by the commander of the German soldiers. The film is set post-war and told in flashback by a villager  sitting in the churchyard where the German soldiers are buried. He speaks directly to the camera, which, during the opening credits, moves towards the village along a road, eventually arriving at the churchyard and being ushered toward a grave monument. The villager explains, "This is the only bit of England they got" .
