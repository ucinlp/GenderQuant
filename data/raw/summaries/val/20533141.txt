Woody is a street sweeper and gets into trouble with Officer Wally Walrus. He tries to get even for Wally throwing a banana peel on the sidewalk. He steals the cop's uniform and gets into the Jingling Bros. Circus because he is wearing it. Wally tries to get in, but he gets thrown out. He sneaks in under a tent, and Woody gives him a merry chase. Wally disguises himself as an elephant to catch the bird.
