Dan Cutler, the head of an advertising agency, invites his colleagues to a whitewater rafting trip. The invitation feels more like an order to some, Cutler considering the outing a test of his employees' confidence, courage and skills. Tragedy occurs along Canada's "white mile," when a canoe capsizes and several of Cutler's companions are swept away by the raging current. Some die, and Cutler becomes at odds with one of his top executives over how the aftermath should be portrayed to authorities and to relatives who are suing the company.
