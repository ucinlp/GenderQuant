Based on the 1943 classic book of the same name by Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry, the fable tells the story of an aviator  forced to make an emergency landing in the Sahara Desert. There he is befriended by a young boy, the Little Prince from Asteroid B-612. In the days that follow, The Pilot hears about his past and various journeys throughout the solar system. As he travels through space, the Little Prince encounters several strange grown-ups on different planetoids, all with a skewed way of looking at life. But it is not until he finally reaches Earth, that the Little Prince learns his most important life lessons of all, mainly from The Fox , and The Snake . These lessons the Little Prince shares with The Pilot, before the Little Prince dies.
