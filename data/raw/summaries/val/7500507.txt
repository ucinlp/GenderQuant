Terri Venessi , a local deli girl, always seems to be at odds with the cheerleading captain, Karen Ridgeway . One day their pranks on each other go too far and the school has to close as a result. The girls have to perform community service. A juvenile counselor tells them that the girls should switch lives for a while to experience the other girl's life. The counselor also notices that both mothers act the same way toward each other. Reluctantly, the girls and their families agree. Karen's family is quite affluent, but both parents work and are gone quite a bit. As a result, Karen, when she was home had to take care of Karen's little sister, Tiffany , and now Terri must. During the switch, Terri learns that Karen never stands up for herself to her mom  who grew up in the neighborhood with Terri's mom, and is now a social climber. While at Karen's, Terri and Karen's brother David  discover they like each other, especially after Karen gives Terri a "makeover." At Terri's, Karen is living with her mother , a widow, and grandfather Papa Tognetti . Terri's is a blue-collar family that runs an Italian deli. Karen's friends make fun of Terri and now are making fun of Karen, who discovers that her "friends" are very superficial. Her "best friend" Nicole Henderson  starts snubbing her and even tries to steal her boyfriend Chad Elkins , which causes problems for the couple. She also discovers that Terri's mom is much more "hands on" than her own mother and doesn't like things to change. She also can be a bit controlling. As a result of the switch, Millie  and Grace  gain perspective and restore their friendship. They apparently had a falling out when they were teens. Grandpa moves to a retirement village. Terri and Karen discover they like themselves and each other. Millie decides her family is more important than her clubs and Grace quits trying to hide in the past and embrace life again. Everyone benefits from the Mom Swap, especially Terri and David, who go to Prom together, and Karen and Chad, Prom Queen and King. Karen and Terri end up as best friends.
