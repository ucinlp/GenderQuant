In the heart of the Canadian wilderness, sultry and sexually assertive Vixen becomes quickly bored when her husband Tom, wilderness guide/pilot  leaves for the mountains. The hypersexual Vixen vents her frustration by attempting to seduce anyone within reach including a couple her husband bring home as clients , a Mountie, and eventually her own brother . After witnessing Vixen's exploits throughout the film, it ends by veering into political satire as Vixen's racism and the creeping threat of communism are discussed at length among the characters as the film draws to its end. At the end of the film her husband brings another couple home and Vixen smiles, apparently planning to seduce them.
