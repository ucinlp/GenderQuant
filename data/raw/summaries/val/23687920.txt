Vincent and Gennaro live by their wits and petty theft in the city of Naples. On Christmas Eve, Gennaro steals a service of glasses and gives it to his girlfriend Nannarella, a poor and honest seamstress . Unfortunately, it was discovered, and Gennaro and Vincenzo are arrested. While it is recommended to St. Joseph, it seems that they shower them with a gesture of their goodwill. Released from jail after three months full of good intentions, they are forgiven and Nannarella resumes contact with Gennaro. Since Vincent and Gennaro cannot find honest work, the two are forced to steal more.
