CLUBSCENE is a fast paced coming of age dramedy chronicling the self abusing lifestyle of a young clubber as he comes to the realization that there must be something more to his shallow, materialistic, vulgar, yet often hilarious, life. Bartender Gabe Garibaldi, played by Carmine DiBenedetto, is the King of the Clubscene in Montreal – the nightlife capital of North America. His uncle’s popular club – Club Touch – is the hottest spot in the city. Every night, Gabe and his buddies - club promoter Paul DelDuca  and celebrity DJ Vinni V – create the wild unforgettable atmosphere for the Montreal locale and tourists from all over the world. Gabe lives a high profile lifestyle. The girls love him. The guys want to be him. He gets what he wants when he wants it. And he loves it. Until he meets a girl who calls him out on his shallow lifestyle. She doesn’t fall head over heals for him. She doesn’t care that he’s best friends with DJ Vinni V. She’s unlike any girl he’s ever met. He realizes his life of perpetual hedonism is leaving him unfulfilled and disconnected. But he’s unsure how to get out, how to change. He begins to reevaluate his lifestyle and question who his friends really are.
