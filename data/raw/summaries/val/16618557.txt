At their wedding, the couple is approached by Julius , a lonely, elderly man who requests permission to kiss the bride. When he does, their spirits switch places, leaving Peter with an aged man's soul inside his newly wed bride. Whether or not he can see beyond the physical and embrace the beautiful soul he loves, Julius will agree to return to his cancer-riddled flesh by kissing Rita again.
