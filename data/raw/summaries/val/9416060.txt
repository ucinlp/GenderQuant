Jerry lives in the wall between two apartments, one where Tom lives and the other where Dupli-cat lives. Both cats show they are out to get him. Jerry screws up his courage and steals two of Tom's whiskers. He is attacked but tricks Tom into smacking Dupli-cat. He punches back and both cats assume Jerry is a "super-mouse". Jerry trips an arrow aimed at a cheese wheel, it strips the other cat of its fur. Tom ends up furless as well. An armed conflict escalates when Jerry directs the cat's fire at each other. Tom rolls a lighted firework into Jerry's hole, and Jerry rolls it back out under Tom. Tom hears it hissing under him and raises himself such that he is dazed, but not hurt, by the explosion. Both cats then arm a hand grenade and throw it into the mouse's hole, but they hit each other and return to their owners. The two grenades go back and forth until they both explode in their owners' hands, destroying almost the entire wall. The two cats give up and move out then go to Paris; Jerry whistles and follows.
