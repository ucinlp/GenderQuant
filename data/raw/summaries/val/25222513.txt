The movie is about Gattu  who is living the life his father chose for him. When Gattu was young, on one of his birthdays, skinheads broke his home window and yelled "We don't want you in our country." His father, Gurtej Singh Kahlon  grabbed a pot and beat one of the skinheads. He was arrested soon after but then released. A few weeks later, Gattu's uncle was killed in a racial attack. This changed Gattu's father and made him a kind of leader in the predominately Indian area of Southall in West London. He made a lot of changes that stopped racism where he lived. But his children were not allowed to do what they wanted and had to be very traditional Sikhs. Gattu had been good at cricket and wanted to play for England, though his dad would never let him become a member of the England team. In the present day, Gattu's girlfriend Simran  and siblings convince him to give it a shot. If he gets on the team, their father might be able to realize that the world isn't as racist as it used to be. They are able to hide the fact that Gattu is on the team, but their father eventually finds out. Seeing his son on a team he despises gives him a heart attack and he ends up in the E.R. Gattu plays cricket anyway. He is deeply hurt to be disgraced by his father, but he also loves cricket, and hopes to change his father. The people of Southall all come together, and try to convince Gurtej that it is okay to be a cricket player for England. He locks himself inside the house, where his wife tells him that she has never acted as a mother, only a wife, and often forgot she was both. She turns on the T.V., wanting to see her son fulfill his dream. Gurtej watches with her, and realizes how badly he had treated his son. The family comes back in the house, and Gurtej requests for one of them to drive him to the stadium. Gattu is playing poorly, because he is so upset that his father disgraced him. Only at the last ball of the game, does Gattu manage to win the championship for England. His father compares his bowling to Late Lala Amarnath. His father apologizes to him, and Gattu's siblings are now able to pursue their dreams.
