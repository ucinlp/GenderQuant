Sam Baily gets laid off from his job as a museum security guard. In desperation for not being able to provide for his wife and kids, he comes armed with weapons and explosives and takes his boss Mrs. Banks and a number of children  as hostages. Television journalist Max Brackett is in the museum using the restroom after an interview with the curator about financial difficulties. He becomes directly involved in the hostage situation, acting as Baily's intermediary to the outside world and the police. Baily accidentally shoots a friend still working there as a security guard, sending him to the hospital, and later fires a gun again, frightening the children and becoming more and more unstable as he takes caffeine pills to stay awake. Along with a young intern, Laurie, Brackett reports the story exclusively on television, reviving his career. By being free to come and go, he negotiates with a national network and its star news anchorman, Kevin Hollander, with whom Brackett has an unhappy history. Baily wants the police to let him return home to his wife and kids, and won't accept that he's going to jail. Brackett on the other hand makes a deal rather than let Hollander have the story, prompting Hollander to publicly accuse Brackett of prolonging the crisis and endangering the children. When Baily's ex-colleague dies from his injuries, Baily starts to realize he's lost everything. Baily and Brackett allow the situation to worsen until the police finally have had enough, issuing a five minute ultimatum to Baily for release of the hostages. Baily lets the children as well as Brackett go, but rather than face prison -- and his wife -- he ultimately sets off his explosives, committing suicide. As reporters swamp Brackett and ask about Baily, all he can say is, "We killed him," referring to how the media handled the situation.
