Singham opens with an honest police officer in Goa, Rakesh Kadam , committing suicide because of false accusations of corruption by Jaikant Shikre , a don and politician in Goa running a kidnapping racket. Kadam's wife Megha Kadam  vows revenge. The story moves to Shivgarh, a small village near the Goa-Maharashtra border where majority of the population are of Marathi origin. Bajirao Singham , an honest Maratha police inspector like Kadam, is in charge. He resolves most of the problems in his town with non-violence and mutual counselling. He uses force only when the situation demands it, thereby gaining much reputation and love from the villagers. Gautam Bhosle  is an industrialist and a friend of Singham’s father Manikrao Singham . He comes to town with his beautiful daughter Kavya . Eventually Singham and Kavya fall in love with each other. Everything seems to run smoothly until Jaikant, who is given a conditional bail for a murder he committed, is required to travel to Shivgarh to sign the bail every fortnight. He, instead, sends one of his allies to do the formalities, much to the anger and rage of Singham who demands Jaikant sign the bail in person. Humiliated, Jaikant reaches Shivgarh but is unable to take any revenge on Singham fearing the immense love and devotion of the entire village towards Singham. Using his political contacts, he gets Singham transferred to Goa to teach him a lesson. Singham, unaware of Jaikant’s hand behind his transfer, joins Colva police station. His co-workers, Sub-Inspector Phadnis , Sub-Inspector Abbas , Head Constable Savalkar  hate Jaikant for his crimes but are unable to take any action because of Jaikant’s political powers. DSP Patkar , Singham's senior, is on Jaikant's payroll and takes care in concealing and eliminating the evidence of Jaikant’s crime from the eyes of the law. Singham tries to take this to the notice of DGP Vikram Pawar  but it turns out to be of no use as there is no evidences against Jaikant and Patkar. The local minister Anant Narvekar  does not help Singham and, in turn, he warns him to stay away from Jaikant's case. Defeated Singham wants to return to his hometown but is stopped by Kavya and Insp.Kadam's son Nitin  who encourage him to fight against the evil and not run like a coward. Being mentally tortured by Jaikant, Singham arrests Jaikant’s henchman Shiva  in a fake case of illegally smuggling alcohol. He thwarts off DSP Patkar in full view of the public when Patkar, bounded by his duties to Jaikant, tries to protect Shiva. Meanwhile, Megha Kadam, after being ridiculed by DGP Pawar and minister Narvekar for her corrupt husband’s death, seeks help from Singham to abolish the corruption charges against her husband; he obliges. Jaikant kidnaps Kavya’s younger sister for ransom. Rescuing her, Singham successfully traces the origins of the kidnapping racket to Jaikant but is unable to arrest him as he finally wins a political election to become a minister. Jaikant, on becoming a minister, manages to send transfer orders to Singham to go back to Shivgarh. That night at a police function organised for the officers with their family, Singham confronts the officers for not abiding to their duties and being dishonest and unfaithful to their profession by protecting Jaikant. Filled with guilt, the officers decide to help Singham fight Jaikant. They reach his home to kill him, with DGP Pawar and Patkar, now in support with Singham. Jaikant eventually escapes but, after running through the city, he is arrested by the police the next morning. They bring him to the police station and shoot him dead on the same chair where Inspector Rakesh Kadam shot himself. Then they threaten Shiva to change his statement. Jaikant and Minister Narvekar are proved guilty. At a media conference, DGP Pawar and Singham clear Kadam of all corruption charges. The film ends with Singham and other police officers saluting Mrs. Kadam.
