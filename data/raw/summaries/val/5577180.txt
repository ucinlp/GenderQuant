Tony Manetta is a single father, a widower, raising 11-year-old son Ally while owning and operating a small Miami Beach hotel called the Garden of Eden. In debt, given 48 hours by his bank to raise a little more than $5,000 or else lose his hotel, Tony in desperation tells older brother Mario that he needs a loan for Ally's sake, lying that the boy is ill. Mario and wife Sophie promptly fly from New York to Florida and find out the truth. Tony is "a bum" in Mario's eyes who puts his time and money into fanciful schemes rather than honest work. He is willing to stake Tony with funds, but only to begin a sensible small business such as a five-and-ten store. Tony also is set up with Eloise Rogers, a widow and acquaintance of Sophie's, who is seen to be a more appropriate companion for Tony than his current girlfriend, Shirl. To his surprise, Tony is impressed with Eloise and his son Ally takes an immediate liking to her. Mario offends her with prying questions about her husband's will and finances, causing Tony to confess that's the reason they were introduced. Eloise reveals to Tony that having lost both her husband and son, she appreciates the notion of being with someone again who needs her. An old pal, Jerry Marks, now a wealthy promoter, invites Tony to a party. Pretending to be more prosperous than he is, Tony explains his idea to buy a piece of land in Florida and open a second Disneyland there. Jerry seems interested in being his partner. He takes Tony to a dog-racing track, where Tony uses the $500 he earned from selling his car to match Jerry's large bet. His dog wins, but Jerry coaxes him into letting it ride in the next race on a dog called Lucky Ally. The obvious desperation in Tony's voice as he roots for the dog to win makes it clear that he is not a man of means. Jerry insults him afterward, and when Tony throws a handout back in his face, Tony is punched by one of Jerry's associates. Literally a beaten man, Tony decides the best thing for Ally is to go live with Mario and Sophie from now on, even telling the unconvinced boy that he's not wanted. Tony goes off to the beach by himself, but Ally runs out to be with him, and soon they are joined by Eloise.
