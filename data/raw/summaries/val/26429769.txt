Terrorists blow up a school bus in the Middle East, killing everyone on board. A U.S. Military operation sets out to find the terrorists. Meanwhile, a nuclear arms expert is sent to disarm a nuclear bomb that has accidentally fallen out of an airplane flying over the area. He and the military operation eventually meet and clash ideals as the operation decides to take possession of the nuke. Throughout the film, the operation pursues the terrorists and the nuke expert learns more about humanity through his relationship with a soldier in the operation, who survived the school bus disaster. In the end, all the terrorists and operation members die from various fights. The nuke expert alone survives and recalls his newfound discovery of the love of humanity. The nuke is left in the desert, presumably defused by another nuke expert.
