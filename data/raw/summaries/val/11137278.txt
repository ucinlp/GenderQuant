Because of genetic modifications, Black Mask has superhuman fighting and healing powers. He is searching for top geneticists around the world who might be able to reverse his modifications, which have blocked his emotions. Elsewhere, someone is augmenting the DNA of top pro-wrestlers with animal genomes, making them stronger and deadlier. The process is causing the wrestlers to become more like animals. Black Mask tries to help the wrestlers, but their boss has plans of his own.
