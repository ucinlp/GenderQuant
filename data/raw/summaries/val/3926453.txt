In this story, Franklin the turtle and his little sister, Harriet  are planning to pay a visit to their grandparents at Faraway Farm. Franklin immediately becomes annoyed with Harriet when she throws a snowball, causing him to drop a large pile of presents. Bear and Beatrice come, and Franklin accidentally forgets his favourite stuffed toy, Sam, at home. Franklin thinks that Harriet dumped Sam in the snow on purpose, when it was really Beatrice who had Sam after they left, and Bear failed to give it back to Franklin and Franklin is still annoyed with Harriet when they get to Faraway Farm and it's revealed that he and Harriet will be sleeping in the same room. Later, his grandmother tells a strange story about a reindeer. She admits that she might have imagined it as the father takes a family portrait, in which Franklin gives a sad look. Grandma sends Franklin to bed, and shows him Sirius outside. The next day, as Franklin feeds the chickens, Grandma lets him in on a little surprise-she is fixing up an old sleigh for Grandpa. Franklin decides to help, and Grandma introduces him to the Collies, who collect the polish. That night there is a blackout, and while Franklin is checking the closet for candles, he comes across the bell from his grandmother's story, revealing that she was not imagining after all. Franklin shows the bell to Grandma the next morning , and suggests they use the bell for Grandpa's sleigh. Grandma has Harriet help with the sleigh, but spills the beans at lunch . Later, as Franklin and Harriet work on the sleigh, Harriet rings the bell, and, just like in Grandma's story, a reindeer appears. Franklin runs to the house to tell Grandma, distracting Grandpa, making him slip on a puddle of ice, giving him a broken leg. Franklin decides to use the sleigh to go and find Dr. Bear in Woodland, when he discovers that Harriet has come along, hidden in the back. The horse, Rosie, is just as surprised, and runs away. Franklin is furious, but then sees that Harriet brought the bell. They ring it, and this time two reindeer come, one with a bell exactly like the one Franklin has. Franklin realizes that the bell must belong to the other reindeer, which is why he comes when somebody rings it. With the bell back, the original reindeer creates a harness seemingly out of nowhere. As they soar above the clouds he sees Sirius, and he and Harriet sing this song, "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star". They soon arrive home with Dr. Bear, who gives Grandpa a cast for his leg. She also gives Franklin Sam, which Bear got from the very beginning. That night, Franklin and Harriet see Santa Claus out the window. The film ends with Franklin and Harriet saying "Merry Christmas" to each other.
