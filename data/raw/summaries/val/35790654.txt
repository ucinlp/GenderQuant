Dharma  is an auto driver who kidnaps young women and is on the payroll of a powerful politician R.R . "Honest" Raj , a DCP investigating the murder of an MLA, zeroes in on R.R but is suspended by his higher-ups due to political pressure. Few years later, he is brought back when Governor's rule is established and given charge of the investigation into the disappearance of a man whose sister had earlier disappeared. His investigation leads him to Dharma and R.R and then to a private hospital in Bombay.
