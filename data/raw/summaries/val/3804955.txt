In the resort of Lake Waxapahachie, the swanky Wentworth Plaza is where the rich all congregate, and where the tips flow like wine. Handsome Dick Curtis  is working his way through medical school as a desk clerk, and when rich, penny-pinching Mrs. Prentiss  offers to pay him to escort her daughter Ann  for the summer, Dick can't say no â€“ even his fiancee, Arline Davis  thinks he should do it. Mrs. Prentiss wants Ann to marry eccentric middle-aged millionaire T. Mosley Thorpe , who's a world-renowned expert on snuffboxes, but Ann has other ideas. Meanwhile her brother, Humbolt  has a weakness for a pretty face: he's been married and bought out of trouble by his mother several times. Every summer, Mrs. Prentiss produces a charity show for the "Milk Fund", and this year she hires the flamboyant and conniving Russian dance director Nicolai Nicoleff  to direct the show. The parsimonious Mrs. Prentiss wants to spend the least amount possible, but Nicoleff and his set designer Schultz  want to be as extravagant as they can, so they can rake off more money for themselves, and for the hotel manager  and the hotel stenographer , who's blackmailing the hapless snuffbox fancier Thorpe. Of course, Dick and Ann fall in love, Humbolt marries Arline, and the show ends up costing Mrs. Prentiss an arm and a leg, but in the end she realizes that having a doctor in the family will save money in the long run.
