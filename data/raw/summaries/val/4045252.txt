A con man, a preacher and a prospector meet in the late 1800s and recall the story of a recent scandalous murder. A Southern gentleman, Colonel Wakefield, died and the notorious bandit Juan Carrasco was tried, convicted and condemned. Everyone's account on the witness stand differed dramatically. Carrasco claimed that the husband was tied up with ropes while the wife was assaulted, after which he killed the colonel in a duel. The wife contends that she was the one who killed her husband because he accused her of leading on Carrasco and causing the rape. A third witness, an old Indian, testifies that neither account is true. He insists that the colonel used a jeweled dagger to commit suicide after the incident. It turns out that there was a fourth witness, one with a completely new view of what actually took place, the prospector.
