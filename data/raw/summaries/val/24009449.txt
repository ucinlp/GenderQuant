Eddie Slocome  is a young country boy from a farm in Idaho who decides to volunteer to become a paratrooper because of his dreams to be like his uncle Charlie, a paratrooper in WWII. Upon arriving at Fort Bragg,NC he meets a motley crew of volunteers and draftees predictably all-white and from varying socio-economic backgrounds. Most notable are Rocky, the bully of the group, and Mouse,jive-talking, self-styled "lover" of the group, who both play important supporting roles in the film. There are also the two sargeants of the Company, the tough martinet Snr.Sgt. Benner and the more affable and pleasant but still tough Sgt. White . As a wet behind the ears, immature and naive farm-boy and bumpkin, Eddie is initially mocked by his peers for his wholesome ways and trusting manner, eventually however he earns their respect by his courage, honor, friendliness and his ability to be a good teammate and comrade despite not being the most skilled paratrooper. Drama develops when Eddie meets a doe-eyed country girl by the name of Jenny May and this provides the then necessary "love-interest" for the male lead and a diverting but unsatisfying, irrelevant sub-plot to the main theme of the film. Various ups and downs in the life and training of the main protagonist follow and in the end predictably everything and everyone lives happily ever after. The bully is shamed and humiliated and the hero and his now bosom-buddies become proud members of the US 82nd Airborne Division. The film features frequent scenes of training methods used by the US airborne division at the time and is an interesting document in this respect.
