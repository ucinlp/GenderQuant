Set in Los Angeles, the film begins with the nighttime robbery of an illegal mafia bookmaking operation carried out by the militant African-American organization BAG . Though successful, several of the bookmakers and one of the burglars are killed. The mastermind behind the robbery, a Vietnam-veteran named Scott , is the brother of prominent local nightclub owner, Gunn . Seeking safe-haven, Scott hides out at his brother's mansion after a brief reunion. Meanwhile, mafia caporegime and used-car dealer Russ Capelli  meets with west coast criminal overlord Toni Lombardo  to report the theft of daily payoff records and monies. Though Capelli receives an unrelated promotion for years of loyal service, he nonetheless fears the consequences of a loss of face and status as well as incriminating mob financial information. He therefore orders his men, led by psychotic assassin Ray Kriley , to shake down anyone who might have a connection to the robbery and to recover the lost goods using any means necessary.
