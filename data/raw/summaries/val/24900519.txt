Somewhere in New Zealand in the year 1986 three young men, Paul, Darryn and Sam, find themselves trapped in a Holden EH Station Wagon without fuel and surrounded by zombies. The film focuses on the interaction between the three as their conversations turn from their lack of food to their musical tastes to plans of escape. Darryn finds a can of petrol in the boot, and the three drill a hole in what they think is the feed line, but they unwittingly pour the fuel out of the bottom of the car. As the days draw on Sam's mental state deteriorates and he expresses a wish to die, and the other two, seeing him as potential food, attempt to stab him with a Swiss Army knife, but this proves unsuccessful and they relent. Sam eventually dies of his injuries, and Paul turns into a zombie after succumbing to a bite he sustained before the film began, forcing Darryn to decapitate him. After throwing Paul's head out of the window, he notices that the car is on top of a sewer entrance. Darryn escapes through the bottom of the car into the sewers, where he lights a cigarette in triumph, unwittingly setting off an explosion as a result of the gasoline that was poured down there. The closing scene of the film shows all three of the men in a bright white version of the car, implied to be Heaven.
