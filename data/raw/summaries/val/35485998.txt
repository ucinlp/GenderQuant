Porky's sailboat  is sailing off to the Boola-Boola islands, a fictitious set of tropical islands in the South Seas with enough cargo to open up a five and dime store. Thirteen days into the journey, Porky is writing in the Ship's Log that he is nearing land, "...I hope, I hope, I hope". A fish spots the Petunia coming his way and swims to the bottom of the ocean to tell his friends and says, "Hey guys, a ship is coming through!"  and they all swim to near the surface, just under the boat. A swordfish comes along and cuts a hole in the bottom of the boat and all of Porky's goods fall to the bottom of the ocean! As Porky falls out too, the swordfish pushes him back into the boat and closes up the hole. The swordfish unscrews his "sword" from his face, and gives it to a nearby fish to stand guard . Out of the sinking goods falls a lunchbox and when it hits bottom, opens up to form a canteen where a fish inside wearing a chef's hat is flipping burgers. A group of seahorses see a record player and as it starts playing, they swim onto the rotating record and form a merry-go-round. Smaller fish jump on their backs, imitating children on a ride. A fish swallows a teapot which whistles a tune while emitting steam and the opening and closing of the lid. Another fish swallows a clock with a moving pendulum and as he walks away, the pendulum keeps swinging. As Porky lifts the hole cover to see what happening , he gets water squirted in his face by the sentry fish. Another fish swallows a radio and as the radio announcer  is speaking, the fish looks around for someone speaking and does not realize the sound is coming from the radio. The announcer describes how two giant bombers dropped a bomb on a small village, and the fish goes through all the motions of the bombing and gunfire sounds . As the shelling comes to a stop, the fish wipes sweat from his brow, only to have a program called "Gangsta Busters" begin playing including the sounds of bombing and gunfire, and goes through all the motions again until he is bounced off the ocean floor which causes the radio to be up-chucked. Bowls and boxes are the next to follow, forming a hotel with a ballroom inside. Two electric eels swim by and form the marquee "Holly" and "wood" above the entrance and begin blinking on and off. Two other fish enter with flashlights on forming spotlights, as seen in front of hotels and theaters with big events and movie premiers in Hollywood that were common at the time. Two other fish have bowler hats drop on them, and as they turn toward the camera, acquire a likeness of Laurel and Hardy, and they swim into the Hotel. Another fish steps into some large shoes, and impersonates a Greta Garbo character and she says, "I want to be alone", a line in the 1932 classic Garbo movie "Grand Hotel". Another fish swallows an hourglass lamp and takes on the likeness of Mae West, complete with jewels and parasol, utters, "Come up and see me sometime" as she steps into the Hollywood Legion Stadium to watch a boxing match. There are two boxing fish fighting on the keys of a typewriter in the stadium, and as the carriage comes to the end of the line, the typewriter's ding is heard, and each fish backs into his own corner, and another fish pushes the carriage back to the beginning of a new line. The keys spell out what is happening in the fight. Back to Porky, he's now frowning because all of his goods have been lost, and puts a worm on a hook and lowers it into the water. The sentry fish sees this and pulls out his own fishing pole with baited hook and the worm jumps onto the hook and the sentry fish reels him in and eats him! Later, the ballroom guests are partying and waving their drinking glasses around when a spotlight appears on the curtain. As the curtain rises, we see some pretty dancing legs and as the curtain rises further, it turns out to be a 10-legged octopus! The Mae West fish dances with something resembling a walrus or seal; her bustline and his waistline fit together perfectly as they dance. The fish that swallowed the clock stands still as his hips move to the beat of the music. A whale appears under Porky's boat and the sentry fish knocks on the hole cover. As Porky opens the cover and says, "Who's there?" the whale spouts water from his blowhole, which forces Porky back onto the boat. A waterspout appears in the moonlit evening sky and as we see the dancing fish again, the announcer comes on and says there's a waterspout approaching the Boola-Boola islands. The fish casually go back to their dancing until he says, "Well, come on you guys, SCRAM!" and all of the fish panic and run for their lives. The force of the waterspout picks up all of the goods and drops them back into the Petunia, and Porky sails off into the distance. The sentry fish spits water, and Porky comes back and sprays him with a spritzer-bottle, and the fish starts crying and the cartoon comes to a close.
