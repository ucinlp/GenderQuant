The film concerns the late coming of age of protagonist Gavin Lamb , a painfully shy 31-year-old virgin still living at home with his parents and who works as a hairdresser in a West End salon. The socially awkward Gavin forges sudden romantic connections with three very different women: a sultry millionairess , an idiosyncratic recluse , and a single mother  who is a junior hairdresser at his salon.
