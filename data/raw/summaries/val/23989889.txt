The film first looks at Grigori Alexandrov, a director who made his career in 1930s musicals. He directed the unlikely hit, Jolly Fellows  which, with the backing of Maxim Gorky, and the personal approval of Stalin. Alexandrov went on to create other propagandistic musicals, including Volga, Volga , which details the story of peasants who boat to Moscow on the River Volga to become singers. These musicals starred his wife, Lyubov Orlova. Next, the film examines East German musical films, including the wildly successful My Wife Wants to Sing , which earned a great deal of money but its Western message of personal ambition may not have gelled with critics. Ultimately, the freezing that came with the creation of the Berlin Wall and the end of Prague Spring doomed these musicals to the dustbin of history.
