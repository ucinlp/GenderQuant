 Naive country girl Lili  arrives in a provincial town in hopes of locating an old friend of her late father's, only to find that he has also died. A local shopkeeper offers her employment and a meal, then tries to take advantage of her. She is rescued by a handsome, smooth-talking, womanizing carnival magician, Marc, whose stage name is Marcus the Magnificent . Lili is infatuated with him and follows him to the carnival where, on learning that she is only 16, he decides to help her get a job as waitress. Lili is fired on her first night when she spends her time watching the magic act instead of waiting tables. When Lili consults the magician for advice, he tells her to go back to where she came from. Homeless and heartbroken, she contemplates suicide, unaware that she is being watched by the carnival's puppeteer Paul . He stops her by striking up a conversation with her through his puppets &mdash; a brash red-haired boy named Carrot Top, a sly fox named Reynardo, a vain ballerina named Marguerite, and a cowardly giant named Golo the Giant. Soon a large group of carnival workers gather and are enthralled watching Lili's direct interaction with the puppets, as she is seemingly unaware that there is a puppeteer behind the curtain. Afterwards, Paul and his partner Jacquot  offer Lili a job in the act, talking with the puppets. She accepts and her natural and pure manner of interacting with the puppets becomes the most valuable part of the act. Paul was once a well-known dancer, but suffered a leg injury in World War II. He regards the puppet show as far inferior to his old career, which embitters him. Lili refers to him as "the Angry Man." Although he falls in love with Lili, he can only express his feelings through the puppets. Fearing rejection due to his physical impairment, he keeps his distance by being consistently unpleasant to her, even as Jacquot warns him that he is driving Lili away. Lili continues to dream about the handsome magician, wishing to replace his sexy assistant Rosalie . Soon, Marcus receives an offer to perform at the local casino and decides to leave the carnival, much to the joy of Rosalie, who can now announce to everyone that she is his wife. Lili is heartbroken and innocently invites Marc to her trailer. His lecherous plans are interrupted by Paul, and he leaves. When Lili finds his wedding ring and tries to chase after him, she is stopped by Paul who calls her a fool and hits her. Lili runs off to think. Two impresarios from Paris who have been scouting the show for a few days come to see Paul and Jacquot. They soon recognize Paul as the former dancer, and tell him that his current act with Lili and the puppets is ingenious. Paul is ecstatic about this and the offer, but Jacquot tells the agents that they will have to let them know at a later time. He tells Paul in private that Lili is leaving. Lili takes the wedding ring to Marc and tells him that every little girl grows up and has to wake up from her girlish dreams and open her eyes. She has decided to leave the carnival. On her way out she is stopped by the familiar voices of Carrot Top and Reynardo, who ask her to take them with her. As they embrace her, she finds they are shaking. She remembers there is actually somebody behind the curtain, and pulls it away to see Paul. Instead of telling her how he feels and asking her to stay, he tells her of the agents' offer. She confronts him about the difference between his real self, seemingly incapable of love, and his puppets. He tells her he is the puppets, each and all, a creature of many facets and many flaws, as is any other man. He concludes by telling her, "this is business." "Not anymore," retorts Lili, who turns and walks away. Walking the lonely road out of town, she imagines that the puppets, now life-size, have joined her. As she dances joyfully with Carrot Top, he turns into Paul. Dismayed, she draws back, and he fades away. Facing the other three, Marguerite brings her along next, but then she, too, turns into Paul and fades away. She begins to realize that what Paul said about being all the puppets is true, and slowly walks to Reynardo and dances with him. When he, too, turns into Paul and runs away, she throws herself into the arms of Golo, the last puppet, who turns into Paul and stays with her, dancing. Coming back to reality, Lili runs back to the carnival and into Paul's waiting arms. They kiss passionately as the puppets applaud.
