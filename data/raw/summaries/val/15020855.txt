Lake Placid 2 continues the story of that sleepy lake community, taking place a few years after the ending of the first film. The story of the crocodiles has become simple folklore within the town. There is a new sheriff in town, Sheriff Riley, played by John Schneider. The crocodile myth resurfaces when a researcher is plucked from his boat in the presence of his colleague. A member of the Fish and Wildlife department, Emma, who is also a woman with whom Sheriff Riley has a somewhat tumultuous history, comes to town to investigate these allegations. Together they go to the lake to investigate the disturbance. While there, Emma discovers the severed head of the missing man. On the way back, the group stops by crazy old Sadie's house, sister to the now deceased Delores Bickerman from the first film. Sadie proves to be a stubborn old woman who refuses to aid in the investigation. After their visit to Sadie's proves fruitless, the team heads back to town, but they run into trouble by way of a hungry twenty-foot crocodile that destroys the Sheriff's boat. As the team swims to shore, a seaplane flies overhead and lands, revealing poacher Sam MacMurray and his ally Ahmad. Almost immediately the team is attacked, on land this time, by the crocodile. As the team continues to try to solve the crocodile in the lake issue, it is revealed that Sadie has in fact been a part of the problem, feeding these giants hormone enhanced meat that has been rejected by the government. The plot thickens when it is revealed that there are four enormous crocodiles, and that two of them have mated, leaving a nest full of gigantic crocodile eggs.
