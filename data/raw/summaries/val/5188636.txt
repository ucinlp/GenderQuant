Finster , a 35-year-old man who resembles a baby, makes a successful robbery of the Last National Bank by the swift use of stilts, dark clothes, a pram and baby clothing. With him dressed in baby attire, he easily evades the police.  Finster loses his money down Bugs' rabbit hole  and he gets himself unofficially adopted in order to gain it back. Multiple attempts to grab it  are interpreted as a baby's typical grabbiness. Finster even points a revolver  at Bugs and shoots him but this still does not fully register with Bugs. Just as Bugs is putting the 'baby' to bed, Finster hits Bugs with a baseball bat; he assumes the baby is having a nightmare. A supposedly remorseful Finster grabs Bugs and hugs him saying: "dada!" Later, Bugs is trying to watch TV when he gets distracted by a buzzing noise in the bathroom. Looking inside, Bugs finds Finster is in the bathroom shaving himself, smoking a cigar, and wearing a tattoo . A brief news clip about the bank robbery and an APB for the robber finally makes Bugs realize what's really going on. It is interesting to note that if the story is assumed to take place in 1954, the date of the cartoon's release, Ant Hill Harry would have been 13 years old when he got the tattoo. He puts the bank robber in a washing machine and when Finster is washed up, Bugs takes him out and throws him up to the ceiling. Finster hits the ceiling and falls to the floor, and Bugs picks him up. At one point, Finster tries to stab Bugs but stabs himself in the rear. He murmurs inaudible obscenities, causing Bugs to spank him, removing the weapons he has with each blow. Bugs trusses Finster up in a basket like a baby and leaves him and the money at the police station. Finster does not take it well, throwing a wild temper tantrum while locked up in a baby sized playpen in the State Prison. Bugs ends the cartoon, telling the angry bank robber: "Don't be such a crybaby. After all, 99 years isn't forever!"
