Speedy is freezing in his mountaintop cabin, and so asks Daffy if he can borrow some firewood. The ever-greedy duck stubbornly refuses, prompting Speedy to steal some wood so he can survive. Ripostes on both sides are thrown, including a stick of dynamite for Speedy, mousetraps and chocolate-covered ice logs for Daffy, and finally Speedy accidentally hurtling a snowball into Daffy's hacienda. Beaten and out of both firewood and home, Daffy disguises himself as a mouse and asks to lodge up with Speedy, who agrees. Shrugging, Daffy tells the audience, "I always say, if you can't beat em, join em." Iris out.
