At the airport, he meets Romi Latti and Suhani , a young girl who has come to pick Romi up. Suraj gets attracted to Suhani, and therefore he pretends to be Romi and leaves with Suhani. When Suhani finds out that he is not the real Romi, Suraj makes a run into happy-go-lucky Goldie's flat, where he starts living. While Suraj visits a supermarket, he finds that Australians are attacking the Muslim shopkeeper, and approaches them with a gun, when one of the attackers points out "See no evil, hear no evil!", Suraj runs away. Suraj hides in Nicole's car. She works in a strip club named 'Duke's Club'. Suraj decides to be Suhani's brother- Samarth's  driver. When Samarth's car breaks down, Suraj instead of helping tells Romi to go fix his car so Suhani and Suraj can spent a night together. Soon enough, Romi is attacked by Australians, and all the Indians start to protest, and suddenly Samarath attacks David  and police arrest Samarth.
