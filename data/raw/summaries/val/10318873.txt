Terry Hawkins  has just been released after spending a year in state prison on drug charges. He wants to get into filmmaking, and claims he previously made pornographic films that he was unable to sell. Hawkins believes audiences want something more, so he decides to make snuff films. Victims are lured to an abandoned building; there they are murdered in elaborate ways for the films, including by decapitation or receiving a power drill to the head. Hawkins is complimented on how realistic his films look.
