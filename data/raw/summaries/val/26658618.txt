Abigail Scanlon and Parker Wald are best friends since childhood who return to their small hometown of Lambert, Louisiana from New York City for a visit. After running into old friends, they learn that their close friend, Rachel, has lost the love of her life, Tony, to their ex-friend, Caitlin, a conniving gold-digger who pretends to be pregnant to trick Tony into marrying her. Intent upon preventing a loveless marriage, Parker and Abigail go "undercover" as Caitlin's bridesmaids to sabotage the wedding. Along the way, Caitlin's tightly-wound mother, Olivia, works hard to keep Abigail and Parker at bay as Parker falls for the town detective and one of Tony's groomsman, Henry. The bridesmaids put their best-laid plans in motion only to see them go outrageously awry. As a result, the trio are arrested by Henry, but Parker convinces him to release them. So Abigail, Parker, and Rachel sneak into the wedding and kidnap Caitlin. They take her to the hospital for a pregnancy test and trick her into admitting the truth. At the wedding ceremony Tony lies to Caitlin that his family lost their fortunes which leads to her canceling the wedding and storming off. After Caitlin is gone, Tony gets on one knee and proposes to Rachel and revels that lied and he is still rich. At the end of the film, Parker stars in a major action film, Rachel marries Tony, and Abigail sells her book on their antics as bridesmaids.
