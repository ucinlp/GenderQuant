The plot centers around the Marchetta sisters, Tanzie  and Ava , rich, spoiled Hollywood socialites who enjoy material things such as shopping and dating, rather than caring about their late father's cosmetics company. When a major media scandal involving one of the company's products turns into an investigation, the girls find their assets frozen and must adjust to life without their fortune. Just when it seems like things could not get any worse, disaster strikes again. When a fire starts in their home, Ava quickly takes all her clothes while Tanzie, caring about her father more, takes with her his TiVo and some clothes. They are tempted to listen to their advisors and sell the company to their biggest competitor, Fabiella , for over $60 million each. Though this means that they could return to the lifestyle they were accustomed to, they decide to honor their father's memory by trying to turn it around themselves. Finding inspiration in Erin Brockovich, the girls decide to get to the root of the scandal. They use their good looks and charming personalities to win the case and prove their father's innocence. In the end, the girls successfully manage to clear the Marchetta name and reclaim the company. Nearly six months after the scandal began, the girls are seen leading the company, with Ava as the CEO and Tanzie working as a lab technician, with them both finding their true loves - for Tanzie, lab technician Rick and for Ava, lawyer Henry.
