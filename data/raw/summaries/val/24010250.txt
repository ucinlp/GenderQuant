Two truck drivers from Brooklyn travel to Mexico to deliver an elephant named "Bunny", but they have lost the address of where Bunny is to be delivered to. Adopting the elephant as their own, the two stumble into a travelling carnival headed by Alberto Cordoba and his daughter Nita. The carnival is destitute and menaced by loan sharks. The two Americans sell Bunny to the carnival to replace their recently departed flea circus but agree not to accept their payment until the carnival regains its fortune thanks to Bunny and Brooklyn "ballyhoo". The loan sharks attempt a variety of dirty tricks against the gringos. The title comes from a furious Nita turning a compressed air pellet firing machine gun carnival attraction on the Americans.
