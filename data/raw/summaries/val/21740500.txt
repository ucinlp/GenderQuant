Why We Bang starts by depicting a short history of African-American organizations and communities during the 60's and 70's such as the Black Panthers. It is then suggested that these organizations were infiltrated by the CIA, eventually leading to the division of the then more unified African-American community, and again leading to the establishment of new violent street gangs. After this interviews with several current and former members, and relatives, of the Los Angeles street gangs the Crips and Bloods are shown, with changing contexts. This ranges from being about why the interviewed are involved in gang activity, to the problems and trouble with the gangs and eventually to if and how the problems can be solved. A part of the film does for example follow a number of mothers of sons who has been murdered by gang violence talking about their experiences and views. A Nation of Islam leader is also amongst those followed by interviews through the film.
