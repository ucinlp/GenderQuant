The series begins with Scarlett attending the funeral of Melanie Wilkes, her ex-sister-in-law and rival for Ashley Wilkes' affection, at which her estranged husband, Rhett Butler, is not present. She, heartbroken that he left her, sets out for Tara and is saddened when she learns that Mammy, her mainstay since birth, is dying. When she arrives there, she sends a telegram to notify Rhett about Mammy under the name of Will Benteen , because she knows that he won't come if he suspects she is there. Before Mammy passes away she makes him swear to look after "her lamb" Miss Scarlett. He agrees, although he has no intention of honoring the request. After she dies, he and Scarlett have another snipe filled encounter, which culminates in him leaving and her returning to the Atlanta house, determined to win him back.  This section is practically identical to that of the book regarding Scarlett's actions at the funeral and Mammy's death bed.  The major differences in Charleston are that of the attitude and demeanors of the characters, but most notably Scarlett and Anne. Scarlett is not shown struggling with her unease in society but rather is criticized when Anne sees her and Ashley go into his hotel room together, resulting in a steamy kiss. Anne is completely different from her counterpart in the novel; while she is supposed to be a clone of Melanie, she shyly, yet coyly, flirts with Rhett and does other things that neither her character in the book nor Melanie never would have done. The series continues to follow the relationship created between them after the book ceases doing so.  Scarlett continues to distance herself from the same character in the novel as her relationship with her kin is not discovering and assimilating her Irish heritage and family, as much as escaping from her grandfather's household and passing the time. Her decision to go to Ireland is also preceded by cutting off all ties to America as well as the details concerning buying her sister Carreen's share of Tara, which had been donated to the convent as a dowry when she became a nun.  Once in Ireland, Scarlett is faced with two main problems, not the source of her struggles in the novel. She is pursued by Lord Richard Fenton, of whom none of her kin approve. She also faces quandaries and mixed feelings regarding physical force the Irish rebels against British rule, highlighted by comparisons of how they are being treated by the English to how the South was treated by the North.  Scarlett keeps her daughter's birth a secret from Rhett to spite him, thinking that if she grows up not knowing him she will not be like Bonnie, and that she will not love him; eventually, he will meet her and realize that she does not love or even know him and Scarlett will have her revenge. Katie is barely talked about outside of this - her role as the possible manifestation of a demon is completely removed. Anne Hampton-Butler also comes to Ireland with Rhett, which never happened in the novel, and even has a lengthy conversation with Scarlett. Her death from yellow fever is also detailed.  Lord Fenton is much more evil than his role in the novel. He forces a servant girl to have sex with him, and rapes Scarlett as well. The servant girl kills him when he does this, but Scarlett is blamed. This is where the plot completely veers from the one in the novel; she is put on trial and Rhett comes to her aid, finding out about Katie. It is also learned that Colum was killed by Lord Fenton for trying to get him to support the servant girl because she was pregnant with his child. She is very reluctant to confess, but after Scarlett is found guilty of murder, she does. Rhett and Scarlett decide to travel the world with Katie.
