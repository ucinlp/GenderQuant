The film opens with the story of two mystical brothers "Thunder" and "Lightning" powerful demons with control over storms, and brothers to dragons who threaten an ancient Japanese lord who agrees to give them his beautiful daughter in exchange for their boon and mercy. However one of his soldiers, who is in love with her has a sword created with magic to defeat Thunder and Lightning, trapping them within the blade for all time. Though safe, the lord's honor is wounded by this treacherous act, and in an act of vengeance summons the gods to turn the soldier to stone. He then meets with his daughter, waiting for her rescuer's return and kills her. In modern Japan, a folklore expert Professor Sakai obtains the scrolls telling these stories and is suddenly possessed by the spirits of Thunder and Lightning, driving him mad and in search of the sword that possesses their spirits. After he attacks one of his associates; an antique sword collector, the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense is alerted and Hellboy, Kate Corrigan, and a psychic Russell Thorne are called with a team to investigate. While there, Hellboy picks up a discarded samurai sword and vanishes. Finding himself in a different world, Hellboy is told by a wise kitsune that the sword is the Sword of Storms, containing the spirits of Thunder and Lightning and the goal of his journey lies to the west. During his time there, Hellboy encounters several mythical Yōkai who try to steal the sword from him including the kappa, a giant oni, a trio of rokurokubi, a Jorōgumo, Gashadokuro, tengu, Yomotsu-shikome, and three restless ghosts. Hellboy also meets a group of nukekubi in a segment of the film that is adapted almost verbatim from the comic book story, Heads. Each of them outsmarted and defeated by the wayward demon. Meanwhile, while investigating his disappearance Abe Sapien and Liz Sherman are called to the sites of disturbing earthquakes and discovers that dragons are burrowing their way up from under the ground and under the ocean. After being confronted by the same kitsune who guided Hellboy, they are instructed they must stop the dragons from emerging. Which Liz manages to hold back using her pyrokinetic abilities. After being attacked by animated objects of folklore, Corrigan and Thorne follow Sakai to a shrine featuring a stone warrior, at the same time, Hellboy is tricked into destroying the sword, returning him to the shrine and releasing Thunder and Lightning, freeing Sakai from the curse. After an intense battle, Hellboy manages to trick both spirits back into the sword, and as a result, the emerging dragons all over the world are sealed back into the underworld for good. The spirits of the maiden and lord inhabit Corrigan and Thorne and the spirit of the soldier returns. He and Hellboy both manage to convince the lord not to kill his daughter, breaking the cycle of their unending deaths. The spirits depart, thankful to Hellboy and the others for helping them.
