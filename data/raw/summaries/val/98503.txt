The film begins with Alfie Elkins  ending a relationship with a married woman  and getting the woman from another of his affairs, Gilda , pregnant. The film then follows his life for a few years, documenting events that lead to the character's emotional growth, starting with the birth of his son. Alfie has a health check in case of hereditary diseases, but his inability to commit to the child's mother leads to her marrying a bus conductor . The health check reveals Alfie has tubercular shadows on his lungs, and this, combined with being banned from seeing his son, leads him to have a brief breakdown. Alfie then spends time in a convalescent home. Here he meets Harry , who confronts him about his delusion that he is doing no harm, and Harry's wife , whom he gets pregnant in a one-night stand. Later on in the film, the ensuing abortion is a turning point for the character, and the only time other than his passing out/breakdown where he exhibits real emotion—breaking down in tears at the sight of the aborted foetus. In the meantime, he meets Ruby , who is an older, voluptuous, affluent and promiscuous American, while freelancing taking holiday photos of tourists near the Tower of London. Later, as a car-hire chauffeur, he picks up a young hitchhiker, Annie  from Sheffield, looking to make a fresh start in London, who moves in with him. She proves preoccupied with a love left behind, scrubbing Alfie's floor, doing his laundry, and preparing his meals to compensate. He grows resentful of the relationship and drives her out with an angry outburst, too late regretting what he has just done. Near the film's close, Alfie decides to change his non-committal ways and settle down, albeit with the rich Ruby. The day he chooses to suggest this to her, he finds a younger man in her bed, leaving him disheartened at the film's end and wondering “What's it all about? You know what I mean.” The film is unusual in that it has no opening credits and the end credits feature photos of the principal actors, as well as of the main technical crew, including director Lewis Gilbert and cameraman Otto Heller.
