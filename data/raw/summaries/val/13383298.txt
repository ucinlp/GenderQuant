William Nessen, an American freelance journalist, travels to Aceh, Indonesia to cover the conflict which was taking place there at the time. Shot over a period of four years, The Black Road follows Nessen as he transforms from being an objective journalist to a supporter of the Free Aceh Movement . Nessen, as his collection of footage grew, thought of making a film. This idea would later evolve into The Black Road. Nessen and Marhaban were married in Aceh. Only a few days after the wedding Nessen’s best man, a human rights activist, was kidnapped and murdered by Indonesian security forces.<ref name7417 Reporters sans frontières - Indonesia]{{cite news| urlBBC News | title3 August 2003 | accessdate17277 Reporters sans frontières - Indonesia: Officials deny entry to US journalist who covered war in Aceh from rebels’ side]
