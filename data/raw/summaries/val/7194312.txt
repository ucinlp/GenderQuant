Aravind meets a woman named Anjali, and falls in love with her at first sight despite not knowing anything about her. His friends agree to help him search for her. Once located, Anjali tells Aravind that she would like to try a trial-romance for a week, which may lead to a long-term romance. Meanwhile, Aravind's best friend, the Assistant Commissioner of Police and his wife, are separated, but yet not legally divorced. He wants her back, but she does not wish to reunite with him. What Aravind does not know is that Anjali is their daughter, and that she is staying in a hostel because she refuses to acknowledge them as her parents until they reunite. The father convinces her to dispense with this trial romance, and make a deeper commitment to Aravind, who he says is a good man. Aravind vows to convince Anjali's mother to support him as her suitor, while a London man wishes to court her himself.
