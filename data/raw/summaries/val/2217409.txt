Chizuko also clashes with the mother over her grandson, who has been playing truant at school. Eventually Mrs Toda and Setsuko decide to move out to the unsold dilapidated apartment by the sea, instead of harassing Setsuko's second sister, Ayako , for a place to stay. Ayako and her husband are more than happy to let them stay elsewhere. The death anniversary of the father soon arrives, and the family comes together for a ceremonial gathering. Shojiro arrives on time for the family dinner. However, he is shocked to learn that his mother and Setsuko are staying alone by the sea. He reprimands each and every one of his brother and sisters in turn sternly, rebuking them for not doing their part as children, and urges them to leave for home at once, which they do. After dinner, Shojiro asks his mother and sister to stay with him at Tianjin in China. The two agree. Setsuko tries to matchmake Shojiro and her friend Tokiko , who has come for a visit, but Shojiro runs off to the beach before she can get them to meet.
