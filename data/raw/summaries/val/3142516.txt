This is the story of a girl named Wendy Reed, who leaves the USA and her boyfriend, a musician played by Michael Cerveris, and travels to Tokyo, Japan. She plans to visit a girlfriend but cannot find her. Instead she meets a young man called Hiro , who is the leader of an unsuccessful pop band. As Wendy is blonde and tall by local standards, she attracts attention. She falls in love with Hiro and develops a music career as the movie advances. With some tricks they manage to catch the eye of a record label producer and achieve success for a short time. The song, which is played throughout, is a cover version from John Sebastian's Do you believe in magic? While they top the charts, there is some luxury in their lives, but the blossoming relationship of the main couple starts breaking apart. In the movie, Tokyo Pop is a one day business where groups have one hit in the charts and then vanish forever. Since this is the case, Wendy goes back to the US in hopes of finding a more stable career. She had an unforgettable time with Hiro but can leave him behind because he is a marvelous composer, who will find his way through his own power. He no longer needs her to garner the attention of producers. The film ends with a tearful duet between the two; she, in a US studio singing about her love for him and he, on a Japanese stage replying in kind. The duet showcases his artistic music skills.
