In the year 1793, 17 years after Jeongjo became the King of Joseon, a series of murders occur. King Jeongjo believes the murders may belong to a conspiracy by government officials to cover up tributary payments. King Jeongjo then gives Detective K  a secret order to find out who is behind the killings.
