This story takes place in an orchestra featuring, among other instruments, a piccolo, a flute, an oboe, a clarinet, a bassoon, a trumpet, a French horn, a trombone, a tuba , a violin, a cello, a double bass, a xylophone, cymbals, timpani, and a piano. Tubby, the orchestra's tuba, comments after a rehearsal's warmup that he is tired of playing only the bass line. This draws ridicule from the other instruments, and Tubby runs off crying to a nearby creek. A frog who lives there consoles Tubby; both are treated poorly, as neither is thought to be capable or worthy of a solo. The frog teaches Tubby a melody and the two part ways. The next day, at the warmup, Tubby begins playing his newly-learned melody. The orchestral instruments are shocked, but are encouraged to let the tuba have his solo by their conductor. With the frog's help, Tubby gets to play his solo.
