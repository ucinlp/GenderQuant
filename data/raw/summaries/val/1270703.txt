The film is circular in plot as well as in a number of other ways . The film is centered around an incestuous love relationship between step-siblings. The two meet one day after school, when Ana's father dies, and her mother marries his father. Ana believes that Otto is the reincarnation of her father, but eventually the two of them fall in love. For a number of reasons, they are eventually separated, and Otto becomes a pilot flying between Spain and the Arctic Circle. Ana moves to the same area to leave behind her past and past lovers, and tries to get in touch with him again. In the end, however, one of the main characters dies in a freak accident. Told by Ana's point of view, she and Otto are reunited, and in Otto's point of view, Ana dies. The deaths and lives of the characters are made more confusing through anachronisms and plot details.
