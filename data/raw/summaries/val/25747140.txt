Milwaukee, WI Police Department Inspector Paul Fein  is a veteran police commander whose son Ben is a senior police detective, and his son Eddie  is also a cop assigned to the department's Patrol Bureau. Paul is assigned to investigate the murder of a prominent businessman, and he soon learns that the field of suspects has been narrowed down to twoâ€”the victim's sexually freewheeling wife Anna , and Paul's wild-child daughter Jackie . Neither Paul, Ben, nor Eddie believe that Jackie could have committed the murder, and soon Paul is using himself as a decoy in a bid to find out more about what Anna does and doesn't know about her husband's death.
