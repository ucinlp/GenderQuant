Jagathalaprathapan was based on the fantasy story of a prince who is to be punished from his kingdom for expressing his desire for four celestial maidens, Indrani, Nagakumari, Agnikumari and Varunakumari. The prince, however, escapes punishment and roams in disguise in the company of a friend when he meets a damsel who is Indirakumari in disguise. He marries her and settles down in a kingdom whose king falls in love with his wife and sends the prince away to Nagaloka in order to covet her. The prince, however, succeeds in finding Nagakumari in Nagaloka, Agnikumari in Agniloka and Varunakumari in Varunaloka and succeeds in winning them as wives.
