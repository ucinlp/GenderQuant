Taking the expedition of a group of Frenchmen following in the tracks of their fellow countrymen as a starting point, Bougafer 33 is a journey through time and space that tells of the battle that took place in 1933 at the foot of the Bougafer Mountain during the war Morocco fought against the French-Spanish colonial conquest. Eyewitness accounts, stock footage, written tales and songs all contribute to reinstate the history of the last resistants of the Ait Atta. An epic ordeal of fierce and highly organized battles in which women and children took part in the name of freedom.
