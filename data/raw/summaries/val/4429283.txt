Hondo Lane  arrives on foot at a ranch where Mrs. Angie Lowe  and her son Johnny  have been deserted by her husband for months. Part Apache, Hondo tries to avoid confrontation with war chief Vittorio , but finally bails out inexperienced West Point graduate Cavalry Lieutenant  and old friend scout Buffalo . When Hondo finally admits he had to kill Mr Lowe  in self-defense, Angie reveals her husband was a gambler, unfaithful, unkind, and only married her for her inheritance. She disagrees with Hondo's devotion to "truth", calls his desire to confess to Johnny selfish, and asks to leave with him and the remains of a wagon train heading towards his farm that looks just like hers.
