In Paris at the end of the First World War, Sylvia Suffolk and British officer Tony Clyde get married, shortly before Tony leaves for the front. Sylvia, newly pregnant, is given the news that Tony is dead while working as a nurse for surgeon René Gaudin. Sylvia gradually falls in love with René, but is reluctant to remarry since she has no official news of Tony's death. On holiday in Switzerland with René, Sylvia is shocked to find Tony is still alive, and convalescing, and now finds herself torn between duty to Tony and marriage to René.
