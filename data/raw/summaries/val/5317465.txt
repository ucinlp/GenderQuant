The movie begins with Doctor Stoner  selling a strange large 'snake' to a carnival man . College student David Blake  is hired as an assistant by Stoner, an ophiologist. It transpires that Stoner's previous assistant had mysteriously left town without telling anyone . Stoner begins David on a course of injections, purportedly as a safeguard against being bitten by a snake in his care. David's skin starts to change and even peel like a snakeskin. David begins a romance with Stoner's daughter Kristina , although her father objects and insists that she does not have any sexual relations with him. David becomes increasingly perturbed by the strange side effects of the injections. Kristina visits a carnival freak show and is alarmed that the "snakeman" bears an uncanny resemblance to Stoner's previous assistant. She leaves in terror and heads back to save David who is currently mutating into a cobra. David starts to turn green, suffers breathing problems and develops scales on his body. Stoner is bitten by the original cobra and killed instantly, after David's transformation is complete. The new cobra  is finally killed by a mongoose when he tries to escape. Kristina arrives home and finds her father killed with the original cobra next to him. At the same time the police arrive, and shoot the original cobra, before heading to the lab where the mongoose is attacking David's neck, attempting to kill him. The police do not have a clear shot, as Kristina screams David's name...
