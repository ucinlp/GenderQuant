When their mother dies, a brother and sister are left orphaned. Having sold all their possessions to settle debts they also become homeless and destitute. They set out to find a better life, away from their painful memories. Taking shelter in a remote temple, they encounter an ascetic holy man who allows them to stay there. With the spiritual help of the ascetic and the monetary assistance of an unhappy dancer, the boy's indomitable spirit and indefatigable energy enable the pair to overcome a series of setbacks including the loss of the girl's sight and the sickness of her fianc√©. Such is the example set by the boy that both the dancer and the ascetic feel their lives have been enriched by knowing him.
