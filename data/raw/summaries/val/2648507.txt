Wide receiver Phil Elliott plays for a 1970s era professional football team based in Dallas, Texas named the North Dallas BullsTELEVISION & FILM HELMETSMovie/TV helmets, which closely resembles the Dallas Cowboys. The aging Elliott is struggling to stay competitive and relies heavily on painkillers. Elliott and popular quarterback Seth Maxwell are outstanding players, but they also characterize the drug-, sex-, and alcohol-fueled party atmosphere of NFL teams of that era. Elliott only wants to play the game, retire, and own a home with his girlfriend Charlotte. The Bulls play for an iconic coach who turns a blind eye to anything that his players may be doing off the field or anything that his assistant coaches and trainers condone to keep those players in the game. As one player finally erupts to a coach: "Every time I call it a game, you call it a business. And every time I call it a business, you call it a game."
