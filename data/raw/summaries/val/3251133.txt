Meanwhile, the butler of Caryle Castle, Smithee, is told by Dargis to go to London to get his new suit. He finds Garfield and Odie during their travels and mistakes him for Prince, bringing him to the castle and leaving Odie alone. Prince manages to get out of a gutter in front of Odie, to his confusion. Jon finds the two and, mistaking Prince for Garfield, takes them back to his hotel room. At the castle, the animals realize that Garfield is not Prince, due to his voice and attitude, but are not concerned as he just needs to look like him to fool the solicitors into thinking Prince has returned.

Prince spots Carlyle Castle on the map, and sets off to return to the palace. Jon realizes that Garfield is gone and goes off with Odie to find him.

Liz, however, has arrived at the castle for the convention, and Garfield finds Dargis hitting on Liz. Garfield distracts Dargis, and is subsequently thrown in a dungeon underneath the castle. Jon meets up with Smithee and after explaining the story, he decides to come with them. Garfield is rescued by Winston. but decides to head back to London, citing Winston's earlier remarks about him being simply a housecat. On his way out, he comes face to face with Prince in a "fake mirror" scene, each copying the other's movements until Garfield fools Prince into fainting. Prince explains that he had been living Garfield's life for the last three days, and that he should return to his owner, but Garfield tells them that they should fight Dargis, and decides to stay. The animals set traps all over the palace, with Garfield and Prince luring him into the traps. They manage to run him around the entire castle, making the solicitors believe he has gone crazy. Jon and Odie arrive as Dargis gets a crossbow and aims it at the cats and the solicitors, forcing them to sign the deed of the castle over to him. Odie bites Dargis on the butt, making him throwing the cross bow away. Dargis takes out a gun and holds Liz hostage, but Nigel the ferret enters Dargis' pants, and he is soon punched out by Jon and falls to the floor. Smithee brings out troops of the police to arrest him. Liz sees Garfield and Prince, not knowing the difference between the two of them. Garfield kicks Odie off the chair they are sitting on in order to prove who is who. Jon takes out the ring and proposes to Liz.
