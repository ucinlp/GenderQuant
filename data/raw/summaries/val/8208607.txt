The movie picks up directly after the end of Rescue From Gilligan's Island. The castaways are once again stranded on the same island that they had been on for so many years. The storm has contaminated all of the underground springs, and they are desperately searching for fresh water. Gilligan stumbles upon a couple of planes that are hidden in the jungle that they had somehow managed to overlook during all their time on the island. It is revealed that the island was a base of operations for the Army Air Corps during World War II, and the hangar was abandoned and overgrown by jungle brush. The tidal wave destroyed the foliage and exposed the hangar. The Professor believes that he can combine the two planes into one and fly them all back to civilization. He succeeds in cobbling together an airworthy plane and, dubbing it Minnow III, they head back. This occurs despite the fact that in the original series it is established that the Professor cannot fly a plane in not one but two different episodes with the character Wrongway Feldman. However, during the attempt to fly back to Hawaii, the plane has engine trouble. The professor orders Gilligan to jettison some weight, and in doing so, Gilligan falls out and has to parachute down to the island. Against their better judgment, the gang decides to return to the island to get him. They find him stuck in a tree. After a little while, the engines of the plane fall off. Fortunately for them, the engines collapse after they land, meaning that although they are still stuck on the island, going back to get Gilligan saved them from plummeting to their deaths as the engines would have fallen off in midair. But now they are dismayed because the plane was their last hope of rescue. Their despair is quickly dispelled when a U.S. Navy captain appears saying that their plane was detected on radar long enough for them to follow it to the island. The castaways are once again returned to civilization and to ensure that Gilligan's Island gets charted, the U.S. government pinpoints the location of the island to prevent future castaway incidents. This closed the first half of the two-part episode/movie. The second half — which was originally intended as a pilot for a Love Boat type of weekly series — picks up a year later, with the island now a tropical resort fully linked to civilization and owned by Mr. Howell . The rest of the castaways work as the staff of the resort. Gilligan and the Skipper deal with being unable to locate the parents of a boy , only to find that the child has run away from his parents to get away from their constant pressure on him to excel in athletics and in school. Meanwhile, Henry Elliot  is a workaholic whose wife  is trying to get him to relax and forget about work.
