Chromophobia comes from the Greek word "chroma", which translates as "color", and "phobos", which translates to "fear". The two form to create a portmanteau which it is assumed means "fear of color". Chromophobia takes a look at several people and relationships. Some of these people are very wealthy and have become so obsessed with their wealth and material objects they are very detached from more important things in life. The things they choose to reject in their pursuit for the finer things in life include friendship, their children, love, and integrity. At one point or another in the movie, each character begins to realize and then face their problems and in a sense their lives come crashing down. The characters then begin to see if they can get their lives back and carry on with a new look.
