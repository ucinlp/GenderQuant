Steve Case  has to deal with trouble at his tropical fruit company's Central American banana plantation. A revolutionary, Rosario La Mata , is stirring up unrest among the workers, and the only man who can handle the situation, foreman Nick Butler , has just quit. Steve manages to persuade Nick to stick around . Adding to the complications is Lee Donley , a woman whom Steve has ordered out of the region for causing a different kind of trouble among the men. The film borrowed plot elements from 'The Front Page' and 'Red Dust'. And ended with Cagney saying to Sheridan "You and that 14-carat oomph", a studio 'in-joke' in reference to Sheridan's title as the 'Oomph Girl'.
