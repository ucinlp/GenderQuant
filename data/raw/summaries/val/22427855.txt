Adam Raki  is a young man with Asperger syndrome living alone in Manhattan after his parents' deaths. He has a friend, Harlan Keyes , an old army buddy of his father's, who is always there for him. Because of his condition, Adam has difficulty communicating with others and likes to escape into his love of space exploration. His fixation on detail, repetitive behaviors, and mind-blindness cost him his job at a toy manufacturing company and nearly get him arrested after he is mistaken for a pedophile. He has been living in the apartment he and his father shared, and does not want to leave it, but the loss of his job leaves him with an uncertain future, including the problem of continuing to pay the mortgage. Beth Buchwald , a school teacher and aspiring children's book writer, moves into the apartment above his and they strike up an awkward friendship. One night, Beth is shocked to find him trying to clean her apartment windows suspended from the roof of the building in a spacesuit. Beth takes a liking to Adam despite his oddities. Adam hopes for a relationship, but the first attempts are uneasy due to his fear of social interaction. Eventually he breaks out of his mechanical routines enough to be able to date Beth. When he tries to ask Beth if she was aroused as he was by raccoons during an outing to Central Park, she is taken aback. Adam admits his Asperger's to her, explaining his inability to interpret her emotions. Surprised by his innocence, Beth understands the reason for his question and they continue dating. Eventually their relationship becomes intimate with Beth helping him understand how to better connect with her, how to introduce himself to her family, and how to interview for a new job. Things go downhill as Beth's father, Marty , gets into legal trouble. Adam naively asks him questions about the details of Marty's alleged crimes; this creates a rift with Beth, although they later make up. Marty pleads guilty and is about to be sentenced. Beth's mother  calls Adam trying to find Beth. She asks him to check Beth's calendar for any way to reach her. He finds that Beth had put down a reminder to meet her parents on the night they "unexpectedly" bumped into each other. Beth knew that Adam would be uncomfortable, so she and her father engineered an "accidental" meeting. When Beth confirms this, Adam angrily accuses her of being a liar and her father a criminal. Beth storms out and goes to her parents' home. Adam gets a call from the Mount Wilson Observatory in California offering a job there building microcircuits for satellite guidance and navigation systems. He is uncertain about leaving the home he has known for most of his life. Feeling guilty for the things he said to Beth, he sets out by any means of transportation to the Buchwalds' home in upstate New York, even on foot, to apologize to Beth. He asks her to go to California with him. Marty tries to convince Beth not to go with someone "not of this world." This leads to a heated argument with Beth, who tells her father that he has lied to her and the family about his crimes. Beth returns with Adam to New York City to prepare him to go to California, but she has second thoughts upon realizing that the only reason Adam wants her to accompany him is that he needs her to interpret the world for him. She decides to stay in New York. A year later, while working his dream job as an astronomer at the observatory and learning to be more social, Adam receives a package from Beth, containing her first children's book inspired by the early events of their relationship. He reads it as the twirling stars of the cosmos light up the Californian night sky.
