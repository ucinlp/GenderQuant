Chang-sik lives strictly by the freeloader's handbook, doing the rounds of free samples in department store food sections and sponging off of his older brother. Mi-young nurtures grandiose dreams of becoming a TV actress but has failed every audition because she just can't act. The two unemployed with similar schedules and living in the same neighborhood are bound to run into each other, and they do. One day, Chang-sik and Mi-young are walking around distractedly when they end up in a head-on collision. Chang-sik's coins spill out from his hands and scatter all over the ground. His precious coins! He chases after every single one but ends up 10 cents short. He viciously turns to the Mi-young but she refuses to give him 10 cents. They become sworn enemies after this incident, but then come across the chance of a lifetime. By chance, they witness a hit-and-run involving old man Hwang together. The next day, to their amazement, they see a banner advertising a 5 million won reward to eyewitnesses. Of course, each person eagerly offers to be a witness and ends up getting tangled up in something they hadn't bargained for¡¦ What have these two slackers gotten themselves into?
