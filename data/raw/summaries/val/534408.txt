The plot involves Steve Chase ([[James Ryan , trying to stop the evil Marduk from amassing an army of mind-controlled karate slaves and taking over the world. Steve is assisted by Gorilla, the strongman ; Gypsy Billy, the "former champion of the world", Norman Robinson; The Fly, the mystic , and Hotdog, the gimmicky weapon-expert and theoretical comic relief . Also on Steve's team is Kandy Kane , a woman claiming to be the daughter of Dr. Kane, who invented the potato-based mind-control serum that Marduk uses on his army. The movie is characterized by confusing dialogue and a plot that's largely taken from Bruce Lee films , although the martial arts scenes are considered by some to be surprisingly accurate  ignoring the constant backflips Steve Chase uses to get anywhere.
