The Abbate family lived a typical family story until the night of Monday February 13, 2006. Luke was on his way home from football practice when the teen driver decides to go over a hill and decides to hill hop and make the car go airborne. He sped up the car to about 90 miles an hour and the car landed in a ditch 70 feet below. Luke suffered severe head trauma and broken bones. All the teens in the car except Zack Barnett were hospitalized. The doctor declared Luke brain dead the next day, Tuesday February 14th 2006. When Mrs. Abbate told the family about taking Luke to the DMV to get his learner's permit 3 months ago, she said that he asked "What's organ donation?" She explained it to him, and he said "Yes I want to do that." The family made the very very difficult decision to donate his organs. 5 people received parts of Luke's body parts. Including a lady from New York. She received his heart. The family then starts the journey to grieve the loss of Luke. Each family member dealt with it in their own way. The father starts working a lot more and the mom goes into a depression. Jon's grief though was an emotional roller coaster. One day, however, his mom takes him to weight training to try to change his appearance and get back to life again. His real life weight trainer portrays himself in the movie, and he gives Jon the speech about "living for two." When he feels a little bit better, but still grieving, he decides to go ahead and play football again. Then he goes to talk to his football coach  about switching his jersey number 40 to number 5. The number Luke wore. Wake Forest University was expected to come in last in the 2006 season. But with Jon Abbate's help, they end up an unlikely champion, sharing the Atlantic Coast Conference Championship with Georgia Tech and ending the season ranked 18th in the AP poll. Finally, at the end of the movie, the lady who receives Luke's heart came to their house and Steven Abbate listened to it, and her little girl says "Are you Luke's Mommy?" And she says "Yes, yes I am." And Mr. Abbate says "Our Boy." The plot is based on a true story, set in and around the events of the Wake Forest football team's 2006 season. Luke Abbate's parents set up a foundation in his honor - which gives scholarships to deserving students from Luke's high school and helps families deal with issues around reckless teenage driving.
