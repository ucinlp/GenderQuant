As the world awaits the return of a crew of astronauts from a deep space mission, a young woman named Thelma Joyce appears on a television talk show to discuss caves. Soon after her interview begins, Thelma has a horrible psychic vision. After the spacecraft returns to Earth missing its occupants, a girl on a beach discovers a weird, blue, pulsating rock. Her mother soon finds her with her face ripped off. Thelma and her husband Roy meet up with their friends at a bowling alley. After a short gambling session, the group leaves to go explore a cave. The group stops at a roadside caf√© to buy food and change into their caving gear. Thelma's friend Burt discovers a blue rock that he decides to keep in his pack. The group can't figure out what type of rock it is. The group finally arrives at the cave, and quickly rapells to the bottom to set up camp for the night. Before falling asleep, Thelma tells Roy that she feels that something horrible is about to happen, but Roy calms her down. The next day, Thelma's friend Jill discovers the blue rock that Burt dropped while rapelling the previous day. Before Jill can touch it, the rock opens up and a creature attacks her face. Thelma senses what is happening and panics. Roy calms her down, then decides to go find Jill's body. Roy rapells down into a hole and finds Jill, alive and with her face intact. He straps her to a lifter and she is lifted up to the rest of the group. Jill is set aside by herself, still unconscious. While the group is taking pictures of the many rock formations, a creature erupts from Jill's face and attacks Burt's neck. Burt is dragged upside down as the creature slices his neck repeatidly until his head falls off. The creature quickly grows into a mature alien and slaughters the group one by one, multiplying with each kill. Thelma and Roy manage to outrun the Aliens and escape the caves. They get in their car and drive towards the city. On the way to the city, they discover a police car, but no police officers are in sight. They stop at the roadside cafe' again, only no one is there. Roy tries to call for help on a payphone, but no operator is available. They get back into the car and continue to drive to the city. Thelma and Roy finally get back to the city, but strangely, they can't find anyone. They stop at the bowling alley, only to find that it's empty, too. Roy goes to the back, only to be killed by an alien waiting there. The Alien chases Thelma through the bowling alley, until she hits it in the head and leaves. Thelma runs through the empty city streets, calling for help but getting no answer. She finally stops yelling and sits down in an intersection. Suddenly, text shoots at the screen, warning the audience "You may be next!", meaning that the aliens have taken over Earth.
