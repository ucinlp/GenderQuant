Saravanan, orphaned by his dead mother - a mental patient - is adopted by a childless couple . Theirs is an inter-caste marriage. At college, he runs into Kavitha , the granddaughter of caste-obsessed Sengodan. The triangle is completed by Aavudayappan alias Armstrong, a US-return who is smitten by Kavitha. With a little unintentional photo-swapping by the marriage broker, the parents of Saravanan and Aavudayappan  both think they have an alliance for their son with Sengodan's family and show up at Kavitha's house at the same time. Romance flowers between Saravanan and Kavitha, who assume they are going to wed, while Aavudayappan continues to dream of Kavitha. A series of contrivances allows this comedy of errors to carry on till the engagement where announcement of the groom's name causes all sorts of confusions. Sengodan is now against the Saravanan-Kavitha union since Saravanan's parents are of different castes. Things come to a dramatic conclusion when Sengodan realizes that Prasanth is indeed his own grandson, with a brief flashback relating the 'Nizhalgal' Ravi - Anju marriage split due to her illness. Film ends with prashanth and rambha marry each other.
