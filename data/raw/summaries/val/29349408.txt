However two descendants, Amy Whitlock  and Todd Lanier ([[David Weston , fall in love and plan to marry regardless of the families' objections. The Laniers, headed by Bill Lanier , are building developers who now own part of the old Whitlock Estate. Without their knowledge and following the instructions of Lanier manager Myles Forrester  a bulldozer overturns headstones and churns up graves in the old Whitlock Cemetery. At night, when all is quiet an exhumed grave opens and Vanessa Whitlock , the witch buried centuries ago, rises from the grave. Together with Morgan Whitlock , they use their witchcraft and one by one, the Laniers meet with various fatal accidents. Tracy Lanier  follows her future sister-in-law Amy into the family crypt only to see the risen Vanessa and her witches conducting black magic rites. Tracy is captured and while either in a trance or drugged tied up to be used as a human sacrifice. Looking for Tracy, Bill and Todd go to the Whitlock crypt. They find and rescue Tracy. Todd returns to the crypt for Amy, who has now joined the rest of her family and embraced Satanism. He is captured by the witches. Vanessa threatens Todd and reverting back to good, just in time to save her beloved, Amy pours burning oil over her ancient ancestor. The fire kills not only all the witches but Amy as well. Todd escapes and along with his surviving family stands and watches the Whitlock estate burn to the ground ending the 300-year-old nightmare.
