17-year-old Pete Riley works as the assistant manager at the local 26-screen grand megaplex, a job that he loves and spends the majority of his time at. Rumor has it that the megaplex is haunted by a "phantom", someone who was trapped inside the old movie theater that was demolished to build the current megaplex. Pete, senior manager Shawn MacGibbon, the other employees, and an old man known as "Movie Mason"  are working to prepare the theater for the star-studded premiere of the new Hollywood blockbuster "Midnight Mayhem". Wolfgang Nedermeyer, the owner of the megaplex, is to be among the guests. To Pete's disappointment, he is forced to bring along his younger siblings, 13-year-old Karen and 10-year-old Bryan, to the theater while their mother goes out on a date with her boyfriend George. Pete dumps his siblings in a movie so he can focus on setting up for the premiere, but problems begin to pop up all through the megaplex. The other movies begin to suffer mishaps, which Karen and Bryan realize are all related to the titles of the films being shown . Pete, Karen, and Bryan work together and discover that the rumored phantom is indeed behind these acts of sabotage. Through online spoilers, Bryan and Karen are able to learn the supposedly secret plot of "Midnight Mayhem", and Pete is able to stop the phantom from sabotaging the important premiere. The phantom is revealed to be Shawn, who Nedermeyer immediately fires. He offers Pete the job of senior manager at the megaplex, something Pete has always wanted. Though Pete tells Nedermeyer that he'd be honored, he turns down the job. Inspired by Karen and Bryan from their help exposing Shawn as the phantom, Pete realizes the importance of his childhood and doesn't want to waste it anymore, asking for the rest of the night off. George proposes to Julie, and the family then attends the movie premiere.
