David  seems to have everything. He is smart, talented, funny, and popular. He is best friends with Chris , a quirky outsider. He seems to have it all together, yet as his personal academic expectations and those of his parents become overwhelming, he seemingly is keeping emotional problems secret to himself. At a party with his school friends along the coast, he takes a walk to the edge of a cliff overlooking the ocean. Chris, playful as ever, decides to sneak up on his friend, but when he emerges from behind a rock, David is not there. He has fallen to his death. Originally assumed to be a horrible accident, the situation changes when Chris receives a suicide note in the mail. Chris and David's girlfriend, Lauren , want to hold some type of memorial, but a reluctant school decides against it, leaving the kids to memorialize their friend in their own way.
