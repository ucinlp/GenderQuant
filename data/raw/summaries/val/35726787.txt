Narayana Rao ([[Rajendra Prasad  is a patriotic and simple village school master, who takes immense pleasure in working for the betterment of his students and his village. The movie shows Narayana Rao returning from the USA to his native village after a long gap. While sentiments and affection used to be the guiding forces in the village he left, commercialism and greed are the dominant forces in the village he returns to. Stung by the changes his village has undergone and ashamed with the rapid decline in human values due to urbanization, Narayana Rao sets about repairing the damage time has caused. In between, flashback episodes show the life Narayana Rao used to lead in his village and the bonds shared between members of various communities. Will Narayana Rao be able to arrest the damage and bring about a realisation in people? That forms the story of Onamaalu.http://www.123telugu.com/reviews/review-onamaalu-noble-attempt.html
