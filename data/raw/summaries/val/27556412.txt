Set in Ewedown, a fictitious village in Dorset, England. Tamara Drewe, a young and attractive journalist, returns home with the intention of selling her now-deceased mother's house which she has inherited, and in which she grew up. Locals are amazed at the improvement in her appearance after she had a nose job while away. Andy had been interested in her when she was a girl, and when he sees her now it is clear he is attracted to her. Across the valley is a neighbour's house where authors stay to work on their stories, but the husband, Nicholas, a prolific crime novelist, keeps having affairs while his wife stays at home providing food and lodging for her patrons. At one point he embarks on an affair with Tamara, after she finishes with rock-band drummer Ben, whose dog Boss enjoys chasing cows. Andy has been asked by Tamara to work on the house so she can sell it, and he becomes aware of the affairs, as do two local schoolgirls  who cause some havoc by throwing eggs at cars and interfering with Tamara's emails. The teen Jody is infatuated with Ben, and when he leaves Ewedown after the Tamara affair, Jody uses her wiles to lure him back. Eventually her deceit is discovered and she receives a hard dose of reality. In a strange turn of events, Nicholas is killed in an accident. Beth, the jilted housewife running the writers' retreat, is befriended and then loved by one of her lodgers, and she easily persuades him to remain at the retreat with her. By this time the true love of Andy and Tamara brings them together, Tamara deciding to stay in Ewedown after all.
