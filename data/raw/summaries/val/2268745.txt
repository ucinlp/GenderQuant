Alex Gates  is a wealthy wine merchant who has distanced himself from his alcoholic wife Suzanne  with his philandering, and from his stepson Jason  with his indifference. Alex is heavily in debt, and cases the house of his clients, the Reese family. After he steals a valuable diamond necklace with the help of his Cuban mistress Gabriela  and his safe-cracker partner Victor , things start to fall apart fast. Suzanne sets out to interrupt what she thinks is another one of Alex's weekend dalliances down in the Florida Keys, but his trip is really to pawn the jewels. Trouble escalates when she discovers the truth and gets involved.
