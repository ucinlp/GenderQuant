Paul Clark and his children, Hilary and Bobby, are really down-hearted after the death of Jane, Paul's wife. After seventeen years of happy suburban marriage, Paul loses Jane to a heart attack, and is left alone to raise their two children. Paul also runs a couple of sporting-goods stores with his younger brother Charlie. Hilary needs advice on birth control, Bobby blames himself for his mother's having gone away, and Paul sleepwalks through his loss. This is until Mary Parker enters his life. A former tennis star who is now an agent and promoter of active athletes, something about Paul's courtliness attracts Mary, who never had time for childhood or marriage. She sends him Barry Bonds, the San Francisco Giants MVP outfielder, to sign baseballs at the sporting-goods store, and in return Paul sends her a pair of shoes. Soon they meet for coffee, listen to Mozart and have dinner, where they soon decide to live together.<ref namehttp://books.google.co.uk/books?idPA54&dqen&saxd_MT8yQJIPE0QWw3fTRAQ&vedonepage&q&fNew York Magazine - Google Books |publisher1994-01-03 |accessdatehttp://www.signis.net/malone/tiki-index.php?page7d20e63f1d3b98bdd9f0d0d603fb2b24 |titleSignis.net |date2012-06-04}}
