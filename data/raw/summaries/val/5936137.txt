This film follows the exploits of two rock stars Nick Cross and Christian, who are played by Scott Shaw and Kenneth H. Kim respectively. The Christian character recruits Nick Cross to reenter the world of Rock n' Roll but he is far too lost in his use of heroin to move forward with the project. This leads to the ongoing degeneration of the primary characters and their individual girlfriends until several members of the cast either die from the use of drugs or the gunplay generated by the Nick Cross character due to his anger at these deaths.
