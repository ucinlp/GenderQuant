On the eve of the Battle of El Alamein, Captain Tim Cotton leads a patrol on a raid to destroy a German fuel dump located deep behind enemy lines. Captain Williams of the Royal Engineers is posted to Cotton's patrol to deal with a minefield surrounding the German petrol dump. A regular soldier, Williams takes time to adjust to the non-regulation way the LRDG operates. After surviving a perilous journey, they arrive and destroy the stocks of petrol, only to find that the dump also contains a large number of tanks. With their radio smashed in a German ambush, they must return to base to report the information while there is time for it to be acted upon. During their return journey they are harassed by a German officer determined to prevent the LRDG making it back to base.
