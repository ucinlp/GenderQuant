Mickey and the Gang help cheer up Jimmy, a little sick boy, by giving him a puppy that they found. Unknown to the kids, the puppy actually belongs to Stinkie Davis. Stinkie and his father make the kids pay $10.00 in order to make up for the stolen puppy. The kids build a big grinding organ, with Mickey acting as the organ grinder, and Billy acting as the monkey. Later, the kids put on a minstrel show in a local talent contest.
