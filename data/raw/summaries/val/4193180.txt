Some years after his dangerous ride down the steep mountain to capture the Brumby herd and regain the Colt from old "Regret", Jim Craig , now with a large herd of mountain-bred horses of his own, returns to his home vicinity to take up with his girl, Jessica Harrison . She is still smitten with him, but opposition from her father  remains as resolute as ever. Further, she also has a rich would-be suitor endeavouring to court her, Alistair Patton , son of the banker from whom Harrison is seeking a large loan. Before he returns from Harrison's property to his home, Jim meets an army officer seeking quality horses for the remount service on a regular basis. As the young Patton realizes Jessica's affections remain for Jim, and that she doesn't "give a damn" about him , he jealously and maliciously recruits a gang to steal Jim's horses. Jim gives chase and in so doing again rides his horse down the steep mountainside. Patton shoots at him; the horse is killed and Jim is injured but manages to recover and resume the pursuit. As Jim had earlier let the wild stallion which led the brumbies loose into the wild again, in a twist of fate, the stallion shows itself from the wild at this crucial moment, and Jim finally trains this horse that has been the enigma of the entire district for decades. As he breaks him in and learns to ride him, they become friends, and together, they catch up to Patton and his gang. Jessica's father has also relented during this time, seen 'the light' and eventually joins with Jim and his 'rough-rider' friends to hunt down Patton and his gang. Jim Craig gets and wins his man-on-man duel with the chief 'villain', Allistair Patton, and Harrison gives his final approval for Jessica and Jim's alliance and the couple marry.
