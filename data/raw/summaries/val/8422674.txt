Lalita  catches the eye of JB  and he immediately falls in love with her and decides that he must have her. Her uncle Madhi arranges for them to marry but he is only doing this because JB is paying him to. When she refuses, JB kidnaps her and keeps her in his home until the day of the wedding. She is literally watched over by JB every day in case she tries to escape. On the day of the wedding, Lalita faints and uses this to escape. She also moves her mother away and barely escapes JB who assumes that she has been killed after he saw her being hit by a car. In fact, Lalita swapped her wedding dress with someone else, so the person that JB saw being hit by the car was not Lalita. Lalita escapes the city and meets Raj  who at first she uses him as a cover, but they both fall in love with each other. She uses the name Shikha instead. Raj's grandfather Rai Saheb  is happy that his grandson wants to marry Shikha and he arranges for a wedding. Unfortunately, JB finds out that Lalita is still alive through her mother and quickly traces her. He sees her at a fairground with Raj and is filled with anger. JB tells the whole family who Lalita really is with the help of her devious uncle. Lalita is taken away and is forced to be a dutiful wife, which in JB's terms means that she has to stay with him forever. After hiding and frustration, Lalita decides to take matters into her own hands... Finally, Lalita decides she has had enough and tries to kill JB but fails. At the end, Raj comes and rescues her.
