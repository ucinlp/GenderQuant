Shortly after Teresa  sets fire to her husband's hair, the antagonized and reserved businessman agrees to participate in his pretty young wife's personality games. Teresa soon fills their contemporary home with family heirlooms she retrieved from the basement, and a sense of isolation takes over the house as the couple lock the doors and draw the shades away from the prying eyes of neighbours. However, all too soon these games reach a feverish intensity and fantasy soon blurs into reality.Greenspun, Roger. "Honeycomb", pp. 51. The New York Times. 23 November 1972. Retrieved on 30 July 2011
