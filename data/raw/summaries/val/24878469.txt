Larry is abandoned by his wife and two children, who have moved to London since the split. He is introduced to Beth at a party of Martin  and Sidney , and an immediate attraction to each other ensues.

At the end of the night, he brings home Beth, and is welcomed by her children Cathy  and Petey . Even though Beth’s mother Neenie  criticizes him for having given up on his marriage with Jo too fast, Larry continues to meet with Beth.

Especially Robin blames her father for replacing Jo with Beth, and a planned wedding is shoved due to the continuing frictions. Sidney, Beth’s best friend, advises Beth to give Larry another chance, explaining how love is not always perfect by giving example of how Martin has committed adultery. Simultaneously, Larry dresses up as Cupid and convinces her to marry him. She quickly starts to worry about their future though, fearing that Larry will one day abandon her the way Peter did.
