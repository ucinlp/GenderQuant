Shaam and Sneha are cousins. Shaam gets a job in Chennai. He then comes to Chennai and instead of staying at Sneha's house he rents an apartment with his colleague Vivek. Sneha doesn't like this and refuses to come to Shaam's house until he visits her place. But they meet and catch up with each other now and then. Meanwhile Shaam meets another girl, Jaya Re, who plays pranks on people just for fun. During one such prank Shaam and Jaya end up becoming friends. They both work in rival Ad agency. While doing a project Shaam selects his cousin Sneha's photo  over Jaya's which makes her upset. But to reconcile their friendship Shaam sends Jaya's pics to Miss Chennai competition which she eventually wins. After a few days Shaam, Sneha and Jaya coincidentally meet in shopping place where Shaam ends up fighting with a person who misbehaved with Sneha. Sneha gets angry and walks away. Shaam drops of Jaya to her house where she proposes to Shaam, to which Shaam refuses. But he thanks her for making him realise that he is actually in love with his cousin, Sneha. Shaam apologises to Jaya. Sneha goes to attend her childhood friends marriage and when she comes back brings along her friend's brother and also her friend, Rajiv Krishna. Rajiv had proposed to a girl and when she rejected him he took to drinking. To make him forget his grief Sneha brings him to Chennai. Shaam first mistakes that Sneha is in love with Rajiv and when she clears off his misunderstanding, he immediately proposes to her. She rejects him. Over the days, Sneha and Shaam behave in a very normal and usual manner which confuses Shaam's friends. They confront him to which he replies that just because she doesn't love me, doesn't mean that I should snub her or treat her badly or take to drinking or some such means, that means that my love was never true. Love is not business or deal in which it is to be given only when you get it in return. Shaam friend, Jaya, who had earlier proposed to him joins his office and rebukes him, saying she doesn't talk to people who don't like her. One day she falsely complains to their boss about Shaam misbehaving with her, for which Shaam gets a firing from his boss. Shaam never behaves badly with Sneha or snubs her, in fact he goes out of his way to help. During one such incident when Sneha gets injured during a festival, Shaam carries her all the way to hospital and takes care of her. One evening Sneha calls Shaam saying that she and Rajiv had gone to the beach and he drank so much that now he is sick and puking all over. She asks Shaam to come and help her. Shaam comes to the beach, in spite of the fact that he has a very important meeting to attend. Meanwhile, Sneha calls again at Shaam's office, which is answered by Jaya and Sneha blurts out that Shaam is coming to help her and will not be able to attend the meeting. Jaya assures Sneha that Shaam need not go for the meeting, she will attend it herself. On hearing this, Shaam gets suspicious, which makes Sneha think over and apologises to him for talking to Jaya and revealing that Shaam is not going for the meeting. He says her not to worry, he will take care and also he brings Rajiv to his flat. The next morning, Shaam is sacked, since he did not attend the meeting which cost the company a very important project. Shaam goes to his Jaya's house and calmly explains her that she should not waste her life on harassing him and should instead should find peace within. Rajiv, Shaam and Sneha set off to attend Rajiv's lover's marriage. While on the train, Rajiv commits suicide. Shaam does not attend his funeral. When Sneha questions him, Shaam replies by saying that Rajiv took a wrong step and he doesn't like such people. Sneha realises that Shaam is a very good guy. In spite of she rejecting him, he has always helped her and is still in love with her. She falls for him. Shaam is stabbed by some goons with whom he fought earlier. He is hospitalised. But at the same time Sneha's parents are arranging her marriage. Sneha explains to her father about Shaam and his nature. Just then she gets a call from the hospital. Sneha rushes to the hospital where the doctor  informs her that Shaam will be treated for his stab wounds, but he cannot be treated for his cancer, which is in the last stage. Sneha cries over his sick bed, finally accepting his proposal. To this Shaam smiles mischievously and the doctor reveals that he does not have cancer, they just played a prank to tease her. Shaam and Sneha hug each other.
