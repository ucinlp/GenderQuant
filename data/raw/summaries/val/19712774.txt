= The film is set in contemporary times with Dante being counseled by Fr. Jacob inside of a mental hospital. Dante keeps having nightmares about the murder of his wife and events related to it. Father Jacob is interested in Dante mainly because of the symbol that keeps recurring in his nightmares. The Roman Catholic Church sent Fr. Markus to the mental institution to pull some strings to get Dante an early review by the hospital board; and to get Dante released under the custody of Fr. Jacob because the Church had some knowledge of the meaning behind the dream symbol. With Dante now released under the care of Fr. Jacob, Dante's dreams turn into real-time visions that lead them into encounters with angels and demons; and directly into thwarting Azazel's plan to release Beshwa from the Abyss and thereby allowing Lucifer into the world.
