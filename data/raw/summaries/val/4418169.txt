When the babies were watching a science fiction oriented movie about a time-traveling machine, Angelica shows them her new "tapiyokie"  machine. She forbids the babies to play with it, but, as with many of her toys, they do. Angelica is angry and chases the babies into a closet, with Angelica on the outside. Angelica starts counting to ten for them to come out, and Tommy suggests they go to "the foocher"  so that they will be grown up enough for Angelica not to boss them about any more. Angelica says multiple random numbers in incorrect order before reaching 10, so this gives the babies enough time to rig the karaoke machine into a time-travel device. At the exact moment Angelica reaches ten, Tommy pushes a button and there is a swirling orange vortex and the babies see themselves in the future. Coincidentally, they are now ten years older. The group stumbles out of the closet and teenage Angelica demands her Emica CD back . They want the CD to learn each song in hopes that Emica will call one of them up to sing with her. In the beginning of this part of the episode, nine-year-old Dil is shown to have an unusual personality, and Angelica states that Phil and Lil dropped him on his head when he was a baby. Stu says that he has a disco dance on the same day that the group has their concert. Stu also states that he will wear his lucky zodiac necklace, one similar to Emica's. When the group leaves for school called Jim's Jr. High, Tommy's grandfather Lou is now a bus driver. Angelica's friend, Samantha Shane , tells Angelica that she is going to the Emica concert. Angelica lies that despite having the same last name, she and Tommy aren't related. She also says that she is going to wear the zodiac necklace that Emica  wears. She needs Tommy to steal his father's necklace so she will look like she told the truth to her friend. She says that if he does so, she will introduce Samantha to Chuckie. Tommy makes a fake necklace . Unexpectedly, Spike eats the decoy overnight and Stu finds out the next morning, and Tommy takes the blame for stealing it. Tommy is grounded and is going to miss the concert, and Angelica refuses to introduce Chuckie to Samantha. The group is sitting in their old sandbox, feeling gloomy that their friend is going to miss the concert. Stu and Didi hire Susie to babysit Tommy while they are at the dance, as she was not able to attend the Emica concert. Lil finds the necklace in the sandbox, and they need to return the necklace to Stu. Tommy is reluctant to do so, because he mustn't leave the house. Dil encourages Tommy to do otherwise. Susie  catches them as they leave the house, stating that she knows when they are always up to something. She then goes with the gang to return the necklace. On the way, they ride their bikes by the concert, where Angelica runs to towards them to get the necklace. Angelica admits to Samantha that the necklace belonged to Tommy's dad and also reveals that she and Tommy are cousins. As a way to try to make up, she introduces Samantha to Chuckie as "Charlie Finster, the III". Samantha shares her experiences with braces to "Charlie", as he is wearing them also, and the two are smitten with each other. As one more act of kindness, Angelica gives her ticket to Susie. They return Stu's necklace in the middle of his performance, and Stu can dance. They are now at the concert. Tommy  and Angelica's grandfather arrives with two tickets. One was intended for his wife, but gives it to Angelica because she was not there. In the stadium, Emica starts to sing. She calls Tommy up to sing, but Angelica begs to be up too, and Emica agrees. After a short-lived period of getting along with singing , Angelica and Tommy start to fight over the microphone. They struggle to what seems as backstage but travel back into the closet where the episode first began. Angelica yells at them, saying that they have to stay away from her items for the next "bazillion" years. They are now babies again and they are glad that Angelica will be nicer to them in ten more years, but he spoke too soon. Angelica finds Dil's drool over her player, and chases the babies for the rest of the episode screaming "AUNT DIDI!" Chuckie asks Tommy if ten years will take a long time. The episode ends shortly afterward, and Angelica's scream of "AUNT DIDI!" are heard again as this happens.
