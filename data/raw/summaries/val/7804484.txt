Paradesi tells the story of Valiyakaththu Moosa, an Indian Muslim who moves from the Malabar region of Kerala, India to Karachi, Pakistan during the British Raj in search of a job. Post-partition, he returns from Pakistan and settles down in Malappuram, Kerala. This man, who lives as a true Indian, doesn't get his Indian passport and thus an Indian identity in the official sense, even after 50 years of Independence. The police harass him and his neighbours in a similar situation as Pakistani spies. The film has Mohanlal playing the character in three stages of his life, between the ages of 35 and 80. Jagathy Sreekumar and Sidhique play his friends in the film. Swetha Menon plays his wife and Padmapriya acts as a journalist.
