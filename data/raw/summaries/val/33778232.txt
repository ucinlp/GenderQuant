One morning at Pink's house, Pink is sleeping. His alarm clock goes off at 07:00 AM. Pink thinks the sound is the telephone, so he picks it up. Nobody is answering, so he puts it back. Again the alarm clock goes off at 07:00 AM. Pink picks up and puts down the telephone. On a third try, the alarm clock goes off again at 07:01 AM. So Pink grabs the telephone and snaps the plug in half. He realizes that the alarm clock is ringing. So he turns it off. Later, Pink sees a man selling toy ducks. One of the ducks wanders away and goes near Pink while he's standing at a block. Pink suddenly sees the duck on the street. Pink saves the duck from being run over by a motorcycle. Pink then traps the duck inside a can. The can starts to move, making Pink flee from it. Then he runs past the other block  It turns out that Pink is hiding in a trash can. Back at Pink's house, Pink puts the duck in a box and sends it to Japan. As the seasons go by, Pink is looking out the window. It is raining. The scene then cuts to Winter, then to Summer. A few months later Pink receives a package with the same clockwork duck that he sent to Japan. Pink next takes the duck for a walk outside. Suddenly Pink sees a mother duck and her three ducklings, and the duck joins them. Pink is sad again. On another rainy day, Pink is again looking out the window, Autumn passes, Winter passes but in Spring, Pink comes to the door and is happy to see the duck. Pink realizes that the duck has been to Italy, Paris, and Japan. The duck invites 6 other ducks friends of him from around the world to Pink's house to play.
