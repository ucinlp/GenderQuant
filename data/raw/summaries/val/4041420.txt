Peter P. Peters , an American ballet dancer billed as 'Petrov' dances for a ballet company in Paris owned by the bumbling Jeffrey Baird . Peters secretly wants to blend classical ballet with modern jazz dancing, and when he sees a photo of famous tapdancer Linda Keene , he falls in love with her. He contrives to meet her, but she's less than impressed. They meet again on a liner travelling back to New York, and Linda warms to Petrov. Unknown to them, a plot is launched as a publicity stunt 'proving' that they're actually married. Outraged, Linda becomes engaged to the bumbling Jim Montgomery, much to the chagrin of both Peter and Arthur Miller, her manager, who secretly launches more fake publicity. Peters and Keene, unable to scotch the rumour, decide to actually marry and immediately divorce. Linda soon begins to fall in love with her husband, but it evaporates when she discovers him with another woman, and she leaves before he can explain. But when he does, with a new show accompanied by girls masked with her face, she happily joins him on the stage.
