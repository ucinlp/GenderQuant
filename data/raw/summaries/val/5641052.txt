In 1854, Major Geoffrey Vickers  and his brother, Captain Perry Vickers , are stationed at the fictional city of Chukoti in India, with the 27th Lancers of the British Army during the period of East India Company dominance over the Indian subcontinent. Perry has secretly betrayed Geoffrey by stealing the love of his fiancee Elsa . During an official visit to local tributary rajah, Surat Khan , Geoffrey saves the rajah's life. Later, Surat Khan massacres the inhabitants of Chukoti , and allies himself with the Russians, whom the British are fighting in the Crimean War. He spares Elsa and Geoffrey as they flee the slaughter to repay his debt to Geoffrey. The love triangle and the quest for vengeance are both resolved at the Battle of Balaclava. Aware that Surat Khan is inspecting the Russian position opposite the 27th Lancers, Geoffrey Vickers secretly replaces the written orders of Sir Charles Macefield  to the commander of the Light Brigade, Sir Benjamin Warrenton . Vickers orders the famous suicidal attack so the lancers can avenge the Chukoti massacre. He writes a note to Macefield explaining his actions and forces his brother to deliver it, sparing him from almost certain death. Just as in real life, the attack succeeds in reaching the Russian artillery positions. There, Vickers finds and kills Surat Khan, at the cost of his own life. After receiving Vickers' note, Macefield takes responsibility for the charge and burns the note to protect Vickers' good name.
