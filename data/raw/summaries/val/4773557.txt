Car thief Dick Kanipsia gets a parole from a penitentiary. He intends to go straight, but first he goes directly to see an old friend, Harry Moss, only to be shocked to see Harry get shot. Harry's dying words tell Dick to go find Barry Fenaka, a guy who supposedly knows where to find a stash of stolen cash that Harry has hidden. Dick picks up a hitch-hiker along the way, Kitty Kopetzky, who starts out as a friendly free spirit, then turns into a nut case who robs a diner where she and Dick go to eat. Fenaka turns out to be a small-time bandleader. He and his wife take Dick and Kitty along as passengers in their recreational vehicle on their way to retrieve Harry's money. But a mysterious black van is following them every foot of the way, resulting in a big surprise for all concerned.
