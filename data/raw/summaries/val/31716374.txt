Captain Steve Bannerman  has been asked to fly one last passenger flight from Hawaii to Australia for Trans-Pacific Airline. During a violent electrical storm, he crashes the jet airliner on an uninhabited South Pacific island. Bannerman takes charge of the survivors and teams with Merle Barnaby , a black marine returning from combat duty in Vietnam, to try to find a way to survive on the island. Among the surviving passengers and crew, they have the support of Gina Talbot  and Beejay Caldwell  but oil magnate Glenn Walkup , nightclub entertainer Eddie Randolph  and Jonesy  begin to cause trouble. In the midst of a power struggle, the captain has to contend with not only helping his crew and passengers survive but also dealing with a number of desperate and irrational passengers. Complicating matters is a 10-year-old boy suffering from acute appendicitis and a pregnant woman. When Bannerman rejects Walkup's idea of setting out in a raft as unsafe, he is brutally beaten. The raft sets out manned by Randolph and two associates, but to no avail. A radio bulletin announces the cancellation of all rescue attempts as Beejay falls from a cliff, attempting to escape Jonesy. Her panic-stricken assailant shoots Barnaby, accusing him of Beejay's murder. Jonesy is exposed when Beejay revives and tries to escapes into the jungle, but is accidentally impaled by Barnaby's animal trap. When a child is born, the survivors unite to create a new society.
