Pink runs an intergalactic gas filling station. He gives a robot who gives him a credit card, a free lollipop. An intergalactic space man (The Little Man flies to the station. The panther closes the station, making the space man so mad that he sends another robot to take off the bolts and screws to open the station. It doesn't work, and the space man throws his helmet off in anger. Then he sends another robot to catch a key, which the panther has. The space man is flying a jet-pack through space. Pink takes the jetpack off his back, hiding in a cloud, sending the space man plummeting into a flower, is spat out, and Pink is chased by the villain. He goes into a molecular disassembler/re-assembler machine. He teleports to another one, with the space man doing the same thing. The panther throws a flower into the molecular disassembler/re-assembler machine, making the space man half space man, half flower. He is chased by a Bee, and Pink Panther goes into the device once more. A bee flies in, making the panther half panther, half bee.
