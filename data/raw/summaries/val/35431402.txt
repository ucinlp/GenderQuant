Shiva intends to impress Parvathi with the devotion Arjuna has towards him. Just as Shiva disguised as Kiratha, a tribal hunter, appears before Arjuna, he sees a wild boar charging towards Arjuna and shoots an arrow at the boar. Arjuna, an accomplished archer, also shoots an arrow at the boar. The boar that was in fact a demon named Mookasura in disguise is killed and its original form revealed. However, a dispute arises between Arjuna and Kiratha as to who the real killer of the animal is. A long-drawn battle ensues between the two, resulting in Kiratha's victory over Arjuna. The vanquished Arjuna, unable to even stand up, makes a Shiva Linga out of mud and performs a puja, offering flowers. To his surprise, he finds that the flower he offers to the Linga is falling over the head of Kiratha. Arjuna then realises that Kiratha is none other than Lord Shiva. Pleased with his devotion, Lord Shiva grants the Pasupathastra, the divine arrow, to Arjuna.
