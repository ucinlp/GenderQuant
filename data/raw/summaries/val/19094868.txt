An alien artifact, identified as a possible "second Marker", is discovered on the planet Aegis VII. The Church of Unitology uses its influence to send the mining ship USG Ishimura to retrieve this holy relic. While the ship approaches, they receive radio reports of an outbreak of violent behaviour among the colonists. The Marker is brought aboard by order of Captain Mathius . Head of Security Alissa Vincent  asks to investigate the colony, but Mathius believes that nothing is amiss. While the Ishimura extracts a chunk of the planet to mine, a man in the ship's sickbay struggles against his restraints and resists sedation, begging to be killed. Meanwhile, two miners on Aegis VII check an outpost that has gone silent. One man vanishes during a blackout, while the other, Colin Barrow, sees his wife Jen  commit suicide before his eyes. Barrow takes her body and flees the facility in a shuttle, unaware of an alien presence attaching itself to the corpse. The Ishimura re-establishes links with the colony, receiving evidence of a bloody massacre and warnings of killers. The Captain refuses to radio for help, as he would face a court martial for entering a restricted system - He instead orders that the planet be quarantined. Before he can be shut out, Barrow's shuttle crashes into the Ishimuras hangar, just as he is killed by his mutated wife. The security team is dispatched to arrest and quarantine, but they find nothing aboard the small ship. The man in sickbay awakens to discover alien creatures mutating the corpses in the morgue, which then kill him. Tensions flare as Unitologist crewmembers demand to see the Marker; they are quickly calmed and dispersed by engineer Samuel Irons , a Unitologist himself. The security team fight the infestation as it spreads through the ship, with Irons joining them after meeting in the canteen. Dr. Terrence Kyne  tells Mathius that the Marker is responsible for the colonists going insane and must not be taken to Earth, but the now deranged Captain claims persecution and mutiny. Mathius is accidentally killed by Kyne, who flees the bridge. The ship itself turns against the crew when the escape pods are inexplicably launched empty and their communications systems destroyed, leaving any chance of rescue non-existent. On the way to the bridge, Vincent's teammate Hanson ([[Phil Morris  goes insane and kills teammate Shen , then is in turn killed by Ramirez . Vincent, Irons, and Ramirez return to the bridge where they learn that the ship is almost entirely overrun; they then discover that Kyne is sabotaging the ship's engines, to scuttle the ship on the planet below. On their way to confront Kyne, the team finds survivors  trapped by Necromorphs. Irons buys time for Vincent and Ramirez to extract the scared crew members by using himself as bait, and is eventually killed. Ramirez then sacrifices himself getting Vincent into the control room - She confronts Kyne, who claims that his actions are necessary to stop the alien outbreak leaving the system. Vincent fails to restore the engines, and Kyne escapes with her weapon. Vincent finds herself surrounded by Necromorphs, but learns that the creatures cannot come into close proximity with the artifact, which kept them imprisoned on Aegis VII. Spurred on by a vision of Ramirez's ghost, Vincent leaves a video log that details the entire sequence of events, adding that the Marker and the Ishimura must be destroyed. She uploads the video log to a distress beacon, opens the airlock and launches the beacon from the downed shuttle. Vincent and the Necromorphs are sucked out into space. Vincent's body drifts in space as the song Twinkle Twinkle Little Star plays. The story ends as the USG Kellion arrives and prepares to dock on the Ishimura - the beginning of Dead Space.
