While staying at Govindan Kutty's house, they are greeted with flowers left at the doorstep with a tag reading "Maya." Immediately thinking that this is their old Maya, they go to meet her.

Later, "Maya" comes and gets them out of jail saying that they are her friends and didn't recognize it because she hadn't seen them in a long time. Once out, she says not to bother her anymore because of this. Maya lives right across from Govindan Kutty's house.
