{{Plot}} Two years after the Westworld tragedy in the Delos amusement park, the corporate owners have reopened the park following $1.5 billion in safety and other improvements. For publicity purposes, newspaper reporter Chuck Browning and TV reporter Tracy Ballard are invited to review the park. Just before the junket is announced, Browning arranges to meet with a Delos employee who promises he has dirt on the corporation. At the meeting, the tipster is shot in the back and dies with an envelope in his hands. At the resort, guests can choose from a range of themed parks: Medievalworld, Romanworld, and Futureworld . Browning and Ballard choose to visit Futureworld, which simulates a trip to an orbiting space station. Robots are available for sexual exploits as well as amusements like a boxing game, where the humans control robot boxers. They are guided through the resort by Dr. Duffy. Duffy graciously shows them the marvels of Delos, demonstrating that all the problems of Westworld have been fixed. The reporters are stunned to find that the control center, overseen by Dr. Schneider, is staffed entirely by robots. This revelation confirms Browning's suspicion that something is wrong at the resort. That night, their dinners are drugged. While they sleep, exhaustive tests are run that will enable Delos to make clone duplicates of the reporters. In addition to Browning and Ballard, a senior Russian general and a Japanese politician are also singled out for cloning. After they are returned to their rooms at 2:30 a.m., Ballard awakes in a fright, thinking all the medical tests were a nightmare. She and Browning sneak out to explore the resort's underground mechanical areas. They end up triggering a cloning machine which generates three deadly samurai. Just as they are about to be captured by the samurai, a mechanic named Harry  saves them. He takes them back to his quarters, which he shares with a faceless robot he's named "Clark" . It is stated that Clark is the body of one of the pleasure bots from the original version of Romanworld. The reporters interview Harry about Delos, but Schneider interrupts them and insists that they return to their rooms. The following day, while Ballard is testing out a dream recording device that Delos has designed, Browning slips out to see Harry. Harry takes Browning to a locked door that he has never been able to enter, although another technician - a robot - routinely enters. Realizing the key is in the robot's eyes, Harry destroys the robot and steals its face. They return with Ballard and open the door. Inside, they see the clones of themselves as well as the Russian and Japanese leaders. The clones are fully functional and are in the process of being coded through subliminal messages; they are instructed to always work for the good of Delos and to destroy their originals. Browning explains that his tipster's envelope was filled with clippings about establishment figures from around the world, realizing that Delos must be cloning the rich and powerful. The trio decides to flee the resort on the next plane. Browning and Ballard return to their apartment where Duffy is waiting for them, who explains that by cloning world leaders they can ensure that laws are not passed which are harmful to Delos' interests. By cloning the two reporters, they would ensure favorable coverage which would help people forget the Westworld tragedy and popularize the new resort. Duffy also reveals that he believes that humans will destroy the planet if left to run it themselves. In the ensuing struggle, Duffy easily overpowers Browning with an unnatural strength. Ballard manages to shoot him twice. To confirm his suspicions, Browning peels back Duffy's face to reveal that he is a robot. As Harry makes his way through the tunnels to meet up with the reporters, he runs into Browning's clone, who kills him. Ballard and Browning are then beset by their own duplicates, who separate them and chase them through the facility, all the while taunting them with details about their lives . Eventually, one of each pair is killed in the two-fold struggle, though which one is left unclear. When the surviving Browning and Ballard meet, he seizes her and kisses her. In the end, Browning and Ballard are leaving the resort with the other guests. Schneider stops them on their way out to make sure they are the clones. The reporters confirm that they will be generating positive press for Delos, but just as they reach the exit, Ballard's badly beaten doppelg√§nger stumbles towards him, and Schneider realizes too late that he has been fooled. On the jetway, Browning tells Ballard that his editor is running the expose on Delos and the whole world will know what they are up to, and that kissing her was his idea to figure out whether or not she was a duplicate.
