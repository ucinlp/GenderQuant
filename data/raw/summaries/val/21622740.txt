Leading a lazy life, Fumiya has been a student for 8 years and owes money to loan sharks. One day, a man named Fukuhara comes to collect the loan, which Fumiya cannot pay. So Fukuhara makes a proposition: He will cancel the debt as long as Fumiya agrees to walk with him across Tokyo to the police station of Kasumigaseki, where he intends to turn himself for a crime he deeply regrets. Not having much choice, Fumiya accepts the deal. Thus begins their journey. Based on the original novel by the 125th Naoki Prize winner Yoshinaga Fujita.Announced July 18th 2001 Japan Weekly Monitor, Kyodo News International, Tokyo, Japan July 23rd 2001
