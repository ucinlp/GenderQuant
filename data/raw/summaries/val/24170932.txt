According to the film, the Americans came to the Philippines for one reason: to civilize the people. William McKinley's Benevolent assimilation was, he said, a way to educate and civilize their "little brown brothers", the Filipinos, and leave the country once it is ready to handle its own government. The movie shows that the arrival of the Americans was intended to be peaceful, however, under many circumstances, it became savage and barbaric.
