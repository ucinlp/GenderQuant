An older man, Andrew Marsh, is seen viewing a homemade pornographic tape. It is later revealed the man died from complications stemming from erotic asphyxiation. The main suspect is the woman having sex with Marsh in the film, Rebecca Carlson ([[Madonna , who after being charged with murder is represented by lawyer Frank Dulaney . The trial begins in Portland, Oregon and it isn't long before Carlson and Dulaney enter a sadomasochistic sexual relationship behind the back of Dulaney's unsuspecting wife . During their first sexual encounter, Dulaney, overcome by lust, notices too late that Carlson is tying his arms behind his back using his own belt. Carlson then pushes him onto the bed, removes his underwear, and while he is restrained, she humiliates him by pouring hot candle wax on his chest, stomach, and genitals, apparently amused by Dulaney's increasingly desperate reactions. The two then have sex with Carlson in complete control, an obvious counterpoint to their relationship in the courtoom, where Dulaney is the one in control. Carlson proclaims her innocence to Dulaney in private as well as in court, but district attorney Robert Garrett  is out to prove that Carlson deliberately killed Marsh in bed to receive the $8 million dollars he left her in his will. The testimony of Marsh's private secretary, Joanne Braslow , reveals that he also had a sexual relationship with her that could have contributed to his death, casting a reasonable doubt as to Carlson's guilt. Dulaney can't resist Carlson sexually but doesn't trust her. His wife sees telltale marks on his flesh and realizes he's been having an affair. Carlson is shown in court to have had previous sexual relationships with a number of older rich men, including Jeffery Roston , in which her lovemaking was just as rough, indicating that what she did with Marsh was not unusual. Carlson's testimony convinces the jury, which acquits her. Before leaving court, she mockingly thanks her attorney for getting a guilty client off, fully aware that he cannot repeat what she said and that she cannot be tried twice for the same crime. Dulaney goes that night to Carlson's home, where he finds her with Marsh's doctor, Alan Payley , freely discussing the way they conspired to kill Marsh. She's free and clear, but taunts Payley by telling him to lie low  and to leave because "I've already forgotten you." Carlson bluntly tells Dulaney that her sexual prowess is how she is able to make men do anything. An enraged Payley lashes out at Carlson physically and, after Dulaney pulls him off, Payley shoots her twice. She plunges from a window to her death.
