Whilst Mother  tries to make a meagre living writing stories and poems she hopes magazines and newspapers will publish, the children seek amusement by watching the trains on the nearby railway line  and waving to the passengers. They become friendly with Perks, the cheerful station porter, but feel the wrath of the Stationmaster when Peter is caught trying to steal coal to heat the house. They become friends with the Old Gentleman  who regularly takes the 9:15 down train. They ask him to assist them with food and medicine when Mother falls ill. He is happy to do so, although Mother is angry and embarrassed.

A friendship and possible future romance between Jim and Bobbie is hinted at. The area of England to which the family move is not specified, but the railway scenes were filmed on the Bluebell Line.
