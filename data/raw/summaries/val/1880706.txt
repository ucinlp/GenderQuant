To get his money, Porter is forced to deal not only with Resnick but with a lowlife named Stegman , with crime bosses from the Outfit, with the Chinese triads and with corrupt police detectives Hicks and Leary (Bill Duke and [[Jack Conley . He first finds Val and kills him with a revolver in Rosie's apartment. He then kills three of the Outfit's hit squad henchmen, including leader, Philip ([[John Glover , who have been sent by Outfit boss, Carter  to "Stitch this mutt up." Following several unsuccessful attempts to reclaim his $70,000, Porter shoots Carter. With the aid of Rosie, he kidnaps Johnny, the son of Bronson , the Outfit's head, and arranges for Hicks and Leary to be busted by their own colleagues in Internal Affairs by planting Leary's finger prints on the gun Porter used to kill Resnick, pick pocketing Hick's badge, then leaving both in the vicinity of Resnick's dead body. The mob's top figures, Bronson and Fairfax , join the hunt to take him down. Porter is captured by the Outfit after a wild chain of events involving the triads. After being tortured by having his toes smashed with a hammer, Porter lures Bronson and his men to an apartment that had previously been rigged by the Outfit's men to a phone connected to plastic explosive. After they meet an explosive demise, Porter and Rosie  drive off to Canada to begin a new life.
