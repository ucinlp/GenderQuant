Trudy is the girl of Ryan's dreams, but Trudy is waiting for God to tell her who she should marry; Ryan is not what she had in mind. When Ryan's friends discover this they create a plan behind Ryan's back to convince Trudy that God has chosen her to be with Ryan. With less than brilliant ideas, each plan backfires and each scheme gets more ridiculous. As his friends Jack, Lon, and Bridgett dig themselves deeper into trouble, they try to rationalize and justify each scheme to convince Trudy.
