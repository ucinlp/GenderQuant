Mike  is observing his two sons fighting; with one insisting that a promise doesn't mean anything. To make them understand that a promise does mean something, he tells them the story of his youth. Young Mike , his little brother Bobby , their mother Mary  and their German Shepherd Shane move to a new town after their father/husband leaves them. There, Mary marries a new man named Jack , who likes the others to call him "The King". Unbeknowst to Mary, the King is an alcoholic who often gets drunk and beats Bobby. The two boys, seeing that their mother has found happiness at last with the King, are reluctant to tell either her or the police about the abuse. They instead try to avoid the King by exploring and having adventures in amidst the local environs. In the process, the two concoct a plan for Bobby to escape the King once and for all. Inspired by the urban legend of a boy named Fisher who attempted to fly away on his bicycle, the two convert their epononymous Radio Flyer toy wagon into an airplane. With it, Bobby flies away. Though Mike never sees him again, he continues to receive postcards from him from places all over the world.
