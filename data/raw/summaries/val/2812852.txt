In Chicago, Darius Lovehall  is a poet who is giving a reading at the Sanctuary, an upscale nightclub presenting jazz and poetry to a bohemian clientele. Shortly before his set, he meets Nina Mosley , a gifted photographer who recently lost her job. They exchange small talk, and Darius makes his interest clear when he retitles his love poem "A Blues For Nina". A mutual attraction is sparked between them, and Darius invites himself back to her place to persistently ask her out. They have sex on the first date, but neither Darius or Nina are sure where to go next after this promising start. Nina has just gotten out of a relationship and isn't sure if she still cares for her old boyfriend or not, while at the same time Darius' friends read him the riot act for wanting to give up his freedom so early on in the game. From then on, their relation and everything else change for both of them.
