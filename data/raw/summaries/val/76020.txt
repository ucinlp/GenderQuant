A newspaper shows Porky traveling to Africa to hunt the rare do-do bird, worth four trillion dollars. Porky uses his airplane to go to Dark Africa, then Darker Africa, and finally lands in Darkest Africa. When Porky lands, a sign tells him that he's in Wackyland , while a voice booms out "It can happen here!" Porky tiptoes along the ground in his airplane and he is greeted by a roaring beast, who suddenly becomes effeminate and dances away into the forest. He watches as  the sun is lifted above the horizon by a tower of stacked creatures. Nearby, another creature rises out of a tall flower, playing "The William Tell Overture", using his nose as a flute. The creature launches into a wild drum solo, which brings out many strange, weird, and oafish creatures, including a rabbit dangling in midair from a swing that seems to be threaded through its own ears, and an angry criminal imprisoned behind a free-floating barred window that he holds in his hands. As Porky tries to find the do-do, he is distracted by a duck singing "Mammy!", a horn-headed creature, and a conjoined cat and dog hybrid creature spinning around like a tornado. Finally, the do-do appears. Porky tries to catch it, but it plays tricks on him. The do-do pulls out a pencil and draws a door in mid-air, and instead of opening it and running through, reaches down and lifts up the bottom edge of the door like a curtain, darts underneath and lets it snap back into place for Porky to bump into. At another point, the do-do appears on the Warner Brothers shield logo and slingshots Porky into the ground. Porky is defeated when the do-do pulls a wall of bricks in the picture and lets him crash into it. At the end of the film, Porky triumphs when he disguises himself as a bearded paperboy, shouting "Extra! Extra! Porky captures do-do!", before hitting the bird with a mallet. Porky loudly proclaims that he has captured the last do-do. The do-do mockingly replies, "Yes, I'm really the last of the do-dos. Ain't I, fellas?". A multitude of do-dos appear, all agreeing. They howl, which allows the do-do to escape and stand on Porky's head.
