Abraham Van Helsing battles with Simon Magus , defeating him using the Scepter of God. In the present day, students are digging for bones of animals at an excavation site. One student unearths a bone, slowly touches it, and it engulfs his hand. Simon Magus returns to life and terrorizes the excavation site. The scene then shifts to Michael Harris  and his best friend Danny Morgan  at school. After causing an explosion in chemistry class, they return to Michael's house. During a band rehearal, Danny sees an old trunk that looks to have been shipped all around the world. A Professor Arad shows up at Michael's house and explains that he is the great great grandson of Abraham Van Helsing and that he needs to take over the family business in order to save the world. The professor shows Michael all of the weapons that were locked in the family trunk. The professor claims that the only thing that can kill Simon Magus is the Scepter of God, which has now gone missing. Without it, Magus will terrorize the Earth and destroy all of mankind. Suddenly Magus bursts through the wall of the room, causing Michael and the gang to flee. They all go on the run as Magus gives chase, eventually revealing that Danny had buried the Scepter of God under a tree in his youth. The gang tracks down the tree, fights Magus, and eventually destroys him. Back at the school, Michael and Danny's band play at the sweetheart dance, where Octavio  danced like a "bad ass" and did not look at the camera. At the dance, the band proclaimed their band's name to be "The Van Helsings".
