Gopal Sivaji Ganesan and Gowri K. R. Vijaya are salespeople in competing organisations. They are professional rivals and end up sharing rooms in the same house belonging to an English. Naidu M. R. Radha and his Kannada wife Manorama are caretakers of the house where Mohan and Gowri stay. Gopal and Gowri get married and both quit their jobs on the same day. Naidu and his wife lend them some money to start a business. Gopal's business becomes successful and Gowri and Mohan have a son and are about to have another baby. A Punjabi family led by Baldev Singh  move into one of the portions. A Malayalee Muslim led by Ibrahim  family take up residence in other part of the same house. After some initial hiccups, the four families settle down and become close friends. Gopal's secretary Kamala tries to vamp him and her brother takes a photo of the two of them together and begins to blackmail Gopal. His neighbours help him fight off the blackmailer and this seals the bond between them even more strongly. When the house owner decides to sell the house and return to England, the families buy the house together with Gopal paying Naidu's share. They call the house Bharatha Vilas, since it houses people from all parts of the country. The movie catches up with the residents of Bharatha Vilas after many years. Gopal is now even more successful and slightly arrogant about his wealth. His daughter is very close to Ibrahim's family and considers his son Hamid as her brother. Someone sends an anonymous letter about their relationship and Gopal cuts off all contact with Ibrahim and fixes his daughter's wedding with one of his relatives. Ibrahim comes to know about this and kicks his son out of the house, Hamid joins the army and war is declared almost immediately. Meanwhile Gopal's son and Baldev Singh's daughter â€“ who are both medical students - are in love without their parent's knowledge. Hamid is killed in the war and a letter he wrote before he left for battle makes it clear to Gopal that his daughter and Hamid were just like siblings. Gopal and Ibrahim reconcile. Gopal suddenly suffers a huge loss in business and is unable to pay the dowry for his daughter. When the groom's family pressures him, his neighbours pay him money for the dowry. Gopal finally learns the difference between friends and enemies and arranges his daughter's marriage with Naidu's son. Naidu agrees on the condition that Gopal agrees to get his son married to Baldev Singh's daughter. The neighbours finally become one large happy family.
