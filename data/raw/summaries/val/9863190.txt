A very disfigured Paul  escapes from the creek and wanders through the woods, leaving pieces of his own flesh in the way. When he finally makes it to the highway, his body explodes when he is hit by a school bus. His remains are checked by Deputy Winston Olsen , the local policeman from the previous film. Winston assures the shocked bus driver that he had hit a moose. The creek Paul was lying in was connected to a bottled-water company and the infected water was distributed to the local high school. John , a senior at the high school, is deciding whether to go to prom with his long-time crush Cassie  or stay home. His friend Alex  is against going until he hooks up with a girl named Liz . She then says if she can get off work that night, she'll meet him there. John asks Cassie to go to prom but she refuses. Meanwhile, Winston is at a restaurant where a worker from the bottled-water company dies from the infection. He then realizes the creek got heavily contaminated and goes to the water plant to tell the officials that the water is contaminated. The worker he informs is quickly killed by a group of CCD  soldiers in NBC suits. Winston leaves before they can get to him. At the high school the infection begins to spread slowly. Alex is disappointed that Liz didnâ€™t come, while John gets into a fight with Cassie's boyfriend Marc . Principal Sinclair ([[Michael Bowen  then kicks John out. Cassie follows him and John confesses his love to her. Frederica  dies in the swimming pool from the infection and Rick  is killed when he drowns after hitting his head on the side of the pool and falling in. CCD then force John and Cassie back into the school. The CCD locks all of the main exits from the school and kill Principal Sinclair when he demands to know what is going on. The infection then begins to kill the students in the gym at an alarming rate. Sandy , the most popular girl in school is also murdered. The gym is then gassed from the outside. Cassie, John, and Alex watch in horror as all the students are killed. Winston is picked up by his cousin Herman , ready to leave town. Alex discovers he is infected and that the disease is incurable necrotizing fasciitis. The only way to stop the infection is to amputate the infected limb. However, Alex' infection is already too severe and he stays behind. John begins to show signs of the infection too and lets Cassie amputate his hand to stop it. Cassie's boyfriend Marc then comes out of nowhere, hits Cassie with a hammer, and tries to kill John but Cassie kills him with a nail gun. The two leave the school only to be ambushed by the CCD. John stalls them, allowing Cassie to escape. She finds herself on the highway and stops Herman's van. Winston and Herman take Cassie with them, not knowing she is possibly infected. The end of the movie shows Alex's date Liz at her workplace. She is a stripper at Teazers. She spreads the infection to her customers, who in turn spread it further around the country and even to Mexico. She arrives home later that night, sick, and goes to bed, thinking "I should've fucking gone to prom." After the credits, Dan and Darren are shown watching TV and Dan says "Prom blows."
