The unexpected death of her husband sends Agnes Browne  and her seven children, aged between 2 and 14, into emotional turmoil and financial crisis in 1967 Dublin. She is forced to borrow money from a ruthless loan shark to make ends meet. She faces her dismal existence by selling fruits and vegetables at an open air market based in Dublin's Moore Street where she spends time with her best friend Marion, who proves to be a great source of encouragement during her difficulties. Wishing to escape her existence, if only for a short time, she dreams of finding enough money to attend an upcoming Tom Jones concert. Agnes's dream is realised when Marion secretly buys two tickets and gives them to her. She also accepts the offer of a date with a French baker. Her kids pool their money and buy her a new dress to wear on her first date. Of course, eventually the family has to face the loan shark.
