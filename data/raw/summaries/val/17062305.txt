It's June and Chauncey Nelson [Deance Wyatt] has just graduated from high school. Where most kids his age will spend their summer getting ready for college, Chauncey's got other plans: kick it with his boy Diego, win a youth boxing tournament and buy an Impala. Of course we all know what happens to even the best laid plans; Chauncey and Diego hang and get hung up in small-time hustles that go sour and the boxing tournament KOs any chance of Chauncey sporting golden gloves. Just as his dream car is about to ride off into the sunset, Chauncey gets it, there's a big difference between having a dream and working hard to make a dream come true.
