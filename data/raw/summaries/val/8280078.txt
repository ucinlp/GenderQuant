This hip-hop comedy from Roc-A-Fella Records' film division stars Beanie Sigel as a hot-headed hood bully that does small robberies to make some cash, Memphis Bleek as a thief of another crew, Myxt Matanza as the bodega owner and Jay-Z as the rapper himself. Kevin Hart plays a character who is part of a crew of thieves who does small time jobs like house breaking. Unfortunately, the crew itself is not exactly a highly polished operation, and the crew's capers result in comic mishaps far more often than actual thefts. They still manage to do some jobs like breaking into Jay-Z's house and robbing some of its material goods, but predictably, they receive prison time for robbery or aggravated assault
