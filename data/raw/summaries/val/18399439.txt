Two years after the defeat of Majin Buu in the main Dragon Ball Z series, Mr. Satan finally finishes construction on his brand new hotel. Feeling guilty that the hotel is in honor of what the majority of Earth believes to be his defeat of Buu, he invites all of the Z-Fighters and their families to a banquet. Goku and Vegeta decide to spar, as they have dressed in their usual fighting outfits. Shortly after dinner, two Saiyan spaceships land just outside of town, and a mysterious Saiyan and his wife confront the Z-Fighters at the hotel. They are revealed to be Vegeta's younger brother, Tarble, who had been deemed too weak to fight in the past and was sent to a distant star before the destruction of Planet Vegeta, and his wife Gure, who is a small, cartoon-like alien. Tarble asks his brother for help in dealing with Abo and Cado, soldiers who are remnants of Frieza's army, who are causing havoc on his planet. Goku and Vegeta argue over who will fight the brothers. Even their sons and friends offer to join in, but so many fighting two people seems unfair, so Goku comes up with an idea to solve the issue. As Abo and Cado land, the Z-Fighters pick radishes from Goku and Chi Chi's garden to determine who will battle the duo. Everyone picks short radishes until Goten picks out the apparent longest. Jealous, Vegeta tells Trunks to pick one that is longer. Pressured by his father, Trunks picks out what appears to be a short radish, but it turns out to be the longest, stretching all the way down to the mountain. This means that Trunks wins and is chosen to fight, and the battle begins. However, Abo and Cado are two opponents and Goku asks Vegeta to let Goten fight with Trunks, but Vegeta says that Trunks is enough. Nevertheless, Goku lets Goten join Trunks, which prompts an angry outburst from Vegeta, who relents after his wife persuades him to agree. When the battle begins, without going Super Saiyan, the children easily defeat the two soldiers. However, when Abo and Cado create doubles of themselves, the boys get beaten easily. Irritated, Vegeta shouts at Trunks to read their ki and says that Trunks has forgotten the basics. When his wife says it is because he never taught Trunks basics, Vegeta says he lacks motivation like her, starting an argument between them which prompts Goku to say that it's not the time for a "marital quarrel". With a little help from Goten's brother Gohan, he and Trunks are able to fight and seem to have the upper hand. Everyone except for Goku, Vegeta, and Piccolo go back to the hotel. As the battle is almost over, Abo and Cado fuse into their larger, more powerful form, Aka. Aka easily devastates Goten and Trunks, slamming them around and tossing them like rag dolls, and everyone comes back. Goten and Trunks try to fuse; while the first is a failure, the second is successful, and they become Gotenks. Gotenks attacks with "Wolf Fang Fist", "Volleyball Fist" and one of his signature moves: "Dynamite Rolling Thunder Punch", which appears to defeat Aka. However, while everyone is celebrating, Aka attacks the boys again with a super move, "Super Destructive Wave", after Gotenks taunts him. Piccolo blocks the attack with a "Special Beam Cannon". Infuriated, Aka destroys most of the hotel with "Wahahanoha" beams while Gotenks protects Tarble and Gure. Seeing Aka's threat growing, Goku and Vegeta join the fight, but Goku tricks Vegeta into looking away while he defeats Aka with a final "Kamehameha". With the battle over, Mr. Satan mourns the loss of his hotel. His daughter Videl  tells him that this serves as a lesson, and he promises to change. Everyone goes back to what's left of the hotel, where their banquet is still waiting. Abo and Cado give up the fight, and join them in the feast. The special ends with Goku and Vegeta fighting over pork and sushi, even going Super Saiyan as they argue, much to the amusement of their friends but the embarrassment of their wives.
