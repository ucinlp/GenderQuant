One day in an icy North American region, a Soviet jet is shot down by an American fighter jet. The Soviet jet crashes and its cargo explodes... a low-level atomic bomb which awakens a giant monster called "Gamera", who has the shape of a giant turtle. Gamera destroys the American jet with his fireball and escapes into the sea. Gamera heads to Japan and surfaces from Sagami Bay, destroys the city, and retreats again to the sea. The scientists and government make a conference to kill the monster. Gamera destroys a research ship, kills the crew, and then heads to Tokyo. But he is sedated, and was dropped by group of bombs. But he awakens in time and his hard shell protected him, and Gamera reveals a new ability: flying. Gamera lands in Haneda Airport and arrives in Tokyo. He wastes no time and begins a rampage. The military observed that he ate fire from the buildings he destroyed, and they devised "Plan X". They lure Gamera using fire, but it won't be easy. Gamera isn't attracted until they made a bigger fire and finally Gamera was attracted by the flame. They attract Gamera into holding a big rocket and Gamera was chained by strong chains, and he was sent into outer space. The rocket was sent into Uranus and humans are safe... but are they safe enough?
