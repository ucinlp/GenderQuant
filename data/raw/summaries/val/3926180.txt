{{Plot}} Franklin  is at first excited when he learns that his parents are going to have a baby. As the winter months drag on, he grows antsy as he knows that the baby is coming in spring, but it seems like the winter is lasting especially long. Worse, he's now becoming confused as some of his friends' comments have led him to wonder if once the baby comes, his parents won't have any time for him. While Franklin is dealing with this, his friend Snail  has a different problem. Franklin is a great friend, who has always had time for him and been nice to him, even when his other friends sometimes leave him behind. Now, though, with Franklin about to become a big brother, he's worried that Franklin won't have any time for him. When Franklin hears again a story he loved as a kid of knight who brought spring to his town, he first suggests it is a class play and then begins thinking that he himself could be the story's hero, the Green Knight and bring spring to Woodland. He enlists Snail as his squire and together they go on a journey which brings them head-to-head with all the issues they've been struggling with. Full Recap Franklin and his friends are out playing in the snow. Bear, Goose, Snail and Beaver are having fun sledding and skating, but Franklin's up to something else. He's down at the bottom of the hill, making turtles from the snow. Back up at the top, his friends don't seem to have any idea where he is. But they hope they'll "run into him." And they do indeed, as they slide down the hill. They lose control and narrowly avoid slamming into Franklin and his snowturtles. Back on solid footing, they consider Franklin's snowturtles. He says they're of his family, but there's four of them. Snail thinks that the fourth one must be him. It isn't, though, as Franklin explains that there are going to be four turtles in his family. His Mom's having a baby! It's coming in the Spring. He doesn't know if it's a boy or a girl, but he does know one thing: he's always wanted to be a big brother. Snail seems less excited than everyone else. He wonders if Franklin isn't happy with his friends. Beaver's also a pessimist. She wants to make sure that Franklin knows that "babies aren't fun all the time. This leads into the story's first musical number: Brothers and Sisters A bright, upbeat piece in which Bear talks sings about his baby sister, Goose sings about her baby brother and Beaver serves as the naysayer, talking about all the gross things babies do. Franklin concludes that even if babies do gross things, he's still going to love his baby brother or sister, as they'll still be family. "The wonderful thing about brothers and sisters / Sisters and brothers are wonderful thing / The thing we like about brothers and sisters... / Is just about everything." Franklin's friends all gather around him and chant "Big Brother Franklin." The narrator speaks again, saying that Franklin couldn't wait for Spring to come, but Spring was in no hurry. The time frame advances from January to March. Franklin, in his house, talks with his parents. Mr. Turtle reminds him that the baby is due next month, regardless of whether Spring comes or not. Mrs. Turtle suggests that maybe they need the "Green Knight" to bring Spring to Woodland. Franklin remembers the story of the Green Knight. Mrs. Turtle used to read it to him all the time when he was younger. He'd like to read it again. So Mrs. Turtle pulls out the storybook, which was given to her by Great Aunt Harriet and begins the tale. The tale tells of a village that was covered in snow. The people were worried that if winter continued much longer, they wouldn't be able to plant their crops and they would starve. So brave knights came from all around, but none could solve the problem. Then, the Green Knight, who lived in a castle overlooking the town, decided to take to the task. With the help of his Squire, he set out for a way to bring Spring to the village. They first came across a Goblin in need of help. They helped him and in return, he told them how they could bring Spring to the village. Deep in the forest, at the end of a rainbow, was a tree that always had cherry blossoms, as old as time itself. If they took the branches and scattered them across the land, Spring would come. So they headed for the cherry tree and tried to take the blossoms. But a Guardian appeared and told the Green Knight that the blossoms were not his to take. He first had to prove himself worthy. Then, he and his Squire were faced with a dragon. The dragon's hide was practically impenetrable, but the Green Knight recognized the dragon's weakness: its tail. Since the Green Knight was a frog, he didn't have any teeth. So he had his Squire bite into the dragon's tail and the dragon ran away. The Green Knight talked about how wonderful it was and how great the villagers would think that he was. Then, the Guardian of the Tree appeared and told him he couldn't take the cherry blossoms. The dragon may have been slain, but his motives were not worthy. The Green Knight admits that he was wrong and lays down his sword, saying that a true knight acts with a true heart. The Guardian tells him that with those words, he has proved himself worthy and may take the blossoms. The Green Knight and his Squire thank the Guardian. They return to the village, where the Green Knight spreads the blossoms. They melt all the snow, sending Spring sweeping across the entire village. Franklin says that the thought it was a great story and asks Mrs. Turtle read it again. Mrs. Turtle, though, is tired, so she says that maybe she'll read it tomorrow. On the bus the next day, Beaver comments that Spring better come soon, as the winter is becoming "very boring." Snail, however, wishes that Spring would never come. He's worried about what will happen when Franklin gets his baby brother or sister. At school, Mr. Owl asks for suggestions for activities. Beaver suggests a bake sale and her idea is approved. Franklin says that they should put on a play. He talks about the "Green Knight" story and everyone in the class seems to know it. So Mr. Owl says that they'll put on a play: "The Quest of the Green Knight." Franklin is cast for the role of the Green Knight because, well, he is green and the play was his idea. That afternoon, Franklin, Rabbit, Beaver, Bear and Goose are all outside playing. They complain about all of the snow. Beaver thinks that it must be the snow hiding Spring, making a segue for the second musical number: Spring, Where Are You? Part 1 Another mostly upbeat number with lead vocals by a female singer. The gang searches around Woodland, hoping to find signs that Spring might be coming. Goose takes to the skies. Rabbit sets up a picnic, but Bear shakes snow off a tree, burying him. The entire gang piles on top each other, hoping if they look high enough, they'll find Spring. But they just end up toppling over. Bear and Beaver lie in lawn chairs, wearing sunglasses and drinking juice. But the juice freezes up. Lyrics include such lines as "All of us search, for one special thing / 'Cause we hope to find the first sign of spring" and "Spring time, please come out, now don't you shy / No, Spring time, can't you even try?" After the musical number, Beaver suggests that maybe Spring is just asleep. Franklin agrees that must be the problem and suggests that they should try to wake it up. This leads to musical number three: Spring, Where Are You? Part 2 A more upbeat version of the previous song, sung by the characters. They make their own music, doing such things as using Franklin's shell as if it were a drum. The objective is to make as much noise as possible, hoping to wake Spring up. However, seeing all of the snow still around, they realize it isn't working and the song ends on a downbeat note. Franklin returns to his house and finds that his Granny is there. She's come to help out around the house. She tells Franklin that one of the things she has to help with is the baby shower. Franklin wonders how they can wash the baby if it isn't even born yet. Granny explains that the baby shower is sort of like a party for the baby. The scene changes and Franklin is with Rabbit and Beaver. They're by Franklin's snowturtles, which have lasted since January, due to the extended freezing conditions. Rabbit comments that maybe that's something good about winter, that Franklin's snowturtles are still around. But Beaver says that there is nothing good about winter. Franklin tells them his family is having a party. They want to know if they can come, but Franklin explains that he thinks it's just for adults. Rabbit and Beaver quickly figure out that Franklin's family is throwing a baby shower. They tell him that's not a good thing: if his family is already throwing parties for the baby now, think about what will happen when the baby is born. Franklin can basically forget about his parents, as they'll be too busy taking care of the baby to pay any attention to him. Then, they laugh and make "goo-goo gah-gah" jokes, but Franklin seems to be taking them pretty seriously. We see the Turtle family baby shower. It's a big affair and lots of people from Woodland are there. There's Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, Mr. and Mrs. Bear, Mr. and Mrs. Fox, Mrs. Goose, Mr. Owl, Mr. Mole and more. Franklin, meanwhile, is hoping that maybe there's a present for him. But all of the labels say that they're for "Baby Turtle." He hides under a table and cries, saying that his friends were right. Then, he hears the grown-ups talking about how long the winter seems to be lasting. Granny says that it has been a long one and suggests that maybe they need the Green Knight to save them. Franklin, listening from under the table, decides that he'll be the Green Knight. He'll bring Spring to Woodland and everyone will be so proud of him. Before setting out, Franklin does some homework. He asks his Dad where he might find a cherry orchard. He asks Granny how one would go about finding a Squire and he asks his Mom about food and ends up taking a plate of cookies for his journey, sight unseen. He dresses up as the Green Knight and leaves the next morning. In the meantime, all of his friends are headed to Beaver's house, where they're going to be working on the play. Snail is headed to Franklin's to return a glove that Franklin let him borrow to keep him warm. Bear runs by him, then stops when Snail yells for him. He explains that he's returning the glove to Franklin. Bear tells him to hurry, or else he'll be late getting to Beaver's and dashes off. Snail sighs. He cries when he sees Franklin's snowturtle, saying that Franklin's baby sibling will be lucky, as they'll have someone to help them with their homework and make sure they're never late. Then, Franklin comes. Snail notices his costume and says that he's dressed for the play. Franklin tells him that it isn't for the play, he really is the Green Knight. Snail returns the glove and tells Franklin that he has to get going, or he'll be late getting to Beaver's. But Franklin has a different idea. He asks Snail if he'd like to be his Squire. Snail accepts. Franklin dubs him Squire Snail using his paper-construct sword and they set off on their journey. The scene changes to the Beaver residence. Bear is enjoying some muffins baked by Mrs. Beaver. He's eaten a whole bunch and comments that Franklin better get there soon, or else that won't be any muffins' left. At the Turtle household, Mrs. Turtle is preparing breakfast. Granny and Mr. Turtle arrive and they all wonder where Franklin is. Then, Granny remembers that Mr. Owl said during the baby shower that the class was having a meeting in the morning to prepare for the play, so that's probably where he is. Mrs. Turtle thinks that it's unlike Franklin to leave without saying anything, but they decide that Franklin probably just wanted to get a head start and didn't want to wake them up. Back in the woods, Franklin and Snail get lost. Franklin's not really sure of the path to the cherry orchard. Snail remembers how in the "Green Knight" story, a Goblin told the hero which way to go. Franklin's not sure how this will help. The scene-changes to a guy who's just getting up. He goes and looks out his window. However, when he tries to remove his head, he finds that he's gotten stuck. Embarrassed at first, he's silent. But then, realizing that he needs to get loose, he calls for help. Franklin and Snail hear his cries. They come to him and ask if he needs help. The man at first denies needing any help, as he's still embarrassed, but then admits that, well, maybe he is stuck. They prepare to get him unstuck, but then he yells out, saying that maybe it would be better if they pulled from the, well, "wider" end. The door in the back is unlocked. So they go in and free the man, Mr. Gopher. He thanks them and asks if there's anything he can do to help them. Franklin explains that they're on a quest to bring Spring to Woodland and that they need to know where to find the cherry orchard. Mr. Gopher knows where it is and directs them to the right path. They thank him and leave. Mr. Gopher heads to his window to say goodbye to them. He gets stuck again and this time, they're too far away to help him. He's also very embarrassed this time and afraid to say anything. So Franklin and Snail continue on their quest. They come to a spooky section of the woods and Snail starts to get scared. There was a dragon in the story and he's worried that they're going to encounter something similar. He tells Franklin that he's scared, but Franklin says that he's the Green Knight and nothing scares him. But then they hear the screech of an eagle  and try to run. They think they've escaped it, but then it comes in for a landing. Franklin draws his paper-construct sword, as if he's going to fight it. But the eagle speaks, saying that she's Eagle and she has no wish to fight Franklin. She does think it's very odd, though, to see a turtle with a snail on his back. They tell her that they're headed for the cherry orchard. She says that it's across the mountain and offers them a ride. The scene changes to the Beavers', where Fox is showing off his dragon costume. Bear likes it. Badger is working on paper-construct flowers. Bear pretends to fly using wings he's constructed to himself. He yells "I'm flying" and the scene changes to Franklin yelling "I'm flying! I'm flying!" as he and Snail fly through the sky, being carried by Eagle's claws. Snail reminds him that they're flying, not just him. They soar across the cliff between the mountains as majestic music plays in the background. They reach the mountain. Eagle drops them off, saying that she has eaglets to tend to. But if they need her help, they should just raise their voices to the wind and she'll come. Franklin wants to keep going. Snail, however, emphasizes that that they're on the quest, not just Franklin. He says that he wants to rest. He tells Franklin that if he's in such a hurry and won't let him rest, then he can find Spring himself. Franklin says that's fine, he will! Snail says to himself that it's just as he thought. Now that Franklin's going to be a big brother, he doesn't need him anymore. This leads into the final musical number of the movie: I Wonder A sad, melancholy, but beautifully sung number in which Franklin and Snail deal with their feelings about being alone. Snail sings about how Franklin must not need him any more, now that he's going to be a big brother. Franklin sings that he's just going to have to do things on his own and admits to himself that he's really just afraid of being alone. He decides to go find Snail, as they can be alone together. Lyrics include lines such as "I guess when Mom and Dad have their baby / I really wouldn't matter anyway" and "I think I'll go and find my best friend, Snail / I guess we'll be alone, just him and me." As the number ends, Snail is riding on a log in a stream. The log heads towards a waterfall, putting Snail in imminent danger. a.k.a. distress signal just like Larry-Boy! And the Fib from Outer Space! Snail yells for Franklin for help. He was about to fall down the fall until Franklin scoops him up just before he falls. Snail wonders how Franklin rescued him so quickly and Franklin explains that he was on his way back. He wants to apologize to Snail for leaving him behind. They continue on their quest and reach the cherry tree. However when they try to approach it to get the blossoms, a small, yellow bird begins pecking at them. They think she must be the Guardian of the Tree. She yells for them to go away and not steal her eggs and continues pecking at them. Finally, Franklin traps her in his cape. She pecks her beak through the cape and demands that Franklin let her go. They explain that they're not there to steal her eggs. They just want to get blossoms from the tree to bring Spring to Woodland. Franklin says that with the blossoms, he'll bring Spring to Woodland and everyone will pay attention to him. Snail tells him that's a selfish reason to want the blossoms and he's acting just the Green Knight. Mrs. Warbler tells them to hold the thought, as she needs to get food. She asks Franklin to take care of her eggs. Franklin climbs the tree and covers the eggs with his cape. As he's in the tree, somebody rolls towards Snail in a ball, spooking him. He yells for Franklin's help and Franklin comes down and draws his paper-construct sword, telling the stranger to leave Snail along. Then, somebody else comes, telling Franklin to leave his baby brother alone. He and Franklin fight, tearing the paper-construct sword. We see that the stranger, Young Armadillo is actually very scared. He's just a little kid. Franklin says that it was Young Armadillo that scared them. He drew his sword because he was the "Green Knight" and he thought Young Armadillo was the dragon. Armadillo introduces his younger brother. Franklin shares his cookies with the Armadillos. They have flies in them. Not scared any more, Young Armadillo runs around happily with Snail on his back. As he runs around, Franklin and Armadillo talk. Franklin says that Armadillo must like taking care of his baby brother and that he's going to be a big brother. Armadillo senses that Franklin is worried that his parents won't have time for him once the baby is born. He asks Franklin who he loves more: his Mom, or his Dad. Franklin complains that it's a silly question and says that he loves them both. Armadillo says that's his point, he has enough love for both his parents and his parents will have enough love for both him and his sibling. It's nothing to worry about. Armadillo and Young Armadillo have to leave. Snail says to Franklin that he didn't know Franklin was worried. He says that he's worried too: that Franklin won't have time to spend with him once the baby is born. Franklin tells him that he'll be busy with the baby, but he'll still have time for his friends. Mrs. Warbler returns and thanks Franklin for taking care of her eggs. Franklin begins to leave, saying that he's not worthy of the cherry blossoms. He admits that he was being selfish. He says that what he really wants is for everyone in Woodland to not have to worry any more. Mrs. Warbler tells him that's a very unselfish reason for wanting the blossoms and as Guardian of the Tree, she'll let him take as many as he needs. So Franklin and Snail gather the blossoms. The scene changes to Beaver's place, where Bear is drumming, causing Beaver to mess up a painting. The Turtles arrive with food. Mr. Turtle asks where Franklin is . Bear says that he thought Franklin was with them. They put two and two together, that, based on Franklin's questions the night before, he must have decided to try to set out on his own, as the Green Knight. Back at the mountain, Franklin and Snail reach the end of the first mountain. From up there, they can see all of Woodland. Then, they take a tumble. Franklin asks if Snail is okay and Snail says that it's fun. They continue, until they reach another cliff. But then, Franklin slips and drops the cherry blossoms, which fall and get stuck on a tree branch. Franklin and Snail call for Eagle's help. The scene changes again to the Beavers'. A search is being organized to find Franklin and Snail. But before it can get started, Franklin and Snail come in for a landing on Eagle's back. At first, Beaver is scared of Eagle, but then Eagle tickles her. Mrs. Turtle asks if Franklin is hurt, but he says he's all right. Franklin and Snail introduce Eagle. Eagle says that she was pleased to help Franklin and Snail, but now she has to attend to her eaglets. She flies away and Beaver yells for her to not be a stranger. Beaver wonders why Franklin is dressed as the Green Knight and Snail tells her that Franklin is the Green Knight. Franklin sets the cherry blossoms sailing in the wind. They land, but nothing seems to happen. Bear tells Franklin it was a good try and Franklin says he thought Spring would just appear. Then, Snail finds a crocus growing from the ground. He also sees a bird chirping in a tree and everyone realizes that Spring is coming after all. It's time for a montage of scenes. It's raining and Franklin and Bear hop in a puddle. Elsewhere, Fox flies a kite on a beautiful, sunny day. Beaver and Rabbit ride by on their bikes. Franklin, Mr. Turtle and Mrs. Turtle set up the baby's crib. Franklin puts a mobile on it. A mother bird feeds her young. Franklin stares contentedly at one of his cherry blossoms in a vase. The "Green Knight" play goes off without a hitch. The cast, from left to right as they take their bows, is Badger, Bear, Goose, Rabbit, Fox, Beaver and Franklin. The scene changes to the after-play party. Snail has his head buried in a piece of cake. Mrs. Turtle says that it's "time." She's going into labor! Dr. Bear is there and Mrs. Turtle and Mr. Turtle are escorted out to go to the hospital. Granny reassures Franklin that everything will be okay. That night, Franklin is by himself, staring at the crib, with the mobile spinning around. He tells his stuffed dog, Sam, that Great Aunt Harriet sent the mobile. Granny comes in, saying that Franklin has been very quiet. She takes Franklin outside, down to a nearby pond, where she tells Franklin that she'll catch a star for him. She has him cover his eyes and when he opens them, she presents him with a lit candle. She explains that when she was kid, it was a tradition every Spring to make a wish, then light a candle and place it on the water to float away. Franklin sets the candle on the water and says that he wishes that he'll see his parents home tonight. Franklin and Granny head for home and there's a light on. Franklin starts to run, then he remembers Granny and comes back for her. At home, we see the baby. It's a girl! She's wearing a purple hair ribbon. The baby laughs at the mobile. She seems to like it. Granny asks Mr. Turtle and Mrs. Turtle if they have a name for her. Mr. Turtle starts that they have some ideas, but Franklin interrupts, saying that they should name her "Harriet." He says that Great Aunt Harriets always gives the best gifts and the baby is like a perfect present. Mrs. Turtle thinks that it's a wonderful name, so Harriet it is. Franklin asks if she remembers when she brought him home from the hospital. Mrs. Turtle says that she'll never forget it. Then, Franklin remembers something. He takes his cherry blossom and places it in Harriet's crib. He says that it's for her. By the way, he's Franklin. He's her big brother. The scene changes to the outside of the Turtle family house. It pans to the starry night sky. A couple of stars twinkle and the movie ends.
