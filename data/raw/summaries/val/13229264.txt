Ten people in Baltimore deal with their respective romantic problems, usually thwarted by the differing ideals and desires of their chosen partner. At the center of this is Gigi , a young woman who repeatedly misinterprets the behavior of her romantic partners.  Gigi is a single woman who repeatedly misreads mundane actions and comments from her dates as indications they are romantically interested in her. She then frets when the guy doesn't call. In attempting to meet Conor at a bar, she befriends the bar owner Alex  who reveals the strategies men use to avoid a woman. He explains that if a man is interested in a woman, he will overcome any obstacles to ensure they date again, and that Gigi has been misinterpreting and obsessing over imagined "signs" she receives from men. This friendship continues and Gigi interprets his eagerness to always assist, such as taking Gigi's call while he is on a date, as a sign that he is interested in her. She eventually makes a move but Alex claims he is not interested in her romantically. Gigi has moved on from Alex, no longer desperately trying to construct evidence the man is interested in her. However, in a role reversal, Alex began mooning over Gigi. After leaving several unanswered messages Alex arrives at Gigi's apartment to declare his love. They kiss and start dating.

Ben and Anna pursue a flirtatious friendship under the pretense of him helping her establish a singing career. Ben reveals to Anna that Janine coerced him into marriage by threatening to leave if he didn't propose.

Their contractor Javier, aggressively interrogated by Janine, says none of his workers smoke at the house. During a tense shopping trip to select flooring, Ben reveals to Janine that he has cheated on her. Janine is devastated but rationalizes Ben's behavior, blaming herself for being too cold in the relationship, and declares she wants to save their marriage. After a positive meeting about her singing career, Anna begins to have sex with Ben in his office. They are interrupted by Janine who, hoping to spice up their marriage, has arrived unexpectedly. Anna hides in a closet and Ben attempts to send Janine away. But she makes a heartfelt plea to save their marriage, and there are indications she succeeds in seducing him.

When Ben arrives home he finds his clothes neatly folded with a whole carton of cigarettes and a note attached from Janine asking for a divorce. Janine moves into a new apartment by herself to start a new life. Anna is later seen performing at an upscale nightclub.

Like Gigi, she meets many men , but despite constantly monitoring emails, pager, phone, and Myspace messages, the "meetings" go nowhere. ; While Conor attempts to cultivate a gay clientele, two gay men tell him how he is going wrong with Anna.

Gigi's other co-worker, Beth , is living with her boyfriend, Neil , who is also friends with Ben. After seven years together, Beth wants to get married, but Neil does not believe in marriage. With Gigi's newfound pragmatic stance on relationships after advice from Alex, she announces that she will no longer misinterpret vague gestures from men as more than they really are. This spurs Beth to confront Neil about their relationship. When he still does not want to get married, she breaks up with him. Later, the fraught preparations for her younger sister Paige's  wedding bring the issue into sharper focus to Beth. During the reception, her father  suffers a heart attack. Beth looks after him as he recuperates while her sisters sit moping and their husbands remain glued to the television.
