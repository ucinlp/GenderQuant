In a prologue, a docile man suddenly kills his wife in a violent method, and then commits suicide. Several months later, graphic artist Jodi and struggling author Mick Davison  move to Stepford, Connecticut, in the same house, hoping that life in the seemingly idyllic town will help rejuvenate their troubled marriage. Jodi reunites with old college friend Caroline  and meets the brilliant Dr. Borzage  as well as the intimidating Miriam Benton , who heads a powerful women's group. Mick notices the docile men in the community, including Caroline's husband , but befriends sloppy neighbor Gordon; both agree they are unnerved by the community. However, both Jodi and Mick are concerned when Gordon undergoes a radical behavior change after a stay at the Stepford Institute for Human Behavior, afterwords thinking only of wife Lisa, but ignoring his son and other interests. Caroline subtly manipulates the Davisons and drugs Mick at a party. When Mick reacts to the drug, Jodi is convinced her husband has serious problems and commits him to The Stepford Institute for a cure. Mick is given mind altering behavioral therapy and psychotropic drugs, altering him to behave docily, but passionless. Jodi is concerned about the drugs Mick takes as part of the therapy; when she learns that the previous couple in her house  was linked to heavy drugs, she replaces Mick's drugs with placebos. The serious side effects of the treatment becomes clear, the men can become violent, and Mick crashes and threatens to kill Jodi. They reconcile when he is convinced she didn't know of the Institute's motives or methods.  They plan to leave immediately. Caroline has learned of the Davisons' plan to leave town. With the other residents, Caroline captures them in their own house. Mick is returned to the Institute for reconditioning, while Jodi is forced to escape to rescue Mick. Benton allows Jodi to find Mick in the Institute, but with Dr. Borzage, plans to kill her. Borzage, however, is alarmed by the out of control ethics and kills Benton with a hypodermic needle meant for Jodi. Borzage then allows the Davisons to escape. In the epilogue, the fate of the town is not revealed, but Jodi and Mick have returned to New York, Mick has written a book about the experience, and a movie will soon be made.
