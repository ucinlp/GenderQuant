The film is a lighthearted story of four teenage girlfriends of various temperaments who escape from their parents for a few days in 1963 for an adventure in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina where the big spring festival promises a dance contest, beer blasts and lots of cute boys. Phoebe Cates  is engaged to a rich but square young man, Bridget Fonda  fancies herself as a Hollywood sexpot, Page Hannah  wears glasses and is a prim and proper senator's daughter, and Annabeth Gish  has recently lost weight but has always been called "Pudge" and suffers from low self-esteem. The trip is spurred by the upcoming marriage of Carson. During their busy weekend at Myrtle Beach, the four find romance, dance up a storm, and make serious life decisions. Their story chronicles their last good-bye to girlhood, and entree into womanhood and focuses on both the girls' moral quandaries and their budding sexualities.
