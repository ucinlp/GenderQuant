Claire Poussin, a young woman in her early 30s whose mother has recently died from Alzheimer's, has been having memory loss problems since being struck by lightning. She believes she is showing the first signs of the disease, but her sister Nathalie thinks the problem is temporary. Claire seeks help by entering a clinic for people with memory-loss problems, which is located in a big country house and run by Prof. Christian Licht. Prof. Licht is having an affair with therapist Marie Bjorg, which he thinks is hidden from his patients, but isn't. At the clinic, Claire meets Philippe, a noted wine expert who is traumatized following a car accident which killed his wife and child, and they fall in love. When both of them are released, they move in together, but find that their condition severely affects their lives. Bernard recovers his memory, and is pained when he remembers the tragic accident, while Claire's condition becomes worse.
