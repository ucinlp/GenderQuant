"Cosmic Voyage" takes on a similar format as the National Film Board of Canada's "Cosmic Zoom", and IBM's classic "Powers of Ten" educational video. The film takes viewers on a journey through forty-two orders of magnitude, beginning at a celebration in Italy to zoom to the edge of the observable universe. The view descends back to earth, and later zooms in upon a raindrop on a leaf, to the level of sub-atomic particles . In addition, the film offers some brief insight on the Big Bang Theory, black holes, and the development of our Solar System. It also simulates a journey through Fermilab's Tevatron particle accelerator in Chicago, where an atom collision is depicted.
