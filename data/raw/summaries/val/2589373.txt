A young spunky piglet, named Gordy , lives on Meadow Brook Farm somewhere in Arkansas. After his father is taken up North to an undetermined fate , the piglet learns from the farm's rooster that his mother and siblings were taken while he pursued his father. Determined to locate his family and return to the farm, Gordy heads out alone to find them. He eventually ends up in the care of Jinnie Sue MacAllister , a young upbeat country singer who lives in a camper van with her also country singer father, Luke , and their "manager", Cousin Jake . Jinnie Sue, not knowing Gordy's name, calls him Pinky. They travel to a dinner party where Luke performs for the governor of Arkansas. Also there is rich businessman, Henry Royce , his daughter Jessica , her rather dull but scheming fianc√©, Sipes , and Jessica's lonely young son Hanky. Hanky wanders off on his own and meets Gordy and Jinnie Sue. Hanky falls into a swimming pool, but cannot swim. Jinnie Sue rushes off to get help, but Gordy dives into the pool with an inflatable and saves Hanky. Grateful, Hanky is given Gordy as a pet. Gordy's bravery also makes him suddenly famous. Royce and Sipes have alternate decisions on who the new mascot of the Royce company should be: Gordy or Jessica. In the end, Gordy wins, due to a switched camera lens used on Jessica's promotion. Sipes is determined to remove Gordy and then take control of the company. He sends his two guards, Dietz and Krugman to kidnap Gordy, but Gordy and Hanky escape on board a school bus, which the two men pursue. On the way, they are distracted briefly by a cross-dressing thief, and discover that Gordy and Hanky have escaped onto a feeding truck. The two unexpectedly meet up with the MacAllisters, who learn from the radio that Hanky has apparently runaway. Another bulletin follows, revealing Henry Royce has died of a heart attack. The MacAllisters return Hanky and Gordy to the Royce building in St. Louis, Missouri where an attorney reveals Henry has left his company to Hanky and Gordy. Cousin Jake, upon learning Gordy's family is missing, organizes a giant country-wide search to locate them and also a country music concert in Branson, Missouri in Gordy's name. A host of country singers perform, as well as a surprise speech from President Bill Clinton  who unveils a new stamp of Gordy. Sipes sends his men to kill Gordy but he is saved by Cousin Jake. Jake returns Gordy to Hanky and Jinnie Sue. Everyone learns from someone who calls into the telethon where Gordy's parents are going to be slaughtered at an unidentified slaughterhouse in Nebraska. Sipes tries to hide the fact that the very same slaughterhouse is owned by the Royce family. However, a battle happens between Sipes and Luke, Jessica and Luke knocking him out with the suitcase of Brinks, the family attorney. Gordy, Hanky, Jinnie Sue, Jessica, Luke, Cousin Jake and Brinks race to stop the slaughterhouse from killing Gordy's parents but a train slows them down. Hanky successfully rings the lovestruck supervisor and the slaughterhouse is shut down just in time. To Gordy's happiness his parents and siblings have survived and he is reunited with his father who was also about to be killed at the slaughterhouse. The pigs are moved back to the farm, which Luke and Jessica decide to buy with most of the Royce Company profits, the two marry and Hanky, Jinnie Sue and Cousin Jake move in too. Gordy has a happy ending, his family together again with new members.
