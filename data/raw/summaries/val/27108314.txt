The film is shot as if extraterrestrials were making a documentary about humans. A voice-over gives the analysis of the extraterrestrials. This external point of view allows to analyze the human behavior. The aim is to make the beholder think about his condition of human being. Two couples are studied: the husband of the first couple and the wife of the second are trapped into an invisible cage while the two others are studied in their environment. Extraterrestrials are doing experiments on the two prisoners.http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=109257.html
