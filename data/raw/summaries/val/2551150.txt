Coach Roy McCormick  was once college basketball's top mastermind. His attention began to turn on what endorsement contracts he could secure instead of actually coaching his team. Roy lets his temper get the best of him in most situations, and after accidentally killing an opposing teams mascot during a game, he's banned  from coaching college level basketball until he can show that he can control his anger. Roy impatiently waits for a coaching position, yet nobody calls. Eventually, he receives only one offer: Mount Vernon Junior High School, coach Roy's Alma Mater. His former school's basketball team, the Smelters, is looking for somebody to coach the team. Although irritated, Roy reluctantly accepts the offer after being demoted from his college coaching position, hoping that a few weeks at the school will prove his good intentions and restore him to his high-living ways as a celebrated college coach. As Roy begins coaching the squad, he gets into an embarrassing situation that he's never been in before and decides, enough is enough. He eventually starts teaching the concepts of basketball to his new team. With teaching and learning being done between both Roy and the kids, the Smelters eventually start having success. Unexpectedly, this leads Roy to find what he's been missing this whole time...not a big coaching gig, not high-dollar endorsement deals, and not even his name in lights...but his simple love of the game.
