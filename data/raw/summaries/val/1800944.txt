Based on Hancock's childhood memories of Bournemouth, the movie is both filmed and set in 1963 in the sleepy fictional seaside town of Piltdown. Hancock plays Wally Pinner, the unhappily married Punch and Judy Man. Wally and the other beach entertainers, the Sandman  who makes sand sculptures, and Neville the photographer  are socially unacceptable to the town's snobbish elite. Wally's wife, Delia , runs a typical seaside curios shop of the time below their flat, and is socially ambitious. To achieve this she needs to have Wally invited to entertain at the official reception for Lady Jane Caterham , who is to switch on the town's illuminations, and at the Mayoress' suggestion the Reception Committee invites Wally to entertain. The illumination ceremony ends in farce when Wally's electric shaver shorts out some of the lights, causing some of the illuminated signs to display unflattering comments about the town. The dinner degenerates into a food fight when one of the drunken guests heckles Punch, and when Lady Jane rounds on Wally, Delia floors her with a punch. Her dreams of social acceptance are gone, but Wally and Delia retire, wiser and closer.
