Russia has developed a high-accuracy weapon for single strategic operations: a fifth-generation jet fighter, the Sukhoi Su-XX, nicknamed Sabre-Toothed. Suddenly, one pilot is mysteriously killed, and the FSB discovers his death was not accidental. A terrorist plot is investigated jointly by Russian, American, and British special services.
