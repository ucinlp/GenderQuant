In 1750, David Garrick, the famous English actor, announces onstage that he has been invited to Paris to work with the prestigious Comédie-Française. A person in the audience jeers that they want him to teach them how to act. When word reaches Paris, the story has become so garbled that the remark is attributed to Garrick himself. The outraged French actors, led by their president, Picard , decide to humiliate Garrick. They take over an inn where he will be staying, and the playwright Beaumarchais  devises a plot intended to frighten Garrick into returning to England. Garrick however is warned by Jean Cabot , an admirer who works as a Comédie-Française prompter. He plays along, ignoring the misgivings of his servant Tubby . A complication arises when Germaine Dupont, Countess de la Corbe , arrives at the inn soon after. Garrick believes she is one of the actresses , when she is actually fleeing a marriage arranged by her father. She falls in love with Garrick, and he plays along. Meanwhile, the French try to discomfort the Englishman with a sword fight, a shootout between a husband and his wife's lover, a mad waiter , and at the end, a violent blacksmith. After overhearing the "blacksmith" remind himself to hit his anvil, not Garrick's head, with his hammer, Garrick disguises himself as the blacksmith and, pretending to be drunk, tells the aghast French actors that he has struck and killed their intended victim. Then he reveals his identity. Relieved, Picard apologizes and begs him to join them in Paris. Garrick graciously accepts. Before they leave, however, he criticizes Germaine for her bad acting, infuriating her. At his premiere in Paris, playing Don Juan, Garrick learns that Germaine is not a member of the company. Realizing that she was telling the truth and that he actually loves her, he is too distraught to perform. Fortunately, Jean Cabot informs him that he ran into Germaine and explained the whole thing to her. She forgives him and is in the audience.
