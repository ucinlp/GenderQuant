Iskender is a juggler. Actually he is a magician but everybody else except himself and his childhood friend Maradona, thinks he is a juggler. The two friends undertake a great deal of risk by including Sait to their tour program while they are forced to escape Istanbul. Moreover Father Sait had quit appreciating Iskender years ago. While the tour makes them come much closer, it also results in a magnificent fall-out. Iskender, Maradona and Sait, keep coming back together and falling out with their fellow traveler Fatma.
