Goofy enters home tired after a hard day at work. Exhausted, he suddenly notices an exercise advertisement in his newspaper. He orders gymnastics equipment and with the aid of an instruction record he tries out using the barbells, the chin-up bars and cable expanders, which all meet with disastrous results. Goofy destroys the floors of his apartment in the process and flies out of the window before he is swung back against the muscular chart of his equipment. While he stands behind the cardboard muscular man he is glad that he finally resembles a muscular man.
