{{Plot}} Its Christmas time and after years of living under the floorboards, the Clock family are discovered after their daughter, Arrietty , befriends James , a young 'human bean' boy. After a night playing together, James's grandmother becomes suspicious of her grandson and begins to spy on him, particularly after she starts to see him acting in mysterious ways. Finally, the Grandmother begins to take up the floorboards and discovers her missing things, notably the artifacts from her dollhouse. The Clock family escape to the sewers, where Pod  berates his daughter for having 'spoken to, let alone been seen by a human bean'. The Clock family travel down the sewers and emerge in a city of other little people like themselves, much to Arrietty's dismay, as she had been brought to believe that their family was the only one of their kind. Meanwhile, Professor Mildeye , a professor at a London university, is specialising in the subject of Homo sapiens redactus  but is dismissed by his colleagues as a fantasist. He befriends James's grandmother when she begins to ask him questions about little people, having found out about him online. The Clock family start to explore their new world. Arrietty, with a new urban fashion sense, is nearly run over by Spiller , a biker-type leader. After a confrontation with her, Homily Clock  turns up and makes him apologise, much to Arrietty's annoyance. When it turns out that Arrietty's father has chosen him to guide them to a new place to live, they strike up a friendship of sorts. Professor Mildeye arrives at James's house, determined to find the Clock family in order to examine them dead or alive. James, feigning disbelief at the existence of little people, becomes wary as these events develop. Arrietty then starts playing with the snowflakes as Pod and Homily have a talk about her "mistake". After explaining what snow is to Arriety, and after giving her a heated heart-to-heart about the protected life she's had, Arrietty storms off in anger, but activates a trap set out to capture them by Professor Mildeye. Pod and Homily push her out of the way but become trapped themselves. Pod tells Spiller to take care of Arriety and they escape as Pod and Homily are captured and brought to Mildeye's laboratory. Spiller tries to explain that he tried everything to save Pod and Homily, but Arrietty is determined to and save them. Spiller is shocked and says she will be killed, but they depart on hostile terms. In Professor Mildeye's laboratory, Pod thinks about how to escape, but is happy that his daughter is safe. Professor Mildeye leaves a message on the Hellman family's answer phone explaining to James's grandmother that he has captured Pod and Homily. James intercepts it, and listens in horror before deleting it and rushing off to the university. Meanwhile, Arrietty ventures above ground and is nearly killed by a street cleaning vehicle, but is rescued by Spiller who has reappeared. They head off to a church and hide in the Nativity scene while they work out what to do next. Spiller explains that Pod is a hero in the little world, as he saved their community from the human beans, but he failed to save a little girl, as he was faced with a terrible choice: Arrietty's cousin Eggletina or the entire community. Spiller adds that no-one blamed him for her death, but Pod blamed himself and exiled himself to the Hellman's house to live away from the little people community. Spiller agrees to help Arrietty save her parents. They head back to James Hellman's house, as she is sure he can help them. Pod and Homily attempt to escape but are captured by Mildeye as they hide behind a table leg. As he recaptures them, he discovers they can talk. James arrives at the university, feigning surprise that the Professor was right and the Borrowers do exist. Back home, the grandmother takes a bunch of flowers from the postman which are from Mildeye, who has become infatuated with her. James's dad arrives home with a model aircraft which is a Christmas present for James. James explains to Arrietty and Spiller that Homily and Pod are still alive. Spiller tries to attack James, but Arrietty explains that he's trustworthy. They watch a news clip from BBC News of the anchorman explaining Mildeye's theory, and that there would be a scientific conference the following day. The following morning, James heads to the university with the model aircraft which he found hidden under his late mum's bed, as Mildeye prepares for the conference. Spiller and Arrietty get inside the aircraft, and James launches it  and flies them above the university building from where, after an intimate moment during which the couple nearly kiss, they are dropped onto the building by makeshift parachutes. They make their way through the air conditioning system to a vent above the glass that Pod and Homily are being kept in. Meanwhile, James goes inside the university and distracts Mildeye that there are whole communities of little people living underground. Mildeye calls his assistant out of the lab, giving Arrietty and Spiller a chance to rescue Pod and Homily. At first, Homily is shocked to find Pod smiling, laughing and looking upwards as his daughter and Spiller are rescuing them using string and a paperclip. Mildeye being in the corridor talking to his assistant about James's revelation gives James a chance to open the air conditioning vent in the Professor's office to put a modified remote control car inside for the Borrowers to use as an escape vehicle. James leaves Mildeye's office, and gives Mildeye a board marker. The Professor and his assistant rush back to the office to find that James has drawn silly faces on magazine cut-outs of Mildeye which are hung on the wall. Mildeye realises that his "specimens" are in danger and rushes back to the lab, gaining entry just as Pod is being lifted up towards the air vent. As Mildeye tries to grab him, Spiller attaches himself to the other end of the string and jumps down through the vent, causing Pod to shoot up into it. Spiller, now in the lab, quickly escapes Mildeye and his assistant. The Clock family escape as Arrietty drives the modified remote control car through the air vents, while Mildeye chases the sound of the car through the corridors below. They leave the air conditioning system and drive through the corridors as Mildeye chases them. They make it into a lift in the nick of time, while Mildeye rushes down the stairs. As the lift opens, Arrietty drives the car full speed down a corridor and out over a balcony to the reception area below where James is waiting with a rucksack to catch them. Mildeye arrives at the balcony to see James running away. When they are safely back home, the Clock family and James watch the conference online to see if Mildeye has caught Spiller. When it appears that he has, Mildeye reveals a doll's jacket, much to the mirth of the crowds of press and scientists. They all leave the lecture theatre, leaving Mildeye raging, desperate and humiliated. As James closes the laptop, Spiller appears behind it announcing, "Did you really think they'd catch me?" Arrietty finally admits she likes him, to which Spiller says that the only reason he rescued them was to have the gold coin. James picks up the coin, which turns out to be the missing rare coin that his Grandmother was asking about. James puts the coin on the floor of his mum's bedroom, where his Grandmother later finds it. It turns out that the coin is incredibly valuable, and James and his father sell it to raise money for their house and for Christmas. James's dad is puzzled as to why all of the strawberry cream chocolates are missing from a chocolate tin â€” earlier in the film, we see Pod 'borrowing' them. Under the floorboards, the Clocks and Spiller have their own Christmas, and Pod and Homily reveal to Arrietty that they're ready to allow her to leave the confines of their underfloor home to go wherever she wants. She is overjoyed, and decides she wants to head back to the Borrower city with Spiller. Outside, James and the Clocks say goodbye to Arrietty, and Arrietty and Spiller slide down the drainpipe and the film ends with a still of Arrietty shooting out of the pipe in mid-air. In the post credits, the Grandmother is seen slipping a strawberry cream chocolate down the hole to the Clocks' home, and whispering "Merry Christmas".
