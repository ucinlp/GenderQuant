In the story, Bugs Bunny, asleep in a cotton field, is picked up by his cottony tail  and bundled into a shipment put on a riverboat going down the Mississippi River. The cotton-picking scene is accompanied by presumably African-American voices singing "Dixie". After seeing a steward forcibly eject a ticket-less passenger , Bugs acquires some clothes and presents himself to the steward as a top-hatted gentleman. His self-assurance so clearly implies that he belongs on the boat that the steward hesitates to even ask for a ticket, but rather than browbeat him with his presumed superior station, Bugs simply gives the man a ticket. At this point Bugs could simply relax and enjoy the unexpected trip, which must eventually take the boat back to its starting point and allow him to disembark, but he prefers to seek an adversary with whom he can match wits. He finds one in the Yosemite Sam-esque Colonel Shuffle, a neurotic riverboat gambler played by Billy Bletcher . After Shuffle's gunplay clears out the customer base in the casino , Bugs remains as his only challenger in a poker game. Beginning with a hundred dollar stake , Bugs soon wins all of Shuffle's money including the original half-chip when he tops the cheating Shuffle's hand of five aces with six aces. Literally beaten at his own game , Shuffle challenges Bugs to a pistol duel and an explosion from an exploding cigar, given to Shuffle by Bugs , leaves Shuffle in "blackface" and Bugs leads him in a dance to "De Camptown Races" . After Colonel Shuffle falls into the river and then comes back into the ship , and a failed attempt to shoot Bugs with a waterlogged pistol , Bugs tricks Shuffle into buying a ticket to see "Uncle Tom's Cabinet" , only to fall back into Old Man River. Shuffle again tries to shoot Bugs , only to be reminded that his pistol is wet . Shuffle points the bullet at himself, only to get blasted in the face, apparently leaving only his clothes, but it's revealed not long after that he hid in his hat. Angry, Shuffle chases Bugs down to the boiler room, only to end up in the boiler himself  and being forced to get change from Bugs for a cup to get water , only to shoot at Bugs again when he puts out his fire . Bugs dons southern belle garb and appeals to another passenger to rescue "her" from Shuffle, whom the passenger throws overboard. However, after realizing that the "lady" he has assisted is a rabbit, the dumbfounded man has a nervous breakdown and steps overboard himself. Still in drag, Bugs notes: "Oh well, we almost had a romantic ending."
