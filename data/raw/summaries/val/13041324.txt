Dusty Fletcher plays a comic, tap dancer and bad magician. While practicing his routine for that evening's variety show, he accidentally vanishes Lola , the girlfriend of the show's manager Baltimore Dumdone . She was wearing a thousand-dollar string of pearls and it seems most likely that criminality is afoot. Dusty's slapstick antics take up a large portion of the film's first act, with some Keystone cop type schtick thrown in when four police officers  begin chasing Dusty in and out of his disappearance-cabinet.
