The first character shown is Ruben. A college student, his job at Barako Café  is not nearly enough to pay his tuition. Having lost his scholarship on a technicality,Ruben resorts to burglary in order to cover his educational expenses. What ensues is a comedic overly choreographed fight-scene complete with wire work and overdone martial arts action. Shona leaves her son and her boyfriend  in order to return to work in Japan as an exotic dancer. Her predicament exemplifies the situation of every Filipino person who has come to the realization that life in the Philippines often does not allow the working person to earn money enough to save for a better living. Cher is a drag queen who, because of her sexuality, becomes the victim of violent homophobic aggression. His performance, while exaggeratedly comic, touches on the ugliness of homophobia and sexual discrimination. And yet the issue is never resolved, because Cher’s attackers are not punished for their hate crime. Neither is Shona condemned for abandoning her child in this instance of labor export from the Philippines, and the effects that it has on the people who must be left. Ruben’s moral and practical dilemma remains unresolved as well. The lives of three couples: Iza and Iñigo, Kulas and Joan, and Dino and Faith deal with objectification, unrequited love, and first sexual experiences, respectively.
