The film explores the downward spiral of a retired Hindi professor, Uttam Chaudhary,  as he falls victim to dementia. After he sees someone carelessly place a ash tray on a newspaper photograph of Mahatma Gandhi, his senility increases. One night his daughter Trisha, played by Urmila Matondkar, and son Karan discover his room on fire. Trisha takes him to a doctor who says nothing can be done. Then Uttam believes he killed Mahatma Gandhi by accidentally playing with a toy gun which had real bullets and shooting Gandhi during his walk in Birla House. So they go see Uttam's brother for details. Uttam's brother says that when they were young, they played darts by filling ballons with red dye and placing it on someone's picture. One day someone found Gandhi's picture and Uttam popped a ballon while their father saw who believed he killed Gandhi, with Uttam replying "Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara" while his father hit him. Later they go to another doctor named Siddharth Parvin Dabas who helps Uttam when he thinks that his house is jail and people poisoned his food because he killed Gandhi. Siddharth eats the food so Uttam knows the food is not poisoned. Later they are in court and a gun expert says that a toy gun  can not kill anyone.
