American Harmony provides an in-depth look at the amazingly rich subculture of a true American art form. It follows the lives of some of the biggest names to emerge from international competition in the Society’s history, as well as providing interviews with many rank-and-file members, referred to as “Joe Barbershoppers.” The film features four prominent Barbershop Society quartets: OC Times, Max Q, Vocal Spectrum, and Reveille – over a span of years, on stage and at home, in their personal quests for international recognition. "The film is a mixture of obsession, singing, zany comedy and nail-biting competition", according to writer/director, Aengus James.  The film was theatrically released in April, 2009, and eventually made its way to 30 markets during 2009/2010. There is a Google pin map showing the markets where the film had a theatrical release.  The DVD was made available in June 2010 through Abramorama, and re-released in September 2011 through Breaking Glass Pictures.
