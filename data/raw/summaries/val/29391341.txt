What Buelent, Murat, Fatos and CiÄŸdem share are memories of their childhood and youth in Germany. Now all of them live in Istanbul, three against their will. Fatos and Murat were forced to go to Turkey by their parents, Buelent was deported five years ago. Only Cigdem, the young manager with a German passport freely opted for a life in Istanbul. But even after decades in their parents country of origin, the other three have never really managed to make it their home. Insteas, they have constructed a surrogate Germany for themselves.
