After being told that his ideas are stupid and make no sense, he decides to move back home and rethink his future. When Gord's father, Jim, questions Gord's life goals, and then proceeds in a fit of rage to destroy Gord's half-pipe, which Gord has spent a whole year building , he subsequently gets even by having his father arrested on falsified charges of sexual molestation, destroying his parents' relationship and his family's reputation in the process.
