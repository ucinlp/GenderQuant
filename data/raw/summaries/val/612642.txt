Shokichi Amamiya  is a difficult 69-year-old man, married to Kikue . He dies suddenly of a heart attack, and it falls to his daughter Chizuko  and son-in-law Wabisuke Inoue  to organize the funeral at their house. Among other things, the family have to choose a coffin, hire a priest, hold a wake, learn formal funeral etiquette and hold the service itself. During the three days of preparation, various tensions within the family are hinted at, such as resentment of a rich but stingy uncle, Inoue's affair with a younger woman, and possibly an affair the dead man himself had with a female croquet player. After the service, the long suffering wife delivers a dignified speech to the family regretting that the hospital would not let her be with her husband as he died.
