The film opens in a plane full of people getting psyched up to try Blood Surfing at some remote island known for its sea surfing locale. A documentary is planned on the blood surfing exploits of Bog  and Jeremy  who is known for extreme sports, with camera operator Cecily  and her boyfriend / producer Zack . As the film progresses Bog develops an interest in Cecily. After arriving the group decides to head to shark rich waters by a remote island, so they contact local guide John  and his girlfriend Arti . John at first refuses to go, but then relents and accepts the job on the condition his sail team come with, including the young Lemmya  who is attracted to Jeremy. The group heads out to the shark zone, despite John being plagued by visions of screaming swimmers being devoured by something in the water. Clumps of meat is thrown in to attract the sharks while Bog and Jeremy suit up, slit their feet, and begin surfing among a group of shark fins. As the cameras roll a shark is eaten by something gigantic and where blood fills the ocean. The group wisely call it a day. The crew goes to the island nearby where Jeremy and Lemmya have sex, as her parents Melba  and Sonny , are devoured in the water, destroying the boat. Lemmya heads to the water to bathe without realizing the danger and is attacked. The remaining crew run for the boat but when they find it wrecked, Bog, Jeremy, Zack and Cecily head underwater for the equipment, where the creature is waiting, while the rest are taken captive by local pirates. Zack attempts to sell Cecily as a slave, but the pirates are attacked by a giant crocodile before the deal can complete. Bog organizes the crew, who now outnumber the pirates, to throw the bandits into the sea, where all but one become crocodile food. The escapee shoots the boat's fuel tank, forcing the survivors to abandon ship. John and Arti, after eventually finding their boat, pick up the remainder moments before the crocodile attacks. In revenge for the deaths, John goes back for the creature. Zack wants to film the killing, but John denies him. In the chaos, Jeremy gets eaten as John beaches the ship on a coral reef while trying to outrun the crocodile. In his panic, Zack surfs away from the wreck, costing him his life while John wires the boat to explode. The crocodile attacks before he can finish, tearing him in half, distracting the creature long enough for the Cecily and Arti to get to an island, where the surviving pirate has been waiting. He knocks out Arti and then tries to rape Cecily. Cecily starts talking dirty saying things like "I want it" to trick him. He gets tired of waiting, runs at her, but gets cut down by a spear trap that John left behind. Cecily, knowing the trap was there, goes to wake Arti. The girls walk further inland and find a temple on the island, with no sign of any predators. The crocodile then attacks them but since they are in freshwater, the crocodile would not go near them. The camera cuts to Bog as he recovers the explosives from the wrecked boat, and makes his way to reunite with Cecily and Arti. He baits the crocodile to an unstable wall and uses the explosives to throw the creature from it. Arti assumes the crocodile is dead and moves closer, but in a swift move it rolls over and devours her. Bog and Cecily run with the crocodile in close pursuit until the creature's heavy weight causes it to trigger an ancient trap that impales its head as the survivors collapse from exhaustion.
