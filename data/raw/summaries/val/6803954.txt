Robins plays bumbling mad scientist Nathaniel Pickman Wingate, of the Miskatonic University. He works on opening a portal to another dimension while his wife, Nancy  and family prepare his fiftieth birthday party. When he succeeds with contact with the new dimension, two creatures escape that look like horseshoe crabs. These creatures can mimic anything and take on the appearance of Nancy's cousin, Count Desmon  of Liechtenstein and Jasmine, a model from son Sam's  poster . Jasmine is friendly and intelligent. Because of her telepathic abilities she quickly becomes Sam's girlfriend. Desmon is ill-behaved and surly. For example, Lindy  overuses the phone, so Desmon stuffs the receiver in her mouth, causing her to go to the ER to have it extracted. Handyman Floyd  is hurt by some cut wires Desmon moves with psychokinesis giving him a severe electric shock. Unable to control his new body, Desmon frightens off the maid Emma  when he tries to seduce her. Reverend Lawrence Newman , Nathan's college roommate, tries some bedroom antics with Nathan's sister, Angelica . Desmon, clinging to the ceiling above them, loses control and causes a dragon spring from his pants. Sam, Jasmine and Sam's best friend, Alex  run to get coolant supplies from the university, which are necessary to prevent an explosion that will destroy half the planet. Jasmine is concerned with doing anything she can to stop Desmon and get back to their own dimension. She spends time, though, with Sam in a '50s-style malt shop, sharing a milkshake with two straws.
