Foh  is a mechanic and part-time racing car driver, playing the Good Samaritan for the police force by helping them to apprehend a dangerous criminal named Cougar  by means of a car chase. The criminal soon breaks free however, and takes revenge on Foh by trashing his business and home and kidnapping his two younger sisters. The only way Foh can free them is by taking part in a race with Cougar a rematch after the criminal's earlier defeat.
