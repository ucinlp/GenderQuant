The film shows a family of French Basque immigrants pioneering into the Wild West while carrying their ancestral vines. Hard drinking trail driver Lon Bennett is hired to lead them and he falls for the spirited Gabrielle Dauphin. The film is infamous among Basques for its misunderstandings of Basque customs, such as the use of the xistera  as a weapon or shouting irrintzi ululations as meaningful communication.{{Citation needed}}
