The story line was loosely based on the Nepalese royal massacre involving Dipendra of Nepal. It was based on the tragedy that struck the family of the Nepal king. Ricky  is an artiste. He happens to see a girl named Devyani  in an accident and falls for her. Subsequently, Devayani also falls in love. As she pretends that she does not love him, Ricky goes abroad. As per Ricky's plan, family members force Devayani to go to Hong Kong, where she meets Ricky. When both of them were enjoying the love, Prince Dipendra of Nepal  meets her and says that he loves her. Later, Devayani and Ricky return to India. Dipendra, who was madly in love with Devayani also comes to India and tells Ricky about his love. Dipendra discloses his identity to Ricky that he was the prince of Nepal. He loves her so much that he killed his entire family in the Nepalese royal massacre for her. When Ricky asks Devayani, she accepts that she was from Nepal and Dipendra loved her, although she never loved Dipendra. Ricky makes several attempts to convince Dipendra that his was a one-sided love and lies to Dipendra that Devayani forgot everything about him in a shock. Then Dipendra again enacts many of the love sequences between him and Devayani, so that Devyani gets back her memory. Devayani decides to commit suicide by jumping off a waterfall. Dipendra tries to save her but in the process he slips off the waterfall. Ricky arrives at the spot and Dipendra somehow manages to climb up the cliff. At this point, four climaxes are shown; the viewers can select any one. In the first climax, Dipendra kills Ricky with his revolver. In the second climax, Dipendra kills Devayani. In the third climax, Dipendra shoots himself with his revolver, having lost his lover to Ricky.

Dipendra spends the rest of his life in Nepal, in Devyani's memory.
