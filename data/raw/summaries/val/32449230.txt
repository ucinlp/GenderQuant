Elisabeth  falls in love with Reinhardt , but he leaves their native village to study music, travel the world and build his career as a composer. His most important compositions are inspired by his love for her, Twelve Songs of Elisabeth and Seerosen , but after she visits him on the day of his final examination at the conservatoire and finds a strange woman asleep in his bed, Elisabeth marries Erich , the wealthy heir to the estate of Immensee. Reinhardt returns to win her back, and Erich releases her, telling her that all that he wants is for her to be happy. This causes Elisabeth to realise what love really means and she tells Erich for the first time that she loves him, and remains with him. In the frame story, many years have passed, Erich is dead and Elisabeth and Reinhardt, who is now a renowned composer, meet for tea at his hotel after a performance of his Seerosen; at the end of the film, she tells him she will remain true to Erich and to Immensee, and he leaves for the last time.Jo Fox, Filming Women in the Third Reich, Oxford/New York: Berg, 2000, ISBN 978-1-85973-391-2, pp. 57, 58, 64.David Stewart Hull, Film in the Third Reich: A Study of the German Cinema, 1933â€“1945, Berkeley, California: University of California, 1969, {{OCLC}}, pp. 216&ndash;17.
