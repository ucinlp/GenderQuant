A ruffian from the Bowery sees a dandy young man approaching him and decides to taunt the well-dressed fellow. The young "dude" ignores the ruffian's insults for a time before losing his patience. He then punches the aggressor in the jaw with a right-handed swing and follows it up with a series of additional blows so that "in less time than it takes to tell  is on his back in the gutter begging for mercy."Plot Summary
