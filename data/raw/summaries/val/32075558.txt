Anthony the Great's devotions in a cave are disrupted by the sudden appearance of a young maiden who he banishes and returns to his prayer book. Two maidens then appear either side of him only to be quickly banished. The saint kisses a skull relic only for it to transform into a third woman, who is rejoined by the others to form encircle him before vanishing. The saint kneels before an image of Christ on the cross only for this to transform into one of the maidens. He is finally saved by the appearance of an angel who returns all to normal.
