But when he blows up a classroom in a chemistry class mishap, he receives a devastating “F” that threatens his ambitions. So Chris strikes a deal with the school’s principal and agrees to spend one Saturday of detention in the woodshop in exchange for wiping the grade from his record. What Chris didn’t count on was having to survive the ex-Army Ranger who runs the woodshop, the eccentric students in class and one kid’s plan to blow them all up.http://www.woodshopmovie.com/aboutthefilm.html
