The movie tells the story of Raj Malhotra , his wife Pooja  and their four sons Ajay , Sanjay , Rohit , and Karan . Raj and Pooja have provided their children with everything they wanted, often at the cost of Raj and Pooja's own requirements. The Malhotras also have an adopted son Alok , who is in love with Arpita  . Alok was an orphan and Raj had provided him with money and education, bringing him up as his own son. Now a successful man, Alok worships Raj because of all his help and thinks him as his own father which he never had. Raj has a flourishing job but, once he retires, he is no longer able to support himself and has to vacate the house he and Pooja have shared for years. They decide to live with their kids to get their love and affection. However, their kids do not want them, as they think looking after their parents will be a hassle. The children decide to split the parents up, each parent going to live with one of the sons for the next 6 months. The story shows how the aged parents endure this separation as well as horrible treatment from their children after all they have sacrificed for them during their lifetime. Saddened by the treatment he has received from his children and their families, Raj writes down all his feelings regarding how he fulfilled all his children's dreams and in return how they treat him, as well as his love for his wife, and how much pain their separation has caused, his writing eventually becoming a novel. While changing their trains after 6 months, Raj and Pooja spend some time together in Mumbai, when they suddenly meet Alok, who takes them to his home and gives them the importance and care which their real sons did not give them. Raj then finds out that his writing has become a published book named Baghban. This book becomes a big hit, selling the first copies immediately. Raj, as a result, gains the money he needs to support himself and Pooja in their old age. It is now that their four sons come back to their parents, asking for their forgiveness. However, they hold an ulterior motive: to get a hold of their parents' money. Raj is honored for his work, and the four sons attend with their wives. When they ask Raj to forgive them, he refuses and instead disowns them. Not even Pooja will forgive her children for the pain they have put them through. Raj stays with Pooja in their home, near Alok and Arpita, and enjoy the company of their grandchildren, Rahul and Payal, while disowning their sons and daughters-in-law.
