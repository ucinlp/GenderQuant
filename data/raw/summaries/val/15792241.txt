Warden Sven 'The Swede' Sorenson  is a malicious warden of the county, illegally executing some of his worst prisoners. Everybody in town hates and is scared of him, except his twin daughters . Swede's twins tell their father they're pregnant, lying so he pushes their dim boyfriends, Bud Dyerson  and Larry , into shotgun marriages. He also turns his sons-in-law into slave laborers, so Bud hatches an escape plan to rob a train carrying old bills to the mint for burning. Larry is his reluctant accomplice. When Bud is captured, he is railroaded into Swede's small-town and dangerous jail by the Judge  and Swede. His death looks certain, until he hatches yet another plan that requires Larry's help. Meanwhile, Judge's Daughter and FBI Agent Karen Polarski , while able to land Bud in federal prison, repeatedly comes to his aid.
