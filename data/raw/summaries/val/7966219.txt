The Mystery, Inc. gang travel to Loch Ness in Scotland to see the famous Blake Castle, the home of Daphne Blake's cousin, Shannon. The Castle grounds is home to the first annual Highland Games, composed of many traditional Scottish sports. But when they arrive Shannon informs them that the Castle had recently been terrorized by the Loch Ness Monster. Shannon says she has seen the monster and it is indeed real, a position shared by Del Chillman, a local Loch Ness Monster enthusiast and amateur cryptozoologist, and Professor Fiona Pembrooke, a scientist who has staked her whole career on proving the monster exists. Taking the opposite end of the argument are Colin and Angus Haggart, and their father, Lachlan, local competitors in the games, and Sir Ian Locksley, the head judge of the games. Locksley and Pembrooke share a mutual hatred for each other. That night, Scooby and Shaggy are chased by the monster, and destroy the playing field in the process. Velma discovers that the monster tracks head into town instead of the loch. The next day, the gang and Shannon travel to town. After enlisting the help of the Haggarty's to rebuild the field, Fred, Daphne, Velma, and Shannon take Professor Pembrooke's boat, filled up with out of date research equipment, to search for the monster by sea, while Shaggy and Scooby take the Mystery Machine and search by land.While Shaggy is distracted, a hand switchs a sign on the road leading to shaggy getting lost.Both groups are attacked by the monster, seemingly being in two places at once. After returning the badly damaged boat back to Prefessor Pembrooke, the gang discovers Sir Ian has taken it upon himself to patrol the waters with a high-tech ship to prevent any further "peculiarities", as he is still not convinced of the monster's existence. On Locksley's ship, the gang and Shannon find something deep in the loch using sonar equipment. They take Locksley's mini-sub to investigate. In the water, the gang is attacked by the monster, but is saved by a large magnet claw on the ship. When they return to Blake Castle, they find Chillman, who explains his van has been stolen. Later, the monster chases the gang, Shannon, and Chillman into a bog, where it is revealed to simply be a canvas covering Chillman’s van. Fred deduces the monster to be a decoy, and sets up a trap to catch the real one. Fred sends Shaggy and Scooby out on the loch to act as bait, while he and Dell prepare to use nets to surround the cove capture the monster. A large fog appears, blocking visual contact with Shaggy and Scooby. Making matters worse, Locksley’s crew mutinies because they want to capture and sell the monster, and capture Daphne and Shannon. The monster attacks Shaggy and Scooby, chasing them out of the cove. Locksley’s ship attaches to the nets, dragging Chillman and Fred with it. The crew attempt to harpoon the monster, but Daphne and Shannon distract them long enough to make them miss. Just as the monster is about to attack Chillman and Fred, Daphne captures it by using the ship’s magnet claw. Just then, a second Loch Ness Monster appears and gives chase to Shaggy and Scooby, but falls into a previously set trap. This monster is revealed to by the Haggart brothers, and the one Daphne captured is revealed to be Professor Pembrooke. Pembrooke used a secret entrance in her boat to go into the monster and operate it. She also hired the Haggart brothers to man the second monster. Velma explains that Pembrooke’s plan was to use her machine to convince Locksley the real monster existed, and enlist his aide in finding it. The next day, the games begin on schedule; But Locksley calls everyone to his ship to look at new pictures of the monster his underwater cameras had taken, taken at a depth well below what a submarine could survive. These, plus other pictures Pembrooke had taken convince him the monster does exist. The film ends with the gang leaving Blake Castle, and Scooby briefly seeing the real Loch Ness Monster.
