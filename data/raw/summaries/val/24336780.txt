As The Great War  begins, 17 year old Jack Kipling , the only son of the famous English writer and poet Rudyard Kipling, declares his intention to join the Royal Navy to fight against the Germans. The elder Kipling , who encourages him in his ambition, arranges several appointments for him to enlist in both the Army and Navy. However, Jack's poor eyesight prevents him from passing the medical examinations, both he and his father are devastated. However, Rudyard uses his influence with the military establishment to eventually secure Jack an officer's commission as a Second Lieutenant in the Irish Guards. Both Jack's mother Carrie , and sister Elsie , disapprove of this post, as they do not wish for him to be deployed to the front line. Jack, who proves to be a popular officer with his troops, undergoes military training and travels to France within six months. On his 18th birthday, Jack receives orders to lead his platoon into action on the following morning. However, during this attack in the Battle of Loos Jack is posted missing in action and the Kipling family is informed by telegram. Over the next two years, Jack's parents track down surviving members from Jack's platoon and interview them. One of Jack's former platoon members eventually confirms that Jack was killed in the Battle of Loos, shot by enemy gunfire, after losing his glasses in the mud during an assault on a German machine-gun post.
