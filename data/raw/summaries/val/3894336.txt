The film is a satire on Indian caste system; when a poor and out-caste, village shoemaker, Dukhi , goes to village Brahmin   to get the date of his daughter's marriage fixed, the Brahmin in turn asks for labour without pay in exchange, the ensuing events however turn the table against the priest, who in the end has to fore-go all the lofty tradition, including that of untouchability, he held so dearly, all this life, in his life as village priest.Overview New York Times.
