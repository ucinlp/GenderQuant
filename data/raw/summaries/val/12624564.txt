Charlie Sorrel is shot and killed by Sir Leopold Sartori  when he is caught fooling around with Sartori's wife. Later, passerby Bruce Minton III  comes to the aid of a dazed woman  wandering on a beach. She doesn't remember much other than directions to Charlie's residence. The next morning, it all comes back to her: she is the reincarnation of Charlie. After getting over the shock, she convinces her best  friend, George Tracy , of her identity. All manner of complications arise as she first accepts the situation and then decides to take advantage of it, with Tracy's reluctant help. Charlie has changed his sex, but he cannot change his ways, and eventually he gets murdered again ... only to be reincarnated one more time: as a dog.
