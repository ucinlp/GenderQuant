The film focuses on Project Nim, a research project that was mounted to determine whether a primate raised in close contact with humans could develop a limited "language" based on American Sign Language. The project was centered on a chimpanzee named Nim Chimpsky. The film also shows that Nim was passed between 3 different teachers, 2 of whom were the project leader's current or ex lovers and raises questions as to how seriously the experiment was performed.
