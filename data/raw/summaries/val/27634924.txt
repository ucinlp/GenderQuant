After being replaced as the chief of police in Paradise, Massachusetts by the town council president's son-in-law, William Butler , Jesse Stone is still without a full-time job . Nevertheless, he continues to find ways to pursue investigations into two separate murders: one involves a friend with whom he had lost contact, and the other has him working as a consulting investigator for the Massachusetts State Police Homicide Division on a case involving a robbery and murder suspect. Both Jesse and his friend, State Police Captain Healy , have doubts as to the robbery/murder suspect's guilt. All the while, Jesse deals with tensions between Butler, who expects him to give up his "concealed carry" gun permit, but who is informed, by Rose Gammon , that as a retired  police officer that he has a federally-mandated right to "concealed carry" for life. His problems with his ex-wife, and drinking issues are still present.
