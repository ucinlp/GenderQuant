High-school student Doug Dawson has it all: a loving family , a terrific girlfriend, a rock band he plays in after school...and a drug habit. The latter costs him everything else, as his behavior becomes increasingly erratic and alienation - some of it mutual - sets in. Doug wanders into an anti-drug lecture by David Toma, playing himself, but Doug is eventually ejected for disruptive behavior. Doug simply does not get the message - until, inevitably, the ultimate tragedy occurs.
