The movie tells the story of a disillusioned television personality whose career has stalled and who is looking for answers but doesn't know the questions. When his best friend taunts him for losing his sense of adventure Tony accepts a drunken Â£100 bet and sets off with his fridge as an unconventional travelling companion. The film recreates Tony's actual 1997 journey around Ireland as he re-evaluated his life and career, found romance, met a wide range of bizarre characters, made many new friends and discovered that people are perfectly prepared to treat a small white domestic appliance as though it was a fully fledged person with a personality in its own right. During the course of the film the fridge is taken surfing, christened, blessed by nuns, accompanied by a bagpiper, taken to a bachelor festival and becomes the hero of a national radio station as Tony and all those he encountered become aware of the power and philosophy of the fridge!
