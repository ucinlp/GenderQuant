Frustrated with his life in a poor Kolkata neighborhood, aspiring rapper Gandu steals money from his mother to finance a trip with his friend Ricksha. The two go off in a heroin-induced haze, finding it increasingly difficult to separate reality from hallucination. The film is shot mostly in black and white stressing on the bleak existence of the protagonist. At the end of the movie, the film shifts to the color mode showing that the character is enjoying the colorful existence induced by the drug he has consumed with his friend. Gandu also ponders on the meaning of life and what we must do with it.
