Alibhai  is the King "Dadha" of Palayam market, Kozhikode. He is the unquestionable hero in that area and savior of the poor and downtrodden. Ganga  and Chenthamara , who sell flowers in the market are crazy about Alibhai, but he has no time for romance because he devotes all his time fighting for the cause of the people. In his past, Alibhai had some bad experiences with his devils Siddique and Aryaman. They wanted to drive out Alibhai from the market and build a shopping mall with the help of local politicians. At one stage, they planted a bomb and killed many of his friends and neighbours. Alibhai got hold of them single-handedly and became the godfather for that area.
