Christin works in a hotel owned by Budcasso, her friend Zidane's fiancé. She is caught embezzling company funds and turns to Zidane for help but Zidane refuses. Christin attempts a fake suicide, hoping that Budcasso would take pity on her, but her plan fails and she really dies. As she was dressed in red when she died, she becomes a vengeful ghost after death and returns to take her revenge. Meanwhile, Budcasso invites his ex-wife Mrs Bud Lung to attend his wedding and Bud develops a rivalry with Zidane. Bud is a traditional Chinese ghostbuster while Zidane has a mastery of Western occult arts, and they become friends after combining forces to subdue Christin. As Budcasso has a phobia of ghosts, he abandons Zidane in the same manner as he did to his ex-wife after seeing that his fiancée is another ghostbuster.
