As Elmer has Bugs Bunny cornered on his hunting trip, Elmer receives a telegram from his Uncle Louie who leaves him $3 million in his will, as long as he doesn't harm any animals, especially rabbits. Bugs, with characteristic Ã©lan, takes full advantage of the situation by moving in with Elmer. Bugs sings "Angel in Disguise", while taking a shower and later shaving and reminds Elmer about Uncle Louie's will. Elmer tries to coax Bugs into leaving, gently patting him on the head, which Bugs claims is hurting him and threatens to call Uncle Louie. Elmer apologises to Bugs then tricks him into walking out of the house. Bugs resorts to faking a serious illness prompting Elmer to take him back in. Later a special delivery letter arrives for Elmer, which inform him that his Uncle Louie died and that he now inherits the $3 million. However, all the of $3 million was deducted to pay for various taxes and Elmer instead inherits $1.98 in debt. Furious at Bugs' torment and intrusion for all that, Elmer chases Bugs round the house until Bugs escapes out the front door. Elmer receives a large easter egg delivery. Upon opening it, several baby Bugs Bunnies who say 'Eh, what's up Doc?' in unison, begin to leap around the house.
