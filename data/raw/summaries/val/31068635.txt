The cartoon starts with an owl named "Owlcott"  starting with a report. This is followed by a Ben Bernie caricature called "Ben Birdie", feuding with "Walter Finchell". The same spoof was used in the cartoon The Coo-Coo Nut Grove : Walter Winchell had a well-publicized feud with Bernie at the time. Afterwards is "Milton Squirrel"  introducing "Wendell Howl"  and an audience trying to figure out which page to go to in their songbooks, which results in Wendell getting pelted by the audience's songbooks. Then, "Billy Goat and "Ernie Bear"  and everyone else sings a song which the words are: :The Woods are full of cuckoos, :Cuckoos, cuckoos, :The Woods are full of cuckoos :and my heart is full of love. During the song, a fox  called "Mr. Allen" is told that he's singing "Swanee River" instead of the actual song. Then the song is sung by "Eddie Gander" , "Sophie Turkey" , "W.C. Fieldmouse" , "Dick Fowl" , "Fats Swallow" , "Deanna Terrapin" , "Irvin S. Frog" , "Fred McFurry" , "Bing Crowsby" , "Al Goatson" , "Ruby Squealer" , and "Lanny Hoss" . Then "Grace Moose"  and "Lily Swans"  sing notes, each note higher than the other. Then, more spoofs are made, including "Louella Possums" , Raven McQuandry , Joe Penguin , Tizzie Fish , Jack Bunny , Mary Livingstone, and Andy Devine . Then Owlcott finishes the cartoon saying "All is well, all is well, all is well..."
