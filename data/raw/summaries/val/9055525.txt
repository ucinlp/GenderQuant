Three colleagues and devoted friends – Danton, Petar and Andrey – share an office and not only on the fifth floor of a socialist industrial research institute from the mid-eighties. Every morning when they come to work they lock the door of the office and, armed with binoculars and great interest, they begin watching the aerobics exercises of a young girl in the nearby building. Suddenly, their tranquil daily round is disturbed - a new director takes over the Institute and decides to develop close scientific partnerships with similar institutes in Japan. A rumor has it that one of our three friends will go on a business trip there. But who? The three friends are now rivals. Homo homini lupus est! All the three undertake sophisticated underground maneuvers in order to get the prize. Everything is at stake! There is only one rule and it is there are NO rules! At the end, of course, it turns out everything has been in vain. The one to go to Japan is the director.Numerous situations filled with humor follow and, at the very end, after the grotesque outcome, we can see the three friends together again. But this time, much wiser… perhaps.
