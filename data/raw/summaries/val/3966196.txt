The clothing department's floor requires renovation; rather than let the staff sit idle while the area is closed off, management sends them on a paid holiday in Spain. Their hotel and its surroundings prove to be dismal, and the group try to pass the time by acting on the crushes they have developed for one another in the workplace. This results in disaster, as multiple amorous notes reach the wrong recipients and everyone gets wrong ideas about who fancies who. Meanwhile the hotel manager receives an unwelcome visit from an old acquaintance, who is plotting a revolutionary uprising and wants to use the hotel as his base. As a result the Grace Brothers staff get a nasty ending to their holiday, narrowly surviving a gunfight between the revolutionaries and federal troops. They are inadvertently saved by a group of tanks that arrive on the scene; these prove to have been commandeered by the store owner from back home, who wanted to visit his beleaguered underlings but couldn't find a taxi.
