William Horatio Ambrose  wants desperately to live up to the proud family tradition; the Ambroses have always been mariners, hence their family motto, Omnes per Mare . In humorous vignettes, Guinness portrays all six, starting with a confused caveman pioneer and ending with his own father's ignominious demise at the Battle of Jutland. Ambrose has a debilitating problem however: he gets violently seasick at the slightest excuse. As a result, his contribution to World War II consists of testing cures for the malady. When he retires from the Royal Navy as a captain, he purchases a dilapidated amusement pier  with his life savings. The workers are an apathetic bunch, led by an insolent Figg , who quits as soon as the new owner begins imposing some semblance of discipline. With the assistance of his new second in command, Tommy ([[Percy Herbert , and much hard work, Ambrose soon has the pier repaired. Then he has to deal with the local town council, headed by the crooked Mayor Crowley  and the hostile Arabella Barrington , who mistakes him for a peeping tom when they first meet. Every time he comes up with an ingenious way to make his business profitable, they see to it that the council outlaws it. When Crowley decides to confiscate and demolish Ambrose's pier and Barrington's bathing huts  to further his own business interests, she resigns from the council and informs Ambrose. He counters by registering his property as a "foreign" naval vessel , under the flag of the easygoing country of Liberama, which puts it outside the town's jurisdiction. He soon attracts many happy, paying passengers for his stationary inaugural "cruise". Thwarted, Crowley hires Figg to take his dredger and demolish the structure late at night. Using a seasickness remedy suggested by Barrington, Ambrose is able to take to sea and foil the scheme , but in the process, part of the pier becomes detached and floats away. He remains aboard to prevent salvagers from claiming it and drifts over to France, where he is hailed as a great naval hero.
