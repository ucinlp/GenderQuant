Dan, an anthropomorphic dog, is in the rear of the arctic "Malibu Saloon" playing pinball. A villain enters and sees Dan's love interest who is referred to by the narrator as "the girl who's known as Sue." Sue, from the villain's perspective, morphs into the image of Bette Davis but tells the villain in the voice  of Katharine Hepburn: "I hope Dan mows you down, really I do." A boxing match ensues during which Dan accuses the villain of cheating; four horseshoes - and a horse - are found in his boxing glove. The fight continues with no outcome and the combatants are given dueling pistols by the narrator. The lights go out, shots are fired and a woman screams . When the lights come on, Dan is seen lying on the floor. His girlfriend says repeatedly, "Say something! Say something!" Dan McFoo wakes up and says "Hewwo!".
