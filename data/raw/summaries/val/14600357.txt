= It is three years prior to the movie events where Shinichi tries to find a witness to confirm a man's alibi for innocence from the murder of his grandmother; apparently he passed out drinking the day he was supposed to meet his grandmother. The clues are a black lab the man saw when he was drunk and the wall which blocks his view. Genta, Ayumi, and Mitsuhiko are shown in Kindergarten but they are too young to confirm the man's alibi. Shinichi solves the case with the help of his father. In the end, he walks down a path with Ran they notice woman starts singing; the song happens to be "Amazing Grace". Conan voices that the song he heard will be important in the case three years from now. Many ties have been made to the OVA, specifically the scene where Shinichi and Ran walk down a path beside a river and forest and hearing a woman singing "Amazing Grace", revealed to be Akiba singing.
