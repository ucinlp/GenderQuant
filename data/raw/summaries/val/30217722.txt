Set in Kerala of the 1950s, Newspaper Boy focuses on the lives of Appu , the young protagonist of the film, and the members of his impoverished family. Appu's father Sankaran Nair  earns a meagre living as a worker in a printing press. He is easily exploited in his work â€” he cannot even muster the courage to ask his employer for overdue wages. Nair's wife, Kalyani Amma , takes care of their three children, Leela , Appu and Balan . Kalyani Amma helps her husband by taking up the job of a housemaid in rich Madhava Menon's  house. She is treated like a slave by Menon's wife Lakshmi Amma . Extreme poverty forces Leela to stop her education. However Nair manages to provide education to Appu, his only hope. Adding oil to the fire, one day, Nair injures his hand during his work in the press. He could not go to work for two-three weeks. The employer fires Nair from the job during this period. He offers Nair the payment for those days, but Nair refuses it, although his family is in dire need of money. Nair tries to find another job but in vain. He cannot even pay the house-rent. House owner Kesavan Pillai  asks Nair either to pay the rent or to leave the house. Soon Nair dies of extreme poverty and illness. After his demise, the family sinks even deeper into poverty. The whole family is now on Appu's shoulders. Appu finds no way to save his family from this situation. Kittummavan , a kind-hearted neighbour, is his only help. Kittummavan asks his son Raghavan  to take Appu to Madras and find him a job. Appu leaves to Madras, where he gets the job as a servant in rich Sreedhara Menon's  house. Menon's wife Kamalamma  behaves brutally to Appu, even worse than Lakshmi Amma behaved to his mother, and he had to leave the job soon. Appu desperately wants to return to his home. He wanders in the street searching for a job to arrange money for his return. He befriends with Pappan , and both of them take small jobs to earn money for Appu's return. Meanwhile, Kalyani Amma, who is suffering from tuberculosis, is thrown out of the house by Kesavan Pillai. Leela and Balan begs for help from Madhavan Nair. He gives them ten rupees and asks them not to come again. Raghavan informs Appu his mother's condition and arranges money for his return. Kalyani Amma dies of illness before Appu reaches. The film ends with Appu taking up the job of a newspaper boy to look after his brother and sister.
