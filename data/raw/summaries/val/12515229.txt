It is Monday morning in the Bronx; two deadbeat punks: Joe Ferrante  and Artie Connors  are causing trouble. After giving a hard time to a pool hall owner for closing early interrupting their game, then briefly harassing a passing couple on the street, then finally mugging an old man for his eight dollars and beating him into unconsciousness, they board the last car of a New York City subway train and psychologically terrorize the passengers who cannot move to another carriage . As they make their way to the nearby elevated station No. 4 IRT Jerome Avenue Line 170th Steet station, we see in flashback the passengers begin to board, starting at the downtown side  of the Bronx Mosholu Parkway where Bill Wilks  and his wife, Helen , with a child boarding the train at approximately 2:15 AM after Bill refuses to take a cab home in Flushing, Queens due to cost. The other passengers board each station sequentially between Mosholu Parkway stop and 170th street: At Bedford Park Boulevard teenage virgin Alice Keenan  and her sexually pushy date Tony Goya ; at Kingsbridge Road an elderly Jewish couple, Sam and Bertha Beckerman . Sam was the second person to really stand up to their tormentors. They tried to get off at the 86th street stop but were prevented by the thugs; at Fordam Road, two soldiers, Pfc. Phillip Carmatti  and Pfc. Felix Teflinger , the latter of whom has a broken arm; at Burnside Ave., a middle-aged wife, Muriel Purvis , who resents her mousey husband, Harry , because he is a teacher who earns less than many of their friends; at the 176th St. station, a recovering alcoholic Douglas McCann , who would be the first to attempt to stand up to the punks; Kenneth Otis , a gay man who earlier made an unsuccessful attempt at befriending McCann and got on at the same station McCann did; and finally an African-American couple who boarded at the Mt. Eden Ave. stop, Arnold and Joan Robinson . They had a chance to get off the train at their stop the 125th Street station at Joan's urging but Arnold, being of a militant bent actually enjoyed the spectacle of white people tormenting each other, and made them stay; and the punk's first victim, an asleep/unconscious derelict  who was on the train always and remains totally oblivious to everything around him during the entire incident, including when the thugs seemed to be trying to set fire to him. Joe is the more aggressive and sociopathic of the two punks, humiliating and degrading the passengers one by one. Artie is passive, docile, and more of a follower. After Joe terrorizes all of the adult train passengers, he is finally challenged when he turns his attention to a young child. Joe gets on his knees and tries to convince the child’s parents to allow him to speak to her directly. The mother and father are frantic and afraid. Joe tries to touch the child. The father holds his child close to his chest in a protective grip while trying to hide her from Joe’s sight. Joe is persistent, causing the desperate parents to keep slapping Joe’s hands away as he tries to touch the child. Only then does Pfc. Teflinger engage and directly challenge Joe with “Stop! Or I’ll put you down!”. This is when Joe pulls out his switchblade knife. Teflinger engages the punk in hand-to-hand combat. Despite his broken arm and a stab wound from Joe's knife, Teflinger manages to overpower Joe, mostly using his cast to beat the man into submission; subsequently, Artie drops his tough-guy facade and cowers when Joe is disarmed and overpowered. The film ends at the 42nd street Grand Central station with the police finally entering the train and, without asking any questions and in reflection of the racial climate of the time, start to arrest the only black man in the car, Arnold who was just standing several feet away from the prone Joe, staring at him. Passengers cry out, “That’s not the guy!” so the cops instead help the almost dead Artie off the floor and out, while a train conductor picks up and helps the other hoodlum off the train. No one bothers to help the wounded heroic Teflinger, except for his scared Army buddy Phillip whose only contribution was to finally yell out for the police which brought them in the first place. Phillip did nothing until it was over when Phillip goes over to an injured Felix. Felix, weakly but disgustedly asked "Where were you buddy?" As Phillip helps him off the train Felix looks at the rest of the passengers who do not even acknowledge any gratitude in subduing the tormentors at the risk of his life. The passengers, still frozen in their seats, are stunned, their personal views of themselves and their companions, if they had any, altered. Only when the sleeping drunk sprawled over the seats rolls over and falls to the floor, do passengers finally awake and slowly exit the train by stepping over the drunk’s unconscious body with Helen Wilks being the last off.
