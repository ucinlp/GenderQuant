Due to a misunderstanding, Yale inadvertently invites the small Texas State University to play their football team for a benefit game. Coincidentally, TSU has just hired a new coach Jack Haley who arrives at the college with his wife  just in time to hear the announcement that the team is to play Yale. The coach digs in to whip the team into shape, but just before the big game, the quarterback breaks his leg. All seems hopeless until they stumble across an Arkansas hillbilly, played by Stuart Erwin, who throws a football like no one they've ever seen. The only problem remaining is to figure a way to get the college to enroll the hillbilly so that he can take the place of the injured quarterback.Pigskin Parade page on The Judy Garland Database, by Jim Johnson
