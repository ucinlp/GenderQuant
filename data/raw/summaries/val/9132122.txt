The film is set in a small industrial town in the Swedish province of VÃ¤rmland, where a young man returns from the big city to investigate the sudden disappearance of his sister. Initially meeting little success with his inquiries, performed through the rekindling of brief acquintances with the very odd characters of an earlier life, he begins to form a picture of what has happened.
