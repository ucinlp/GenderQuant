Fontaine Khaled is the London wife of a wealthy but boring businessman. She spends his money on her nightclub, Hobo, and partying. She hires a manager, Tony, to run her club, but it is understood that his job security is dependent on him satisfying her nymphomaniac demands. Tony loses interest in Fontaine, and turns his attention to her young stepdaughter, who uses him to get back at Fontaine for cheating on her father. Fontaine then dumps Tony. At the end of the film she is divorced by her husband for adultery. The film featured a famous pool orgy scene which was supposed to be set in Paris but was actually filmed in a health club in Covent Garden. In one scene Collins was shown naked on a swing. The film was banned or cut in many countries.
