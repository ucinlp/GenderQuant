Austin Spencer , a newspaper publisher, wants to prove a point about the insufficiency of circumstantial evidence, talks his possible son-in-law Tom Garrett  into a hoax in an attempt to expose the alleged ineptitude of the city's hard-line district attorney. The plan is to have Tom plant clues leading to his arrest for killing a female nightclub dancer, Patty Gray. Once Tom is found guilty, he is to reveal the setup and humiliate the DA. Tom agrees to the plan, not knowing that unforeseen events will put such a snag in the scheme. Spencer dies in a car accident before he can testify, and photographic evidence intended to clear Tom at his trial is burned to an unrecognisable state. Tom is found guilty and placed on death row in prison. A written testimony by the dead man is found in time to demonstrate the veracity of the two men's intentions, and Garrett is to be pardoned. However, a slip about the late woman's unreported real name to his by now former fiance leads him to confess. Gray or rather Emma Blucher, the murder victim, is actually Tom Garrett's estranged wife who had rescinded on her promise to divorce him in Mexico. As this would prevent Garrett from marrying Susan , the late publisher's daughter, he had murdered Emma/Patty. Garrett's potential pardon is rejected in time to prevent the double jeopardy rule coming into effect, and he is returned to the cells.
