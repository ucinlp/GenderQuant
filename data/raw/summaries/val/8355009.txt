The movie features pro-Chávez and anti-Chávez militants, politicians and citizens, within and without the barrios . The anti-Chávez politicians interviewed are members of Primero Justicia. It also examines the nationalization of petroleum. Other Chávez opponents met by the filmmaker come from places like the newspaper El Nacional and the former direction of the petroleum industry. The director did not obtain an interview with the President, but filmed him first hand in speeches and his famous weekly Aló Presidente television show. About the situation of the freedom of the press, director Gervais said that it was easier to film in the Venezuela of Chávez than in Canada.
