Meek high school student Jerry Mitchell  and his kid sister Brei  have the house to themselves as their parents are on vacation. Jerry's day begins badly when he wakes late, and gets worse when he nearly wrecks his car while driving his sister and his girlfriend Franny  to school. When they arrive, the students are preoccupied with talk about new student Buddy Revell , a violent delinquent who has transferred in from an school for at-risk students. Jerry's first hour is at the school newspaper where his best friend, Vincent Costello , is the editor. The teacher has the idea of doing an article about Buddy to welcome the "new kid" and she assigns Jerry to do the interview. In a men's room, Jerry sees Buddy and clumsily attempts to introduce himself and brings up the idea of the article. Through a series of poorly chosen statements, Jerry realizes he is only making Buddy angry and ultimately decides to cut his losses and tells Buddy to "...just forget this whole thing happened", giving Buddy friendly tap on the arm. Buddy, who does not like being touched by others, responds by tossing Jerry against a wall and stating that the two must fight in the parking lot after school at 3 o'clock. With little more than six hours until the encounter, Jerry tries different strategies to avoid the fight. Trying to reason with Buddy in the hallway doesn't work. Vincent suggests that he plant a switchblade in Buddy's locker to get him kicked out of school . Brei advises him to simply skip school, but when Jerry tries to drive away, he finds the switchblade stuck in the steering wheel, and the car ignition wires cut. Trying to run, Jerry is caught by an overzealous school security guard known as "the Duker" , who finds the switchblade and takes Jerry to the office of Mr. Dolinski , the Dean of Discipline. Seeing an otherwise perfectly clean school record, the now suspicious Mr. Dolinski informs Jerry that he will be keeping his eye on him from now on and lets him go. Jerry's other plans for avoiding the fight are equally unsuccessful. Ultimately, Jerry steals money from the school's store, which he manages, and offers the cash to Buddy to call off the fight. Buddy accepts the money, but scornfully calls Jerry "the biggest pussy I ever met in my life." Jerry, seized with self-loathing and anger, decides to confront Buddy and demand his money back. When Buddy refuses, Jerry insists that he is no coward and declares that the fight is on. The fight begins in a parking lot, with hundreds of eager students observing. O'Rourke, The Duker and Franny attempt to stop the fight, but Buddy easily disposes of them. Jerry, though obviously out-matched, still manages to stand his ground and ultimately uses Buddy's brass knuckles to knock out the bully and win the fight. The next day, many students show their appreciation to Jerry for giving them such a great fight , and begin buying individual sheets of paper from the school store for $1 each  to help Jerry make up the lost student store cash. Buddy Revell shows up silencing the bustling crowd and begrudgingly shows respect by returning the $350. The film ends with Jerry replacing Buddy as the new talk of the school, with the rumors having a wide and humorous range of alignment with the truth.
