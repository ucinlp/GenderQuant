A hound dog drives to the hills to dig for gold. However a gas station hound explains that in 1849 there was a major gold rush at San Francisco, CA in the hills at the first sight of gold and he didn't have any success digging, mining or panning any gold. When a horseman reports a sign of gold, the station hound trades his gas station for the other hound's car and equipment.
