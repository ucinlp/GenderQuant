Roxy, a glam-rock star past his prime who has just made a pact with the Devil, goes through much emotional gear shifting when a dozen different writers and directors take control of his destiny and rewrite his life story as they see fit. In his predestined life, Roxy meets a vide variety of colourful characters: women he once loved but has trouble recognizing today; a crooked dealer who keeps leading him astray; a drag queen on the rebound; a failed playwright; a woman barkeep who's interested in Roxy; and, of course, Mephistopheles in all his disguises.
