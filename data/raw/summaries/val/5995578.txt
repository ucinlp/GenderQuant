Comic book fan Les Franken  signs up for an experimental antidepressant. Dr. Dobson  instructs him to take one pill per day. Les creates a diary for his experiences, but feels no results. Les' feelings of reluctance keep him from getting to know Maggie , a quiet girl who works at a grocery store. After several days of taking the pill, Les experiences supernatural powers, beginning with the ability to float. Paying a visit to Dobson, he sees himself floating, but Dobson sees him lying on the floor: Les has no powers at all. He explains that Les is having an adverse psychotic reaction to the drug and orders him to stop taking it. Les instead convinces himself that he has telepathy and Dobson is telling him to continue taking the drug. Gaining self-confidence, Les quits his job in order to become a crime-fighting vigilante, and gains a reputation for tackling people after stopping a gunman from robbing Maggie's store, believing he is picking up telepathic intent to rob stores. He confides his new gifts to best friends Joey  and Everett ([[Robert Baker , who think he's playing when he displays his phasing "power", only to run into a wall. Les tries to join the police, but escapes when he is sought for the assaults. After Dobson learns that Les is still taking the drug and getting worse, he calls on two representatives, Ted  and Jonas , to talk Les out of taking the drugs. Les believes they are there to take his powers away , so his "future self" stabs Jonas in the ear and Les runs off. Les "teleports"  Ted and knocks him out then escapes to join Everett and Joey, who believe "the suits" are nonsense like Les' powers. On the way to Dobson, Les stops a purse snatcher, which astounds his two friends. They go to Dobson, who claims to have never seen Les, but gives the two friends a liquid to flush the medication from Les' body. Les leaves all three and finds that Jonas and Ted have broken into his apartment and are reading through his diary, talking about kidnapping him for a few days for the drug to work its way out of his system. Dobson confesses that Les' reaction could ruin the company if the word got out. Dobson notes that he attempted to recover his career and life, while Les swallows the remaining pills. After Les leaves and makes Ted and Jonas "disappear", the pair beat up Les until he snaps and knocks both out. Realizing that he is losing his mind, he runs to Maggie's store. She reveals she likes him, but does not speak to him because of a stutter; Les admits to liking her and requests to be locked up until the drug leaves his system. Les awakens the following morning to find he cannot float. In his walk home, Jonas runs him down with his car and Ted leaves as Jonas repeatedly hits Les with the automobile, until Les walks off injured, but now with confidence.
