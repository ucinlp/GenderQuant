King Kung Fu tells the story of a good-humored, hat-loving Chinese talking gorilla originally named Jungle Jumper who has been taught karate. After beating up his Kung Fu Master owner Alfunku when the latter dared him to snatch a banana from his hand, he is shipped off to the U.S. as a "goodwill gift" by his battered and embarrassed teacher where he is renamed King Kung Fu for publicity purposes. On the way to the New York Zoo, the "Monster Master of the Martial Arts" is put on display in Wichita, Kansas where two out-of-work reporters set him free with plans to "capture" him and get jobs. Police Captain J.W. Duke  and his patriotic-helmeted little assistant Officer Pilgrim get involved in the city-wide chase along with the phony-looking ape's love interest Rae Fey , Rae Fey is the only one who understands that Fu just wants to see the sights like any other tourist. Her conniving TV journalist boyfriend Bo Burgess (not Beau Bridges as has been listed in some sources, a reference no doubt to the actor's brother Jeff who starred in the first remake of [[King Kong  and his hapless sidekick Herman, a pair of prudish protesters from "OLD HAGS" , and a host of others including cops, cowboys and baseball players partake in a wild chase in order to catch the ape. The gorilla and the girl end up on top of the tallest building in Wichita, a Holiday Inn and homage to the original King Kong film, where the hairy hero makes a final stand involving instances of stop motion animation.
