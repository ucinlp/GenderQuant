With the law after him, and a women's Roller Derby team as well, con man Michael Rangeloff  takes on the lam. He steals a coffin and boards a train, pretending to be a soldier bringing home a comrade's body. In truth, he finds a stolen stash of $5 million in hiding, which everyone wants. The body is meant to be that of Lane Bidlekoff  who actually dodged the draft and is still alive. The film features songs by Supertramp such as Child of Vision and Take the Long Way Home.Finders Keepers soundtrack at IMDB
