In Nazareth, Santa Claus runs away from children as gifts fall from his basket. He's been stabbed and leans against a tree. Neighbors bicker over small stuff. A Palestinian couple meets in a car. More bickering neighbors. A tourist asks an Israeli policeman for directions. Unable to help her himself, the policeman brings out a blindfolded Palestinian prisoner from the back of his van. The Palestinian tells her three different possible routes. The couple is in the car again. The man blows up a red Yasser Arafat balloon and releases it near an Israeli checkpoint. An Israeli soldier is about to shoot it down but his comrade stops him. In the confusion, the couple are able to drive through the checkpoint together. The balloon floats across Jerusalem, eventually settling against the Dome of the Rock. At night, the couple again in a car. The next morning, five Israeli men practice a dance choreography in which they shoot at targets painted with a Palestinian woman. Then, a real female Palestinian ninja like the one on the targets and gets shot at by the men. She gathers all the bullets and returns them. Then a helicopter shows up and she takes it down. The dance choreographer watches helplessly. A man and his mother watch their dinner cook in a pressure cooker.
