The story involves a group of Western expatriates catching wild animals in East Africa and selling them to zoos, led by Sean Mercer . At the outset, Little Wolf , aka "The Indian," is injured during a rhinoceros chase. He is rushed to the hospital at Arusha, where he needs a blood transfusion. None of the team can provide the required rare blood type, but a young Frenchman, Charles "Chips" Maury  can. Chips is hired as a replacement for The Indian as the international group tries to fill all its animal orders for the season. A wildlife photographer, Anna Maria D'Alessandro , arrives to take photos of the animals caught by Mercer's men for a zoo that will be buying the bulk of that season's captures. She is at first mistaken for a man because of the introduction letter she had signed with only her initials. She soon acquires the nickname "Dallas." During her stay, Dallas also becomes known as Mama Tembo  for her efforts to save three baby elephants, culminating in a chase through the streets of Arusha. She also develops a crush on Mercer. There are romantic subplots between the other characters as well.
