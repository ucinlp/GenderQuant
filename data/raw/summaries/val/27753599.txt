The film starts with a hooded man running out of a forest onto a country road. A driver stops for him, removes his hood, and helps the man make a call on his cell phone. The man calls home, and tells his son not to let anyone in, but the boy says 'they're already here, and they shot mum'. In a seemingly unrelated scene, Jaime, his wife Marta, and their daughter Isa have just moved in to a new home. Isa has plans to attend a party with a boyfriend, César. As she prepares for her date, Marta and Jaime are arguing about how to raise their daughter. Before they can settle their argument, three masked men break into their home and take them all hostage. They are Head Thief, Young Thief, and Strong Thief -- three of the men from the moving crew. Head Thief takes Jaime to a bank machine several miles away from home, while the other two stay with mother and daughter. As Jaime begins to withdraw money from every account the family has, tensions are beginning to arise between Young Thief and Strong Thief, back at the house. Strong Thief seems to have no conscience, while Young Thief is more sympathetic to the fate and feelings of Marta and Isa. Head Thief tells Jaime that if there is any deviation from the plan , or if he tries to alert anyone to his predicament, Head Thief will call the house and have the other two invaders kill Marta. Jaime takes the risk, and tries to convince a woman at the bank machine to call the police, but she believes he's trying to rob her, and gives him all her money. This causes Head Thief to call the house and tell Strong Thief to do whatever he wants to Marta. Jaime, hearing Marta's screams over the phone, begs Head Thief to give him another chance. Head Thief agrees, and after telling Strong Thief to leave Marta alone, he takes Jaime to another bank machine further away. Meanwhile, at the house, César comes to pick up Isa for their date. Young Thief and Strong Thief pull him into the house, and find that Marta and Isa have fled to the basement and locked themselves in a back room. The men drag César downstairs and threaten to kill him unless the women open the door. They don't, so Strong Thief shoots César and breaks into the room with a sledgehammer, taking the women hostage again. While guarding the women, Strong Thief has a snack and watches television, cranking up the volume. A policeman comes to the door to say that the neighbours have complained; he asks if he may come in and look around. Young Thief pretends to be Marta's husband, in order to convince the officer that everything is all right. The officer grows suspicious, and Strong Thief slits his throat. Strong Thief decides to rape Isa. Marta offers herself in Isa's place, but Strong Thief laughs and breaks Marta's arm, instead. He takes Isa to a bedroom , while Young Thief tries to make Marta comfortable.. Young Thief, disgusted by the death and pain that's happened so far, pulls Strong Thief off of Isa. The two men fight, and Isa flees deeper into the house. Strong Thief ties up Young Thief and leaves him with a handcuffed Marta, then goes after Isa. When he tries to rape her again, she grabs a statuette and uses it to crush his head. While this is happening, Jaime and Head Thief are in the car, driving around. The idea is for the clock to turn to the next day, so that Jaime can take out more money from the bank. Instead, Jaime speeds up and runs the car into a telephone pole, knocking himself and Head Thief unconscious. When Jaime comes to, he takes Head Thief's gun, then returns home to find Isa in the hallway, covered in Strong Thief's blood. Jaime and Isa go to the basement and release Marta and Young Thief. The three go upstairs. Jaime gives the gun to Marta, then calls the police; while he's on the phone, Head Thief returns to the house and kills him with the sledgehammer. Marta tries to shoot Head Thief, but misses, and is too stunned to chamber the next bullet. Head Thief takes the gun from her and shoots her in the head as Isa watches in horror. Young Thief comes up from the basement, and Head Thief kills him with one shot. Isa falls to her knees and stares at her mother in shock while Head Thief stabs her repeatedly in the stomach.
