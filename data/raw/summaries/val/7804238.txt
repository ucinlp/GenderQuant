The film, a mockumentary that we are meant to believe is real, features around real-life screenwriter Taylor. Taylor is solicited by director Heymann to be the subject in a British television documentary series about British writers working in Hollywood. On the first day of filming this documentary, Taylor is fired from his real-life job as a screenwriter on the dramatic television series Six Feet Under. He is unaware that the documentary crew knows this has occurred. He then relocates to Las Vegas to pursue a dream of becoming a professional showboy . He lies to the documentary crew, purporting to be doing research for a film project. It slowly becomes evident that he is desperate to find a new career, and at the same time he slowly begins to come out of the closet and pursue romance. Showboy went on to win Best Directorial Debut at the British Independent Film Awards and Best Film at the Milan International Film Festival.
