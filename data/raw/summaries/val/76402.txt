In 1949, American attorney and former U.S. Army Air Forces officer Harvey Stovall  is vacationing in Great Britain when he spies a familiar Toby Jug in an English antique shop.In the film, we learn that the Toby Jug that Lieutenant Colonel Stovall found had been used in the Officers Club of the 918th Bomb Group. The Robin Hood-charactered jug which normally faced the wall was turned around to alert the officers that there would be a mission the next day. When the pilots continue to ask about their transfer applications, Savage tries to enlist a young pilot, Medal of Honor-nominee Lieutenant Jesse Bishop  to help him change their attitudes. Bishop eventually comes to believe in the general, and when the Inspector General arrives to check out the unrest, Bishop convinces the others to withdraw their requests. Later, Savage learns that Gately has been hospitalized, having flown three missions with a chipped vertebra that caused him acute pain. This brings about a "rapprochement" between him and Savage. As the air war advances deeper into Germany, missions become longer and riskier, with enemy resistance intensifying. Many of Savage's best men, including Bishop, are shot down or killed. Pritchard tries to get Savage to return to a staff job at VIII Bomber Command. Savage refuses because he feels that the 918th is not quite ready to do without him yet. Reluctantly, Pritchard leaves Savage in command. The first of these missions, aimed at destroying Germany's ball bearing industry, has the Luftwaffe throwing everything available at the bomber force. Although the target is hit, the 918th takes a beating, losing six of 21 B-17s. Savage is shaken when he witnesses Cobb's airplane being blown up by a direct flak hit. Savage concludes that a second strike on the same target is necessary. With the death of Cobb, Savage reinstates Gately as Air Exec. The next day, Savage becomes disoriented and erratic and is unable to haul himself up into his B-17. Gately takes over. Savage becomes nearly catatonic. Only when the bombers return after destroying the target, does he regain his composure. He says a few words, and falls asleep.Although Savage's fate from then on is not clear in the film, in the novel he is promoted and returns to the United States to take command of the Second Air Force. The story then returns to 1949 and Stovall. Stovall returns to his bicycle and pedals away with the Toby Jug.
