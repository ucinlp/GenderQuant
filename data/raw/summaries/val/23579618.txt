In a forerunner of The Dirty Dozen, Marine Gunnery Sergeant McGrath  takes 12 Marines from the brig and trains them to blow up a tunnel behind North Korean lines. McGrath's only friend on the patrol is his Korean guide Pak . Hating their sergeant, the Marines plan to return to their lines without him, seeing that he becomes "a casualty of war". However, en route to their target they find an injured nun  and a group of Korean convent girls whose bus has been destroyed. The Marines change their views when Sgt. McGrath protects the group. When one of their squad  attempts to rape one of the young girls, the brig rats turn against him.p.50 Projansky, Sarah Watching Rape: Film and Television in Post Feminist Culture 2001 NYU Press They proceed with their mission as Marines.
