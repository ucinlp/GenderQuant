The film was inspired by the 1970s heroine blaxploitation films such as Tamara Dobson's Cleopatra Jones , and Pam Grier's Coffy  and Foxy Brown . The title character even had a catchphrase; upon apprehending a criminal, Love would declare, "you're under arrest, Sugah!" The film proved a big success, and consequently spawned a short-lived television series on the ABC network featuring Charles Cioffi as Love's supervisor Matt Reardon and Jack Kelly as Lt. Ryan, the next supervisor. However, the series, financed on a meager budget and heavily sanitized to conform to Graves' religious morals , was eventually cancelled. One episode featured many of Graves' former Laugh-In co-stars such as Judy Carne, Jo Anne Worley and Arte Johnson in particular playing a mad bomber. Another notable guest star was Jaclyn Smith, who appeared in an episode entitled "A Fashion Heist."http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0587416/
