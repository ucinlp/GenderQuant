The story follows the fortunes of Simon Sparrow , starting as a new medical student at the fictional St Swithin's Hospital in London. His five years of student life, involving drinking, dating women, and falling foul of the rigid hospital authorities, provide many humorous incidents. When he has to leave his first choice of lodgings to get away from his landlady's amorous daughter , he ends up with three amiable but less-than-shining fellow students as flatmates: *Richard Grimsdyke . A relative had left him a small but adequate annuity while he remains in medical school, so he sees to it that he flunks each year. *Tony Benskin , an inveterate woman chaser. *Taffy Evans , a rugby fanatic. Towering over them all is the short-tempered, demanding chief surgeon, Sir Lancelot Spratt , who strikes terror into everyone. Simon's friends cajole him into a series of disastrous dates, first with a placidly uninterested "Rigor Mortis" , then with Isobel , a woman with very expensive tastes, and finally with Joy , a nurse at St Swithin's. After a rocky start, he finds he likes Joy a great deal. Meanwhile, Richard is given an ultimatum by his fiancée Stella  – graduate or she will leave him. He buckles down. The climax of the film is a rugby match with a rival medical school during Simon's fifth and final year. After St Swithin's wins, the other side tries to steal the school mascot, a stuffed gorilla, resulting in a riot and car chase through the streets of London. Simon and his friends are almost expelled for their part in this by the humourless Dean of St Swithin's . When Simon helps Joy sneak into the nurses' residence after curfew, he accidentally falls through a skylight. This second incident gets him expelled, even though he is a short time away from completing his finals. Sir Lancelot, however, has fond memories of his own student days, particularly of the Dean's own youthful indiscretion . His discreet blackmail gets Simon reinstated. In the end, Richard fails , but Stella decides to enroll at St Swithin's herself so there will be at least one doctor in the family. Simon and Taffy graduate.
