Sean Vetter  and Demetrius Hicks , who are former criminals, are members of the U.S. DEA working on the California/Mexico border. After arresting a drug baron named Memo Lucero , the mysterious "Diablo" steps in and organizes the assassination of Vetter, but his wife, Stacy , is the one who is killed instead. Looking for revenge, Vetter acts outside the law to punish his wife's murderers. To accomplish that, he asks Memo, who is now in prison, for help finding Diablo. With Hicks' help, he hunts every member of the cartel from the bottom to the top of the organization's hierarchy and finds that Memo is linked to the recent activities.
