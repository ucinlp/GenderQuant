Yuko Moriguchi , a junior high teacher and single mother, announces she will resign. She reveals that her daughter, Manami, was killed by two pupils in her class, whom she dubs "Student A" and "Student B". Her disclosure of their behavior soon reveals their identities, but she recognizes that they will escape punishment as legal minors. Instead, she admits to injecting her dead husband's HIV contaminated blood into the milk cartons that the murderers have just drank from. The rest of the film describes the aftermath of this event in a series of first-person narratives from the two students, Moriguchi, and others. An enthusiastic new teacher is appointed, unaware of the class's dark secret. Student A, Shuya Watanabe, continues to attend school but student B, Naoki Shimomura, has developed psychiatric problems. It is revealed that Shuya, who planned the murder, did not actually kill Manami by electrocution; instead she drowned because Naoki threw her into the pool. Naoki is worried that he will soon die from AIDS and refuses to clean himself, as he equated the smell of unwashed hair and body odor to being alive. His mother tries to help but fails as Naoki reacts violently to any physical contact and shuts himself in his room. It is revealed later that Naoki killed Manami on purpose, as a gesture to validate himself in the eyes of Shuya, whom he considered his only friend. His mother eventually realizes that her once good and kind son has transformed into an unknown monster. Seeing no hope, she decides to end both their lives, but in the ensuing struggle only she is killed and Naoki is arrested by the police. Shuya describes how his mother abused and finally abandoned him when he was young, because she was unhappy with the role of a house wife, and chose instead to pursue her scientific ambitions. He wants to prove himself to her and to earn her attention, which evolved from clever little inventions to gruesome recordings of him killing and dissecting animals. His first public invention, an electric anti-mugger wallet, earns him a science fair award but fails to make the headlines because of the sensational "Lunacy murder" that occurs on the same day. He decides to kill someone so that he can become front page news, which led to the incident with Moriguchi's daughter Manami. After the incident, Shuya befriends Mizuki Kitahara when they are forced to kiss by the rest of the class, as part of their escalating bullying tactics against him. Mizuki discovers that Moriguchi had lied about the blood-contaminated milk, realizing that it was an implausible method of transmission to begin with and that someone so concerned with the value of life would not do such a thing in the first place. Mizuki begins to develop feelings for Shuya, revealing to him a side of herself she'd never shown to anyone else: namely, that she identifies with the teenage girl who poisoned her parents in the Lunacy murder as her "other self." Shuya starts a relationship with her to distract him from his own problems, but when Mizuki eventually confronts him for harboring an Oedipus Complex, Shuya angrily claims that she is afraid of death, killing her and hiding the body in a refrigerator. Shuya goes to visit his mother but discovers that she has remarried, and believing she has forgotten him, he plants a bomb in the hopes of killing himself and his classmates at their graduation ceremony where he is due to read an award-winning essay entitled "Life". However, the bomb does not go off and is revealed to be missing; he then receives a call from Moriguchi telling him that, after previously being tipped off by Mizuki, she had moved the bomb to his mother's office, making it so that he kills her instead. Moriguchi appears at the end, and tells Shuya, humiliated and overcome, that this was her revenge, and that his redemption now begins. She then adds "just kidding", referencing what Shuya told her when he confessed that he killed her daughter.
