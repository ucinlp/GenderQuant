Unlike the previous installments in the satirical trilogy, Episode III tells a more cohesive chronological tale stretching from before the events of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace to after Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. Emperor Palpatine, voiced by Seth MacFarlane, acts as a narrator - chronicling his own rise to power, the questionable wisdom of his selection of Anakin Skywalker as an apprentice, the extermination of the Jedi, and routine life aboard the Death Star. Several skits feature Boba Fett, voiced by Breckin Meyer , including his fall into and time spent in the Sarlacc pit. Other skits feature more minor characters like Gary the Stormtrooper, Max Rebo, Yarael Poof, and Prune Face - none of whom had speaking roles in any of the Star Wars films.
