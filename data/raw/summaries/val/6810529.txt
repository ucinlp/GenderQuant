The mysterious Michael Rimmer  appears at a small and ailing British advertising agency, where the employees assume he is working on a time and motion study. However, he quickly begins to assert a de facto authority over the firm’s mostly ineffectual staff and soon acquires control of the business from the incompetent boss Ferret . Rimmer then succeeds in establishing the newly invigorated firm as the country’s leading polling agency, and begins to make regular TV appearances as a polling expert. He subsequently moves into politics, acting as an adviser to the leader of the Tory opposition, and then becomes an MP himself, for the constituency of Budleigh Moor , along the way acquiring a trophy wife . Relying on a combination of charisma and deception--and murder--he then rapidly works his way up the political ladder to become prime minister , and finally, by public demand, a near-dictatorial president. Ferret attempts an assassination from a window when Rimmer and his wife's opened topped car is in a passing motorcade - but fails. The film satirised the growing influence of PR, spin and opinion polls in British politics,<ref namehttp://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2007/jun/30/television.comedy|titleCook|first30 June 2007|publisher2009-10-14}} as well as parodying political figures of the time such as Harold Wilson and Enoch Powell. Peter Cook admitted later that he had partly based his portrayal of the Rimmer character on David Frost, who had provided funding for the film<ref nameThompson|firstPeter Cook: A Biography|publisher1997|pages0-340-64969-0}} and took an executive producer credit. Latterly, the film has acquired a fresh contemporary relevance in that Michael Rimmer's character and career seem eerily predictive of Tony Blair .
