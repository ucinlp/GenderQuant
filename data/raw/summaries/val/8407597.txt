The story begins with Jack summing up resent events leading up to the start of the story:{{cquote}} Daffy trades his cow and is hornswoggled with a trade of three beans. Subsequently he tosses out the beans and they land right into Bugs Bunnyâ€™s rabbit hole. A beanstalk erupts shortly after, and Jack decides to climb it. During his climb, he meets Bugs who is in bed, and kicks him away. Realising his situation, Bugs decides to tag along. Meanwhile, Jack reaches the top of beanstalk, excited about stealing the fortune that the giant's castle holds, until he meets the giant himself. Jack's excitement turns into panic and he runs from the giant just as Bugs reaches the top. As the giant closes in on the duo, Bugs tells the giant to get Jack instead, after that's whom he is originally after. Jack frantically tries to pass this off as a lie, declaring his name to be Aloysius, and that Bugs is Jack . As the two start to argue of who the real Jack is, the giant decides to "open with a pair of Jacks" and capture both of them and takes them to his castle, where he traps Bugs and Jack under a glass cake dome to prepare to grind their bones to make some bread. However, they manage to escape because Bugs has an ACME glass cutter in his possession. The giant then continues to chase the two around his castle as they are trying to escape. The chase continues until Bugs manages to trip the giant, knocking him unconscious. Bugs wants to go home, but the greedy Jack decides to stay so he can steal from the giant. As Bugs is running towards the beanstalk, he comes across the giant's equally large carrot garden ready to be eaten. Later that night, as a very full Bugs rests under one of the giant carrots he has been eating, he wonders what has become of Jack, who is trapped inside the giant's pocket watch, acting like the minute and hour hands, while constantly making tick tock sounds.
