;Loneliness  A young woman, stuck in her apartment due to the cast on her leg, communicates with the outside world via cell phone and text messages. She complained to her boyfriend, Puak, who went on a camp trip in Chiang Mai, that she felt so lonely. Every night she exchanges text messages with a stranger, who asked to befriend her and seems friendly enough, and there’s no reason for her to read between the lines when he mentions that he is currently dwelling somewhere “cramped.” After sending the mysterious stranger her picture, she asks for one in return and is sent the same picture. When she questions him, he says he is in the picture next to her. A ghostly face is slightly visible next to her smiling face. As she researches recent deaths she discovers that the son of Princess Sophia of Virnistan died and was buried with a cellphone. She then gets a text saying that he will come to her place now. All of the lights begin to go out and the young woman cries in fear. She is then assaulted by the ghost and is thrown out of the window to her death. We are then shown a scene from the past where the prince receives a text message from his girlfriend ending the relationship which makes him walk in front of a taxi cab causing an accident, same accident that was the cause of the main character's broken leg as she was inside the cab. ;Deadly Charm  A nerdy student named Ngid saw his school friends take some drugs, and he was beaten to death.
