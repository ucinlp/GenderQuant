The film loosely follows the central plot of Fleming's novel. British secret agent James Brum infiltrates the Pub Royale where he beats opponent Le Dough at a high-stakes monopoly game. Escaping from Le Dough's beautiful mistress Lenya, Brum gives chase to Le Dough on a modified bicycle to rescue love-interest Lambretta. In the climax Brum sellotapes live hedgehogs to the road which puncture the tyres of Le Dough's sports car and it hurtles over a cliff.
