Margaret Garrison is a stage actress who has spent her career starring in virginal roles, although she would relish the opportunity to play someone less savory, such as an Italian prostitute, at least once before she retires. When a blackout shutters her current Broadway play for the night, she returns home unexpectedly and discovers her architect husband Peter being overly attentive to attractive reporter Roberta Lane. Infuriated, she heads to the couple's weekend house in Connecticut and takes a potion to fall asleep. When embezzler Waldo Zane develops car trouble near Margaret's home, he sneaks in, unwittingly takes some of the elixir himself, and falls into a deep sleep beside her. Peter shows up, assumes his wife has been unfaithful, and heads back to Manhattan. Margaret's agent Ladislaus Walichek, anxious because she has announced her plan to retire, keeps her husband's jealousy burning in the hope their marriage will crumble and she'll be forced to continue working to support herself. Margaret and Peter eventually reconcile, but new questions about what really happened when the lights went out arise when she gives birth exactly nine months after that fateful night.
