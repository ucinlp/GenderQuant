Twenty three years after the original, documentarist Melvin Hall  interviews mainstream artists, actors, and musicians about the days of the popular band The Rutles, though mostly ending up in the wrong country. The film ends with Melvin and the interviewees laughing. In the interviews with David Bowie, he is seen holding a copy of the vinyl album The Rutles 1, calling it a "piece of marketing extravagance". The interview in the film shows the cover of the album with a black circle that has the words "27 No. 1 Songs On One LP". In the DVD extras, the circle on the album cover says "27 No. 1 Songs On 1 CD", even though this is a vinyl record album. Either way, this was the only time that a Rutles album was practically identical to a Beatles album in both album cover and title. The plot remains the same to its 1978 counterpart, with a new introduction and conclusion with Idle's character, Melvin Hall.
