Lily Krenshka is arrested for soliciting drinks and told to leave town. A photographer, Max West, offers to pay her for swimsuit poses, but she also learns the art of photography from him and sets out for New York to start a new career, changing her name to Lila Crane. A chance meeting with reporter Russ Bassett leads to an introduction to nightclub owner Les Bauer, who lets Lily take pictures at the club. A newspaper columnist pays her for candid shots of important guests, including gangster Horace Sutherland and his mistress. When high-society maven Mrs. Payton Grange permits a rare photo to be taken, Lily's exclusive makes a name for herself as a photographer. She becomes well-known and well-paid, even resisting Russ's offer to find her a steady, respectable job with his employer. She's so busy, she brings in Max to be her assistant. Lily gets caught in a feud between Sutherland and a rival crime boss and ends up with an incriminating picture that she tries to sell for $25,000. She ends up kidnapped and held captive in a warehouse, with Russ her one and only chance for a rescue and a fresh start.
