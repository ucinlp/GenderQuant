The show opens with Larry the Cucumber driving onto the countertop in a brand-new "Soo-Vee Action Jeep", which Larry has been wanting for a long time. Though Bob the Tomato thinks that Larry's now happy, the cucumber admits that he won't be happy until he has all the additional vehicles in the Soo-Vee line. Bob sees Larry's problem as a good theme for the episode. The French Peas Jean-Claude and Philippe then appear and segue the theme into their own story. The story introduces Madame Blueberry, a rich but perpetually "blue" woman who lives in a sparsely-decorated treehouse. Though her butlers  attend to her every whim, they find themselves unable to lift Blueberry out of her doldrums. The only happiness she seems to get is from looking at photographs of all the amazing possessions her neighbors own, which she keeps in various photo frames. One day, a trio of salesmen  arrive at Blueberry's treehouse to promote their new "Stuff-Mart," a department store, under the claim that they've got anything and everything she needs to be happy. Though Bob has his doubts, Blueberry goes along with the sales pitch and follows them to Stuff-Mart. Madame Blueberry and her butlers follow the salesmen to the Stuff-Mart. Along the way, she sees a poor, but, happy girl celebrating her birthday with her parents who could only afford 1 piece of pie for her birthday dinner. Blueberry wonders why the girl is happy even with so little. She goes on and buys 1 of everything she sees in the store . She gets so many stuff that she accepts an offer to continue shopping while the stuff was delivered to her house. Loads of carts go out the door to her home for deliveries . During a lunch break, she sees Junior Asparagus being happy with his dad buying a ball for him at the "Stuff Mart," despite his disappointment over learning that his dad couldn't afford the train set he really wanted. Blueberry wonders how come the boy was happy even though he wasn't getting the 1 thing he really wanted and why she wasn't happy even though she was getting the many things she wanted. The Scallions return to her to take her to see toaster ovens. Seeing that she already had a wonderful home and two loyal friends in her butlers, Blueberry realizes her folly in not being thankful for what she had and tells the salesmen that she is done giving in to their materialistic temptations. When she leaves the Stuff-Mart, however, Blueberry sees her tree tipping over due to all the stuff inside her house weighing it down. Grabbing a shopping cart, Blueberry tries to catch up to the delivery peas, but is unable to stop the final delivery, a giant air compressor, from arriving at her house. The final heavy object proves to be too much for the poor tree house to handle: the back door forces itself open and dumps every one of Blueberry's purchases into the lake below. In turn, the sudden loss of weight causes the tree to fling Blueberry's house out of its branches, over the forest, and onto the ground, where it immediately collapses into a wreck. As the story draws to a close, Blueberry is with her butlers, the birthday girl, Junior, and their respective parents. Though homeless at the moment, Blueberry nonetheless is finally happy for having such caring people be with her. At last, the blue berry has understood that "a thankful heart is a happy heart".
