One after another of a company of carrier pigeons fall prey to the seductive wiles of "Queen of the Spies" Hatta Mari. The alarm is raised at pigeon headquarters when Pigeon 13  goes AWOL with the female Nazi spy bird, to whom he reveals all his secrets . In shame, Pigeon 13 departs to commit suicide, although after an offscreen gunshot is heard, he briefly returns to note "Duh, I missed." Later, self-described woman-hater Daffy volunteers for the next mission. Hatta tries to seduce him by hiking up her skirt to reveal her shapely leg and kissing him full on the lips twice. The first kiss electrocutes Daffy and melts him like butter, but the second kiss electrocutes Hatta Mari having the same effect on her. Daffy ultimately resists her charms but swallows his secret message when the temptress corners him. After a frenetic battle, she x-rays Daffy and broadcasts the supposed secret  to Hitler himself. Outraged, Hitler declares "Dot iss no military zecret!" Goebbels and Goering concur -- "Ja. Efferybody knows dot!" -- then shoot themselves in the heads after receiving Hitler's angry glare.
