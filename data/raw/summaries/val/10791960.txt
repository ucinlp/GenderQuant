Vijayan, the Inspector and Rajini a thief are brothers who get separated in childhood. When they meet in a strange situation Vijayan is thrown out of the train and Rajini lands in the village as inspector and events following that is the story. Rathi who performs dance in the street helps Rajini and steals his heart. Ilaiyaraja had lot to do with the background score and had some good chance to prove in the dance sequences for Rathi. Two notable songs being the romantic love duet between Rajinikanth and Rathi and the other one is a typical dance number for Rathi. Both the extreme situations well handled by Ilaiyaraaja and aptly written lyrics by Vaali. Vaali - as usual takes up simple words with village naivety and carves a neat poem out of that which takes the shape of kaathodu poo urasa. The film played for 20 weeks grossing over $100,000 at the box office.
