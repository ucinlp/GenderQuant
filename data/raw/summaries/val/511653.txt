The film features three primary sets of characters, each within their own distinct story: * A young man (Matsumoto, played by [[Hidetoshi Nishijima  who rejects his engagement to his fiancée  to marry the daughter of his company's president. When his former fiancée attempts suicide and ends up in a semi-vegetative state, he takes her out of the hospital and they run away. * Another young man  is obsessed with the pop-star Haruna ; he blinds himself when she is involved in a disfiguring car accident. * An aged yakuza , who tries to meet a girlfriend from his youth . These stories do have some incidental visual cross-over with each other in the film, but are mostly separate. The first story is the one the film centers on. The film leads into it by opening with a performance of Bunraku theatre, and closes with a shot of dolls from the same. The performance is that of "The Courier for Hell" by Chikamatsu Monzaemon, and it alludes to themes that reappear later in the film. Because the rest of the film itself  can be treated as Bunraku in film form, the film is quite symbolic. In some cases, it is not clear whether a particular scene is meant to be taken literally. The film is also not in strict chronological order, but there is a strong visual emphasis on the changing of the seasons and the bonds of love over the progression of time .
