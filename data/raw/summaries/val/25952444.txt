Ma and Pa come home after their fun and exciting trip to New York City. Only to find out that they're going to be grandparents. Kim is expecting a child. As Tom worries the whole Kettle house is happy with the family's newest addition. Right in the middle of breakfast the Kettles receive a telegram delivered by Alvin, the Western Union delivery boy, from Jonathan and Elizabeth Parker  declaring that they are coming to see the newborn! Ma hushes everybody, but to her surprise the in-laws have just come and are oustside. Ma goes to greet them but the Kettle children try to help by fighting over who gets to take their luggage in. The Parkers are refined Bostonians and their first impression of the Kettles leaves them in an awe. Ma and Elizabeth don't get acquainted very well - the reason why the Kettles leave their ultra-modern house to their beloved ramshackle farmhouse!
