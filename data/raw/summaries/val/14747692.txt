Aging prizefighters and longtime pals Cesar Dominguez  and Vince Boudreau  always regretted not getting one last shot. Out of the blue, such an opportunity comes their way â€” except it is to fight each other. Boxing promoter Joe Domino  has a problem on his hands. The fighters scheduled to be on his undercard in Vegas, a preliminary to a main event featuring heavyweight Mike Tyson, suddenly become unavailable at the last minute. He needs replacements fast, so a call is made to a gym in Los Angeles to see if Dominguez and Boudreau would be willing to step into the ring against one another. The boxers negotiate one condition: that the winner will be given a chance to fight for the middleweight championship. Domino agrees, although the untrustworthy promoter is not necessarily a man of his word. Cesar and Vince have only a day to get to the fight. They decide to drive rather than fly, so they call upon their friend Grace  to drive them in her lime green Oldsmobile 442. Grace is a former love interest of both. Grace's own plan is to pitch her various money-making ideas to Vegas bigshots like hotel and casino boss Hank Goody  and raise venture capital. Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker  whose insults finally result in Grace's flattening her with a solid right cross worthy of her traveling companions. The fight between the two friends is sparsely attended, ringside fans and celebrities remaining uninterested until the night's main event. Cesar and Vince mix it up so savagely, however, beating each other to a bloody pulp, that fans in the arena begin paying more and more attention, as do commentators on TV. When the action-packed and dramatic bout comes to an end, Cesar and Vince are paid off, but promptly spend most of their money in the casino. Grace, too, comes away bruised and empty-handed, except for her everlasting relationship between a couple of hard-headed but soft-hearted guys.
