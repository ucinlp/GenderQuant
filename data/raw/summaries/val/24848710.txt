Aris, 27 years old, returns home after a long absence. His mother, a rich, eccentric and lonely woman lives with her secretary, Sylvia and her loyal gardener Christos, who is mute, in a house famous both for its view in Acropolis and for its swimming pool, supposed to be the deepest in Europe. As Aris falls in love with a poor girl, Alexandra, and confronts his past, a wild fire threatens Athens.
