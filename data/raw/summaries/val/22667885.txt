Geremia, an aging tailor/money lender, is a repulsive, mean, stingy man who lives in his shabby house with his scornful, bedridden mother. He has a morbid, obsessive relationship with money and he uses it to insinuate himself into other people's affairs, pretending to be the "family friend". One day he is asked by a man to lend him money for the wedding of Rosalba, his daughter. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0772105/ The Internet Movie Database
