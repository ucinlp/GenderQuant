Jesus Shuttlesworth , an extremely talented high school basketball player from Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York is being pursued by the top college programs in the nation. His father, Jake , is a convicted felon serving time at Attica Correctional Facility for accidentally killing his wife  by pushing her while arguing with Jesus at the age of 12. The father is temporarily released by the governor, an influential alum of "Big State", one of the colleges Jesus is considering, so that he might direct his son to sign with the governor's college in return for an early release.
