{{expand section}} Based on strange events believed by many locals to have taken place in Chiang Mai late last century, the story opens with 40-ish marketer named Thee , his wife Parn , his rebellious teenage daughter Nan  and lively young son Nat  moving from Bangkok to Laddaland, an upmarket housing estate located in Chiangmai. Convinced that his new job with a company that sells dietary supplements is the answer to all his troubles, Thee ignores Parn's legitimate concern over hefty mortgage payments; he also believes that the move will lift Nan's deep-seated resentment of him and Parn, who left the girl with her grandmother for much of her childhood. Following the grisly murder of a Burmese housemaid and Thee's unpleasant encounter with wife-beating next-door neighbour Somkiat , ghosts start appearing before Nan, who is unable to convince her parents that she's not making up these supernatural incidents. Thee mistakenly shoots Nat, and believing that he had killed his son, shoot himself. Parn, Nat and Nan leave the Laddaland following this incident.
