{{See also}} Nickelodeon's first original computer-animated Nicktoon is about Fanboy and Chum Chum, two energetic super fans of science fiction and fantasy, who live in the Fanlair, a water tower in the sleepy, colorful town of Galaxy Hills. Their indomitable zeal for life is rewarded with comic adventures and misadventures fueled by their fertile imaginations, short attention spans, and madcap worldview. They wear their underwear on the outside of their costumes the way many superheroes do, including their idol Man-Arctica.
