The movie is presented as two parts of a double feature, the titles being Tonya: The Battle of Wounded Knee and He Never Gave Me Orgasm: The Lenora Babbitt Story.  Figure skater Tonya Hardly , desperate to win the gold medal in the Olympics, tries to eliminate competitor Nancy Cardigan  by hiring someone to injure her; although she only suffers a small bruise. The news story is so tragic and heart-wrenching that all of Tonya's co-conspirators turn themselves in and finger her. Sailing above the scandal, she goes on to compete at the 1994 Winter Olympics, but is undone by her lack of talent and undersized panties.  Lenora Babbitt , having been recently pardoned for her crimes, tells Dick Langley  about the events that had led up to her arrest: She had cut off the penis of her drunken husband, Juan Wayne Babbitt , because he couldn't satisfy her sexually. After it was devoured by a dog, Dr. Kelloc  was able to transplant one from a deceased biker. However, Lenora learns that the biker's widow  now has "visitation rights" to it; thus, when she and Juan perform a re-enactment of the incident on TV, she actually cuts off his new one. He ends up becoming a transsexual, saying on talk shows that he now understands how hard it is to be a woman.  The movie includes animated sequences in which Tonya and Lenora are watching the picture at a drive-in theater. They arrive together in a car at the beginning, Tonya cheers after the first feature, and the two grinning women drive off at the end.
