{{listen}} Carey's performance was recorded on March 16, 1992 at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York.<ref name72}} The show featured a number of musicians, back-up vocalists and just a crew of ten, for filming and recording. It was directed by Larry Jordan, who had previously worked with Carey on the music video for "Someday". The show began with the song "Emotions" ; Carey entered the studio dressed in a black jacket and matching pants and boots. The show's rhythm section was led by Gigi Conway on the drums, Randy Jackson on bass, Vernon Black on guitar, and Sammy Figueroa and Ren Klyce, both percussionists. Additionally, Carey had ten background singers on stage, led by Trey Lorenz and Patrique McMillan.{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p"nickson4"/> They had been present during Carey's live performance of the song on Saturday Night Live a few months prior. As Carey introduced the song, she said "this next song I wrote with one of my idols, Carole King", beginning the performance shortly after.{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p"nickson5"/> She later explained to the audience that it would help her in hearing herself more precisely, something needed to properly execute a higher ranged note.{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p"nickson6"/> Prior to beginning the fifth song on the set-list, "Make It Happen" , Afanasieff shared the organ with Cole, playing the bass while the latter handled the treble. He felt the song was superior to the studio version, due to its stripped performance and vocals:  "The roughness of this version succeeded in a way the recorded version on 'Emotions' could never manage. In the sterile atmosphere of a studio, where perfection, technology, and overdubbing were the rules, spontaneity had no place. On the stage, it was valued, and this performance had it. Everyone pushed everyone just a little further, to create something wonderful, and judging by the response, the audience realized it, as did Mariah when the song was finished."{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p"nickson7"/> Several days after the concert, Carey sat down with Melinda Newman from Billboard, telling her of the experience recording the show, as well as her view on it from a creative perspective.
