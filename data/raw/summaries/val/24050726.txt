Lum and Abner, from their radio show, have a General Store, which is the centre of life in Pineridge, Arkansas. The store also serves as the town's post office, where Alice is working as post-mistress. She is in love with the local doctor's son Kenneth. They’d marry; but, her Aunt’s feud with Doc, puts all kinds of stumbling blocks, in their way. Kenneth is working as a doctor in the next town; but, doesn’t make enough to support a wife and their younger brother; so, they have to wait. When the town drunk is made Deputy Sherriff, after the death of his daughter, it seems like tragedy, may turn to comedy; and, maybe, a happy ending, after all.
