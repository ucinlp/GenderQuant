The story is set around 1580, in the time of King Akbar. Biramdev is the king of Medta, a province in Rajasthan. He has 2 daughters, Meera and Krishna and a son, Jaimal. Meera is in deep emotional love with Lord Krishna, so much so that she consider Lord Krishna to be her husband. Akbar is becoming stronger day by day and hence other small provinces are trying to join against Akbar. Medta, in one such political agreement, decides to join hands with Raja Vikramajit . As a part of this agreement Meera is married  to Vikramajit's son, Rana Bhojraj. But even after getting married her love for Lord Krishna remains the same and she follows her own ideals and way of living which are not very acceptable to Bhojraj and his family. One thing leads to another and one day Meera is declared as an outcast and traitor who failed to play a wife's duties towards her husband, a bride's duties towards her family, and a woman's duties towards society. She is jailed and a public trial is ordered to decide her fate. But Meera is still unshakable and her spirituality keeps her going. She is not even afraid of death. Finally, she is given a death sentence and ordered to publicly drink a cup of poison.
