Tommy Tanner and Egbert G. Higginbotham are two vaudevillians who were kicked out of the last town they performed in. After fleeing to the town of Lockville, the duo befriend elderly widow Mother Talley. Mother is upset because she is unable to get customers into her drug store. In addition, Mother owes a payment on a bank note to Harry Watters. Tommy and Egbert decide to turn Mother's drugstore into a money-making venture, even producing their own afternoon radio program right in the store. Harry, who wants to buy the store as part of a bootlegging operation, attempts to sell the duo an alcohol-laced drink, referring to it as "lemon-syrup". The "syrup" gains praise from everybody in town, until the police show up to close down the operation. Tommy and Egbert are suspicious of Harry, and it's up to them to find Harry, clear their name, and save Mother's store.
