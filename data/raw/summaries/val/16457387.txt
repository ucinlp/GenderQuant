Set in the Edwardian era music halls of London, the popular singing star Harriet Green  delights audiences with her coy rendition of Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a Bow Wow; however she has an illegitimate baby daughter that she keeps secret from the public. Blackmailed into leaving the stage she moves to South Africa to raise her daughter quietly. Years later her daughter, Harriet Hawkes , looking remarkably like her mother, returns to London as a young show-biz hopeful. A handsome young publicity man Tommy Thompson , convinces a theater producer  to star her in a new revue as the "remarkably preserved" original Harriet Green. The ruse works; however Harriet and Tommy have fallen in love, but the public believes Harriet is a well-preserved 60-year-old and Tommy is her son. The masquerade is revealed when Harriet does a strip-dance to the Harry M. Woods' song Over My Shoulder.
