Seventeen-year-old Marva Vereecken is a regular at singing contests which she never wins. When her father, Jean, gets laid off, he decides to kidnap the number one singer in the country, Debbie. The kidnapping greatly increases sales of Debbie's latest single, much to the pleasant surprise of Michael, Debbie's manager. Michael in turn proposes a secret deal to make Marva a star if Jean agrees to keep Debbie out of the way for as long as Michael wants.
