After inheriting a family resort in Hawaii, Susan  and Jeffrey Wyatt  decide this is the place to stay at their honeymoon. They both head for Hawaii with their triplets, Lisa, Jessie, and Megan Wyatt with Sharon Grand , Susan's twin sister. They find the resort in such a run-down condition, that they decide to repair it and sell it. The triplets, spending most of their time at the beach begin meeting boys while Susan and Jeffrey repair the resort. Jeffrey meets an old high school rival, Ray  who promises to keep the resort as-is if Jeffrey will sell it to him. He has other plans in mind, however, and they are not limited merely to Jeffrey's resort.
