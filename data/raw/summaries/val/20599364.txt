The Pink Panther goes fishing for an afternoon, and decides to stop first to purchase worms for bait. One worm, however, is reluctant to join the panther. The worm later tries to sabotage the panther's fishing trip by attaching the hook to the motor propeller of a nearby boat, and later cutting off the wire to the motor in the panther's own boat. Finally, the panther has to fight an extremely vicious crab he has fished up from the water.
