Reggie O’Brien  is a cab driver with an opinion on everything. When he is not taxiing his usual fares, Reggie can be found enjoying a game of bowling in the morning league, breaking for a cup of coffee with his cab-cleaning pal Mugford , arguing with his ex-wife Nola O’Brien , filling in his co-worker and former Pentecostal minister Pastor Bob  on the ways of secular world, hanging with his buddy Bounty “The Dog” Hunter , arguing with cab company owner Raoul Cassivi , or clashing with the authority of Kingston’s taxi commissioner, Bruno DeLuca . When a film crew spends a day with Reggie, documenting a day in the life of a cab driver, his world seems to fall apart. When he gets word that Pat James , the owner of his favourite radio station and Kingston’s only country music station, is going to flip to an “all women, all talk” format, Reggie pulls no stops to keep country music on Kingston’s airwaves. And just when he thinks he has a stake in the grand prize of the “Drink to the Bottom and Win” contest at the local coffee shop, he learns the true meaning of friendship. To keep his cab on the road, and his dream alive, Reggie has to overcome adversity, friendship, and himself.
