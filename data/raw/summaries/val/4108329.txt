What appears to be a moose emerging from a lake turns out to be Goofy and Donald Duck wearing the disguise of a female moose which inexplicably has antlers. In another part of the lake, Mickey Mouse emerges disguised as a tree, walking on stilts and carrying a shotgun. Mickey signals his two friends with a hunting horn. They meet up on land, and in a brief exchange it is learned that Goof and Donald are to attract a moose while Mickey is to actually shoot it. Donald applies makeup to the fake moose head and sprays perfume into the forrest. In no time they are able to attract a large male moose. Meanwhile in a different part of the forrest, Mickey comes across another male moose who starts eating the leaves off of Mickey's tree disguise. He accidentally drops his shotgun and destroys it. Just as the moose becomes aware of Mickey, he catches sight of the fake moose of Goofy and Donald. Eventually the two male moose encounter each other, and fight each other for the female. In the end, their body slamming of each other knocks Goofy and Donald out of a tree and reveals their disguise. When the moose realize they have been tricked, the chase the three hunters out of the forest.
