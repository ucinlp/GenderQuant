{{plot}} In the opening, A narrator tells us, It was unmistakable. A wolf rising it's stem and stern. It sailed drip blood, red. These things served but one purpose, to strike fear and terror into the hearts of any who came across them. A group of Vikings on a ship were headed for the ends of the Earth, which turns out to be a mysterious island. The narrator continues Each stroke, each painful breathe, they believed it brought them ever closer to the ends of the Earth. But onward they pushed, for the ends of the Earth they sought. Glory, Honor. These things awaited them there. But so did something else. Freyja, says it is Lingfei . Thor believes it to be a place to build a new kingdom for themselves. But he corrects himself, saying that it would be the kingdom of his brother, Baldur. But Baldur suggests to give it to their elder brother, Ulfrich, he joked about the island's weather suiting his temper. Upon arriving, Thor has deja vu-ing, as he had been there before. Freyja suggests that he has memories of his past life. Thor then said to her that if he lived before, then he had died as well. He said that was a mistake he would not make twise. Thor and Aegir go out scouting, but soon a werewolf grabs Aegir and runs off with him. Thor makes it back after two other werewolves run him up a tree, and soon the Vikings rally and go looking for Aegir. Instead, they find a village. Inside, were some starving people who have been walled into a house for months eating grubs in the dirt. They explain that they came here like the Vikings and then were attacked and trapped by the werewolves. Baldur decides to leave some men to guard the village as they continue looking for Aegir. Thor has a vision of a great warrior fighting a giant sea serpent, with a mighty hammer. Freyja says that Thor saw the Hammer of the Gods. Back at the village, the guards are attacked and killed by werewolves. As the group was crossing a wooden bridge, Freyja sees a vision of Baldur sacrificing his life. Then the group hears screaming, Baldur tells everyone to go back to the village. But when they got there, their men were gone. Baldur decides they go back to the ship to get the rest of the crew. Thor has another vision of the warrior holding the hammer to the heavens, the lightning struck the hammer, filling it with power. When Thor saw this, he felt the lightning itself! Freyja tells him that his visions are clues to finding the hammer and it is at the top of the mountain on the island. When they reach the shore, their guards are gone, and the ship disappeared, so the vikings are trapped. They go back to the village for the night, but the people there are also missing. The vikings set up the fort and then wait for night. The werewolves run in and soon everyone is fighting. The Vikings make a good stand, they kill several of the werewolves to only one Viking loss. Thor cut off a werewolf's head. The werewolves retreat and drag off their dead, except the head of one werewolf, which Thor stuck on a pick. The werewolf head is soon a human head, and the Vikings figure out what their enemies are. Freyja also finds a bowl that had the inscription “Beware the sons of Loki” who are Jörmungandr the Midgard Serpent, and Fenris the wolf. To give weight to the Fenris name, inside a cave, a werewolf reverts to human form, Hel, and report in to Fenris. He tells Hel to get Thor and kill everyone else. So she interrogates some prisoners, and uses a werewolf named Skull to torture them. Back at the village, Ulfrich is angered over an imagined Thor and Sif affair. Ulfrich challenges Thor to a duel. After a minute or two Baldur stops it, then Ulfrich just leaves. Seconds later, Hel comes to see Ulfrich and asks him to join them, and also kisses him. The Vikings head to the mountain, to search for the hammer, but run into Ulfrich and two werewolves. After words are exchanged, Ulfrich fights Baldur as the rest are told to run. Ulfrich slices Baldur in the back, but Baldur then runs, and he gets on the bridge they were at before. As the werewolves also get on the bridge, Baldur stops in the middle and destroys the bridge! The bridge falls and Baldur and the werewolves die. The Vikings set traps for the werewolves which basically means waiting at the bottom of a hill, and tossing spears up at them. This strategy proves deadly for the werewolves. Ulfrich sneers and then heads back to the werewolf base. That night, an old man falls out of a tree, the Vikings run to the man named, Vali, who tells the same story the villagers did, so they cut off a finger to see if it grows back. It doesn’t, and Vali tells them the story of the Hammer of the Gods. He told them the hammer fell from the heavens, a mighty gift from Odin himself. It's power was so great, that only one mortal man could wield it. He tells them that on that very island they were standing on, the chapion killed Jörmungandr at the same time it killed him, so the hero was victorious, but at a cost, his life. Vali then said that Odin was pleased though, so it was written that the champion would one return, and reclaim his place as the god of thunder. Thor sees another vision, seeing that he was the chosen one to wield the Hammer of the Gods. So Thor plans to get the hammer, kill Fenris, and find their ship to leave. At the werewolf base, they see their ship near the hideout, Thor sends the Viking Brothers to secure it for departure, while the rest sneak in the back door. Ulfrich is at the back waiting for them, so he and Thor fight as the girls and Vali sneak inside. Thor stabs Ulfrich in the chest, but Ulfrich just laughs, and partially morphs into a werewolf. Ulfrich throws Thor's sword up a tree, Thor jumps, grabs his sword, and slices Ulfrich in two at the same time. Inside, Sif, Freyja, and Vali kill the captured and mortally wounded Viking Aegir, to free him from his own pain, and then confronted by Hel. She says Vali is also after the Hammer, but he disappeares. Now it is a lady fight! Thor almost comes in, but they tell him to go after the hammer, so he goes and finds it. Thor also finds Fenris, who tells him he had waited a long time for Thor's return. He even calls Thor, Son of Odin, meaning Odin is Thor's father. Thor asks Fenris why he keeps the hammer close. Fenris replies that it is because Thor is drawn to the hammer, his lust for it. Thor says he'll need it back now, then Fenris tells him to come and try to take it. Then the two fight. At the women fight, Freyja is killed, but then Sif kills Hel. Sif tells the dead Freyja that she will see her again, on the plains of Asgard. Then Sif goes and distracts Fenris, while Thor grabs the Hammer and smashes Fenris' head. Fenris is dead, Thor and Sif hug each other and leave. Then they go out the front way, and find the werewolves waiting for them. Thor goes over to them, and slams the hammer down onto the ground, and a thunderous shockwave kills all the werewolves. Thor and Sif hug, while Vali appears, and asks if he could touch the hammer. Thor asks him how he would know Vali wouldn't use it against him. Vali said that only Thor could wield it. But Thor says, I'll think about it. They all laughed. Then they went down to the ship. The Viking Brothers lived, Thor shows them the hammer, and yell with joy. The narrator tells us, So, they sailed away from Midgard's edge, each lost in their own silent contemplation. Though they dwarn the day, they left more on that Isle, than they'd taken. So that's what they did, and sailed back home.
