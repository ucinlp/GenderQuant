Megan cuts the string, making the snowman glide away leading to Josh running after it. The scene shifts to Drake and Josh going to the Premiere. Drake tells Josh that he will be throwing a Christmas party on the roof of the Premiere, which Josh doesn't approve of at first because he is not sure that Helen  would approve. Drake tells him that he has already talked to Helen about it and that its alright as long as she is invited . Helen hands Drake a Santa costume to wear in the mall. Josh is upset because Helen told him that he couldn't be Santa . Meanwhile Audrey and Walter make it to their island, which turns out to be a disaster. Back at the mall, Drake makes out with a teenage girl. Josh is annoyed and tries to get their attention eventually yelling "Santa!!" at which point they break and Drake pulls his beard back up and says "And that's for being such a good girl". One of the other people, which happens be to an overweight woman who likes Drake, waiting in line for Santa says "I want some of what that girl was having", climbs on Drake, starting to chase him eventually leading him to steal an old ladies electronic wheelchair to flee from her shouting "Santa's not looking for a relationship right now!" as he goes. He hides and he meets a little girl named Mary Alice Johansson . She says she and her family want the best Christmas ever. He made a Christmas promise he will do so; but it is said in the film that "you can't break a Christmas promise", and Drake doesn't realize he will have to give her family the "best Christmas ever". Next they're at Drake's Christmas Party up on the roof of the Premiere. At the party, Mindy  has to leave to go and visit her grandparents, leaving Josh upset. Crazy Steve  shows up in front of Drake and Josh, and shows them a wood chipper called "Sally" on his cell phone. Craig  and Eric  come and tell Drake that the last song was great and he should perform it in the Christmas parade, but Drake says that the parade is for dorks and losers and that he is going to Las Vegas for Christmas to hear a band play inviting Josh when he gets upset that they won't be able to spend Christmas together and Josh becoming even more upset and saying "I don't want to spend Christmas Day in a casino". Later on, a few party crashers come to the party, wrecking the tables and food bowls. When Josh calls the police, they inadvertently mistake him for one of the party crashers and arrest him. Not watching Drake, Josh falls off the roof and lands in the back of a pickup truck. The truck drivers drive off with the cops on their tail . When the truck drivers drive around an intersection, Josh is catapulted out, making the cops arrest him and he shouts "There's been a terrible mistake!". After Josh is arrested and sent to jail, he meets his prison roommate, Bludge . At first, Bludge tries to beat him up, until Josh entertains Bludge with magic tricks. This makes Bludge change his mind about Josh. However, he says he claims he has to beat him up, so he can protect his reputation in jail. Bludge and Josh bang on the walls with Josh pretending to shout in pain, to get others to believe Josh is getting beat up. Mary Alice brings up a story of how she has a sick foster mom and a busy foster dad. Drake knowing he has to fulfill that promise, attempts to break Josh out to help him. But Drake is caught immediately after, landing both Drake and Josh in trouble. Drake and Josh are sent to court and Helen acts as their lawyer. Helen tells Judge Newman  that Drake has made a promise to Mary Alice that he'd give her the best Christmas ever. Then the judge says that he won't send them to jail as long as they fulfill that promise. They meet the cruel and embittered Officer Perry Gilbert ([[David Pressman , who says that he will take a vote from Mary Alice's family on Christmas asking them if they had the best Christmas ever. If any of them says no, they must go to jail for a long time. The duo soon meet Mary Alice's foster family, which include Lily and Violet , two constantly pounding-on-each-other twins, Zigfee  a foreign guy who speaks an unknown language, Trey , a know-it-all, and Luke  Mary Alice's brooding older brother who refuses to join in with everyone else. They find many ways to give Mary Alice's family the best Christmas ever, but their attempts are foiled by much interference from Officer Gilbert. Drake and Josh confront Megan, asking her to sabotage Officer Gilbert's doings by bribing her with a rare Smith Royal oboe. However, after hearing rumors that the oboe doesn't exist, Megan angrily breaks her promise to Drake and Josh and stops messing with Officer Gilbert. Josh goes to visit Officer Gilbert's mother and claims he must hate him and Drake somehow for making his life miserable. His mother remarks Officer Gilbert does not hate them; he hates Christmas. Then, she tells Josh how Officer Gilbert always wanted a pet chimpanzee for Christmas when he was eight and how on Christmas morning, a monkey was sitting by the tree in a cage. But when he opened the cage door, the monkey ran out, attacked him, smashed the presents, knocked down the tree, destroyed the ornaments, and urinated on him. He has hated Christmas ever since. Drake and Josh realize that since Christmas was ruined for him, he wants to ruin it for everyone else. At the Christmas parade, Officer Gilbert tricks Crazy Steve  into "reminding" the two in front of Mary Alice that they were only being kind to her so that they wouldn't go to prison. Mary Alice and her family leave and threaten to vote "no" when the courthouse asks them to vote, thinking jail as punishment for Drake and Josh for tricking the family . Drake and Josh both decide to keep their promise no matter what. So the duo sends Officer Gilbert a sweet baby chimpanzee named Cookie as a Christmas present, completely changing his personality. Then, they try to use Crazy Steve's wood chipper to make it snow in front of Mary Alice's house. The wood chipper shoots large chunks of ice through the neighborhood where Mary Alice lives and causes more trouble as it destroys everything and nearly kills Mary Alice and her family. During the disaster, Drake manages to carry Mary Alice out of the way of the flying ice chunks and puts her safely behind a nearby car before returning to help his brother turn off the out-of-control wood chipper. The chipper knocks out Drake and Josh and the now-kind Officer Gilbert and the other officers take them home. The next morning, Officer Gilbert explained to Mary Alice and her family what really happened, and that Drake and Josh weren't really trying to use them to stay out of prison. They have Officer Gilbert and the other officers "arrest" them and bring them to the living room, where Mary Alice's family and other people surprise them. They then have the vote on whether they all had the best Christmas ever or not, and everyone votes "yes", with Zigfee learning his first ever English word. As they start singing, Josh's former cell mate Bludge comes down the chimney, breaking it in the process to deliver gifts to Mary Alice's family, including a Smith Royal oboe for Megan, which Drake had previously promised. Mindy arrives too, wanting to learn everything that happened and Crazy Steve gets "Sally" to make snow by using seven thousand pounds of "hard cheese". Drake and Josh's parents then arrive home from their troubled vacation at their "bungalow", which is blown away earlier in a tropical storm. Everyone then plays in the blanket of "cheese snow", the film then draws to a close, as everyone has "The Best Christmas Ever".
