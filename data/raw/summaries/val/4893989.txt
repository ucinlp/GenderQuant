In the centre of the bridge over the river which separates the Irish villages of Carrickdowse and Ballydowse is a white line that few young people dare cross. That's because the youths of the two towns spend most of their time trying to one-up the other, whether it's over the sale of hospital raffle tickets or something more important, such as deciding who's a "tosspot" and who isn't, or, for that matter, defining what a tosspot is. This War of the Buttons has been going on as long as any of the youths can remember, and as far as they're concerned, it's "to the death", though rarely does either group hurt more than its pride. The leader of the Ballys is a not-too-promising student named Fergus , son of a pauper family, who lives with his mother and an abusive man, who is apparently not his father , in a trailer on the edge of Ballydowd. What Fergus lacks in education he makes up for in leadership, and the youth of Ballydowse will follow him anywhere, especially a girl named Marie , who acts as the story's narrator, reviving her memories of what happened from her adulthood point of view. The Carricks have a leader too: Jerome, a.k.a. Geronimo , son of a wealthy family. The story tracks the escalating events of the gangs' feud, their class differences , Fergus's troubles with his oppressive environment and the conflicts brought upon when the adults of the villages find out about it, as well as the conflicts within the members of the Ballys. The strategic operations of the latter ones to win the war, including a nude ambush mounted on their enemies, are shown in great detail. The groups clash in several battles, with the final one aiming to conquer the Carrickss "castle", but Geronimo and Reilly, a kid who did not participate in the final battle because he didn't want to get hurt drives Reilly's father's new tractor into the Bally Base, an old barn. Fergus and Geronimo are blamed for it and run off, only to have their families disown them, and to be put in the Church Orphanage, where it turns out Marie grows up to marry one of them and the other becomes their closest friend, but she does not reveal which is which.
