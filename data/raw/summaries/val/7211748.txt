Workers from the Never Mine wash up before eating lunch at Betty Boop's Tavern, where Betty sings and dances while they dine. After lunch is over, the miners all return to work . An excited Bimbo runs around, singing "I Heard", and calls Betty to come down into the mine. She takes the dumbwaiter down, but the cable snaps and plunges to the bottom. The crash leaves her unhurt, but clad only in her lingerie . The two discover a team of ghosts playing a game of baseball, with a cartoon bomb as the ball. Bimbo and Betty head to the surface in the elevator, unwittingly carrying the bomb with them. They send it back down, and the resultant explosion fills all the railroad cars with coal. The ghosts are also blown into the air, and land in graves opened by a laughing Bimbo.
