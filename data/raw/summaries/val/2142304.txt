A nameless boy, who was abandoned at a very young age faces taunts from the other children in his village. He asks the priest what his name is to which the priest answers "Ram Jaane"  which the boy accepts as his name. Ram Jaane and his friend Murli are caught stealing from a train by corrupt police officer, Inspector Chewte . Chewte beats Ram Jaane in prison but he is released without charge. Years later, Ram Jaane  is working under Sameer Sanwla  - Sanwla is murdered by Chewte and when Ram Jaane attempts to kill Chewte, he is again put in prison. When released from prison, Ram Jaane is taken by Murli  to 'Apna Ghar', a home set up for the homeless - Murli believes that this is the best way to reform him, it is here where Ram Jaane is reunited with his childhood friend Bela  whom he is in love with. However even in Apna Ghar, Ram Jaane still remains a criminal and even manages to influence the children in the house to follow in his footsteps. Apna Ghar is soon targeted by Baweja , who encourages his gang to attack Apna Ghar and all its residents, which Ram Jaane is able to stop. Ram Jaane is then seen shooting Baweja in the head. Chewte learns of Baweja's death and is determined to have his murderer put in prison - he approaches Apna Ghar and starts beating one of the children which leads to Murli and the others attacking Chewte and his fellow officers. In the riot, one of the children is killed. Murli blames Ram Jaane for this tragedy and Ram Jaane runs away, he attempts to make Bela run away with him  but she refuses. Bela is, in fact, in love with Murli - Murli realised this all along and reciprocated her feelings but did not show it as he realised that Ram Jaane also loved her. Murli begs Bela to attempt to reform Ram Jaane. However, whilst trying to reform him, Bela only begins to dislike him for his criminal ways. Bhau , Ram Jaane's rival and Technicolour , Ram Jaane's former partner in crime hatch a plot to kill Ram Jaane - when he hears of their plan, he kills them both and then rushes to Apna Ghar to stop their henchmen from killing anyone. Eventually Chewte arrives but is shot by Ram Jaane. Ram Jaane is taken to court where he confesses to all of his sins - the court decides that he must be sentenced to death. On the day of his death, Bela rushes to stop him but is too late - after his death, she and Murli read a letter from Ram Jaane to Bela which states that he feels guilty for everything he had done.
