The story is about a man known only as 'K', who is somewhere in his 30s and is a heavy chain-smoker. He is very confident in himself and very arrogant in nature. Catching hold of his smoking habit from a very young age, he hasn't looked back ever since. K is also revealed to have smoked spiked ganja and landed up in hospital due to it. His well-wishers have tried in vain to make him quit but to no avail. Both his friends Abbas Tyrewala and the doctor who treats K's brother, offer to set up an appointment at a rehabilitation center called 'Prayogshaala', which they claim will rid K of his dreadful habit. K finally relents after his wife Anjali leaves him, unable to take the strain K's smoking places on their relationship. K decides to check out Prayogshaala, and meets Shri Shri Prakash Guru Ghantal Baba Bengali Sealdahwale, the man who is to save him. When he gets to Kalkatta Karpets, the front for the unconventional rehab center, his Labyrinth-esque adventure starts. The method Prayogshaala uses to cure their patients of their addiction is 'fear'. Each time a patient gives in to their vice, Baba makes sure that something shocking happens to them. #The first offense is almost killing a loved one by keeping him/her in a chamber full of cigarette smoke the person has smoked in his entire life for a duration of 5 minutes. #The second offense is losing a finger. #The third offense is the death of a loved one. #The last offense is taking the soul of the person from his body although this offense is described very loosely. K refuses to sign the contract and pay the fee of Twenty one lakh Eleven thousand and one Rupees for his treatment but is forced to do so by Baba Bengali and his disciples.
