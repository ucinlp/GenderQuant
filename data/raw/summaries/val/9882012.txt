Advanced British aircraft prototypes carrying experimental and highly secret equipment being developed under government contract, are regularly vanishing with their crews on their test flights. No one can deduce the problem, not even spymaster Major Hammond  or his sister Kay , a newspaper reporter who is working undercover in the works canteen used by the crews at the Barrett & Ward Aircraft Company. At first, Major Hammond is seen as an outsider at the aircraft factory, even by Mr. Barrett, the owner ([[George Merritt , but he soon finds a friend in a star pilot, Tony McVane  who helps him try to unravel the case. Hammond becomes convinced that the company secretary at the factory, Jenkins ([[George Curzon  is a foreign agent and "mole", but Jenkins is killed by unseen gunmen before he can give up the names of his contacts. The mystery remains unsolved when McVane returns to the aircraft factory, determined to make the next test flight. His aircraft, like the others, is brought down by a powerful ray beamed from the S.S. Viking, a mysterious salvage ship manned by a foreign crew. The nationality of the crew and agents aboard the S.S. Viking is unspecified, but can be presumed to be German. Along with his aircraft, McVane and his flight crew are taken hostage on the ship, where he discovers many other missing airmen have suffered the same fate. Gathering up weapons, McVane leads the British survivors in an attempt to take control of the ship. Major Hammond learns the truth and directs a Royal Navy ship  to come to their rescue. In a short coda, Kay and McVane get together and Hammond learns, to his chagrin, that his longtime lady friend has married.
