Shyam  is a typical 10 year old boy, mischievous and very inquisitive. His world is made up of his father, Mouli- Bharat Jadhav - mother Manda , sister Dipti  & his best friend Gautam .The family lives in a small house on their cotton farm, somewhere in Central Maharashtra. The family earns its meagre living by growing cotton, which is sold at the local Government Cotton Mill. The family is in debt to the local money lender Shiva , to the local shopkeeper, and to the fertilizer shop. There is no money, even for essentials. But, Shyam is least concerned with all this. Most of his time is spent in exploring, discovering & playing with Gautam. The major concerns in his life are the state of his school uniform  and whether his mother will make bhajjis  for dinner. Shyam’s idyllic life is thrown asunder when he realises that his family is reeling under debt and his father has all but given up hope of ever getting his farm lands out of mortgage. All dreams of a new school uniform & bhajjis come crashing down. After overcoming his initial dejection, Shyam takes it upon himself to save his family. He is not so easily overcome by his parents’ sense of impending doom. The lessons he has learnt at school give him reason to hope. One day in school, he comes across an announcement that might just do the trick – a sack race that carries a Winner’s Prize of Rupees 10,000/- . With the help of Dipti and Gautam, he begins practising with the sack for the big day. Mouli is at first perplexed by Shyam’s antics but later joins in enthusiastically. After all he wants to see his family happy in its last few days. Meanwhile our little hero is hard at practice , with a single-minded aim of saving his family. Come D-day, Shyam runs the race of his life – literally! But can he save his family?
