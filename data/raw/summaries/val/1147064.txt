The special begins with adult versions of Timmy Turner's closest friends Chester and AJ battling against the dictatorship of Vicky, who has tyrannically overtaken the future as empress reigning over a bleak and melancholy society in an attempt to guard a magical television remote for her. However, the remote is snatched by a mysterious and trusted masked accomplice of Vicky, who uses its abilities to travel back in time. In present-day Dimmsdale, controversies are brewed over the supreme amount of violence in a popular new anime television series "Maho Mushi" which has acquired popularity amongst children in town, who start to emulate the more violent elements contained within the series. However, with the help of his fairies' magic, Timmy conjures up a gigantic spacecraft that was seen in an episode of the program and inadvertently winds up destroying his father's newly-cleaned office and a glass house that his mother had been attempting to sell, ruining both parents' chances of achieving respective goals. Timmy's television privileges are removed after his parents connect the similarities of his behavior to elements from "Maho Mushi", so Timmy requests a magical television remote capable of teleporting him into the fictional universes in which his favorite series are set. However, Timmy winds up catastrophically sabotaging the Turner household with a weapon he'd obtained from characters from an animated television program he visited, so Vicky is hired to babysit him while his parents leave to purchase ammunition so they may use the device to destroy the Dinkleberg residence. After having had the other remote confiscated, Timmy wishes for a new one, this time so he may run away from home and the inevitability of him one day maturing and having his fairy godparents leave him manditorily and leaves; under the watchful eye of Vicky's mysterious accomplice. Meanwhile, Vicky winds up stumbling upon the other remote and discovers its abilities after it somehow transports her into a game show. She decides to use the magic of the device to teleport herself to "Dictator Week" on the "Biographical Channel" so she may alter history and conquer society. In the meantime, Timmy enjoys his pursuit of searching for a television universe in which he may live; however, he is infuriated by the suspicious stranger who keeps pursuing him on his travels. Suspecting him a threat, Timmy winds up encountering the masked man up close after journeying into a parody of "Batman" who reveals himself to be an adult version of Timmy. He reveals about the bleak upcoming future and cautions his younger self about the hazards of the remotes, and that he credits Vicky's power with the alterations she tweaked to Dictator Week. After learning that Vicky also has gained possession of a magic remote control, the group plots to travel to Maho Mushi to defeat her. As the two opposing sides travel through a variety of parodies, the Turners leave in search of their missing son to no avail. After encountering a mysterious personality known as "Deep Toot" , she reveals Vicky's fa√ßade and her true behavior. Realizing they were wrong, the Turners leave in search of Timmy, who gradually begins to miss his family. Shortly before their arrival in Maho Mushi, Timmy's future self is annihilated, leaving it up to Timmy to save the fate of the universe. Vicky and Timmy battle against each other in an arena using the powers granted to them by their respective remotes, and Timmy successfully manages to conquer Vicky after nearly losing Cosmo and Wanda. Shortly after departing from the Maho Mushi universe, a televised message from Timmy's heartbroken parents appears, leading their son to decide to return home, to the joy of Mr. and Mrs. Turner, who choose to fire Vicky. However, Timmy uses the fairy godparents' magic to destroy their memories, realizing that Vicky's cruelty supplies him with the primary reason for his possession of fairies, and buries a time capsule filled with memories and a photograph of Cosmo and Wanda so he will never forget. In the future, the time capsule is uncovered by Timmy's future children, Tammy and Tommy, albeit their father now has no memory of his fairy godparents. He leaves his children under the care of a robotic, torturous babysitter resembling Vicky, oblivious to the true intentions of the evil robot, as it is revealed that Cosmo and Wanda now serve as Tommy and Tammy's fairies.
