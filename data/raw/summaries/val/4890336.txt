Ida, with help from her two best friends Sebastian and Jonas, robs a bank in which her mother works in order to get the money required to save her dying father. During the heist, the kids overcome high-tech security systems, guard dogs, and a nasty head of security to get to a bank vault suspended 100 feet off the ground.
