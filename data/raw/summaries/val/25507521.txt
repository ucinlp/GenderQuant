Frustrated at being stuck in a sexless marriage, a man gets seduced by his boss and attempts to even the playing field by getting his wife to cheat on him. Dan  has a problem; he's just married the beautiful Marcie  for three months, but they still haven't consummated their union. When Dan's sex-crazed boss Catherine  comes on to him during a marathon work session, he crumbles under temptation. Immediately regretting his actions but unable to simply admit his indiscretion, Dan schemes with his best pal Mike  to get Marcie to wander astray, too. If Dan isn't the only one who cheated, he and Mike surmise, then Marcie can't be mad at him for doing so. But hatching the plan is one thing, and finding a guy who's willing to go along with his plan is an altogether different challenge. Later, as the plan finally starts to come together, Dan discovers the truth about why Marcie has yet to sleep with him, and comes to realize that they may actually be the perfect couple after all.
