Tony Mareda, Jr., a former Olympic athlete turned world's greatest private detective, is driving across the country when he is attacked by mobsters. Chased to the sleepy backwater town of Beamsville, Tony ducks into the local drive-in theater, where he is followed by his pursuers. As Tony hunts down and dispatches the hit men amidst the parked cars, a pink meteor roars overhead and crashes in the nearby woods, causing the townspeople to rush out of the theater to look for it. As the young couples search the woods, however, the women begin to hear a ringing sound coming from the glowing pink rock that turns them into lusty nymphomaniacs. Now under the thrall of the meteor, the women defend it by seducing the men. One of the few who avoids the effect is the local TV weatherman, Clip Bacardi, who is too engrossed in his discovery of a small fragment of the meteor to notice the attempts by his temporarily-aroused girlfriend, librarian Mary Ann Kowalski, to come onto him. The next morning, the local authorities discover an empty crater where the meteor landed, with the men who went looking for it in catatonic states scattered throughout the woods. Facing a challenge from Mary Ann in the upcoming election, the mayor of Beamsville orders the town deputy to enlist the help of Tony Mareda in finding out what happened to the men. That evening, however, Clip goes on the air with his fragment; the sound it emits transforms all of the women watching the broadcast into sex-hungry servants of the meteor. As Tony begins his investigation, the women incapacitate a key witness and take over the local television station. Escaping the women at the station, Clip joins Tony, the mayor, and other townspeople in forming a posse to hunt for the meteor; as they search the woods, Clip encounters his scantily-clad girlfriend, who nearly incapacitates him before Tony is able to render her unconscious using chloroform. After placing Mary Ann in the town jail, Tony and Clip go back into the woods and track the meteor to a cave. They escape a group of women who arrive to worship it, but their effort to drive to the next town for help is frustrated by a roadblock. They return to Beamsville to find that the women's takeover of the town is complete, with the remaining men wandering the streets in dazed stupors. Clip attempts to discover how to defeat the meteor by experimenting on the fragment he possesses, but is overcome by the fumes produced after accidentally setting it on fire. Tony is also subdued by a group of women in a pink Sherman tank, who knock him unconscious when they blast apart the town jail where he takes refuge. Tony is awakened back in the cave by Mary Ann, who announces that the meteor, which she refers to as "Betty," has chosen him to be the father of its offspring. As the meteor draws Tony to it, however, the cave wall to which he is chained collapses and the chamber is flooded with water &mdash; the meteor's weakness. After it is washed out of the cave, Tony and Mary Ann  work together to push the pulsating rock into the town lake, destroying it and returning the controlled women to normal.
