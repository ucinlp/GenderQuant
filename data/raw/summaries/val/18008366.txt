Skip Lewis  is a 17 year-old boy who has been having academic problems; also, a girl named Andrea, whom he has been pursuing has told him that she has no interest in him. He tries to talk to his parents  about this but can't bring himself to, thinking that they won't understand. He commits suicide by driving his car over a cliff onto rocks. Now, his parents are in denial saying that his death was an accident. However, his best friend, Ken Cruze  who was the last person he saw before his death, was told by Skip that he was considering killing himself and is feeling guilty that he didn't try to stop him. Skip's sister Cindy  tries to bring her family out of denial so they can heal.
