The film is about an evil living dead girl named Evelyn who decides that she needs friends. Her gifts for other girls  only scare them. Evelyn then tries to resurrect herself through suicide, after reading a book entitled How to Kill Yourself Back to Life. Her suicide attempts fail; part of the problem is that she wastes her bullets killing birds instead of herself, and she swings on her rope instead of hanging herself. Eventually, one boy  is killed in a bus accident and becomes a living dead friend for her.
