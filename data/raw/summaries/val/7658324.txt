Reuben Soady  goes to the hunting camp cottage, otherwise known as deer camp, with his father Albert , brother Remnar  and Jimmy "the Jimmer" Negamanee from Menominee . If Reuben, now 43, doesn't manage to shoot a buck by the end of the season, he will become the oldest Soady in recorded history not to have achieved this task, a taboo that leads people in the community to believe he is jinxed. Reuben breaks with tradition, taking advice from his Native American wife Wolf Moon Dance , who offers him spiritual remedies involving a drink made with moose testicles and porcupine urine to protect him from evil spirits. After various unexplainable phenomena, they meet a DNR officer, Tom T. Treado , who claims to have literally seen God on the ridge. At various times, Reuben, Jimmer, and ranger Tom all get possessed by spirits. Eventually, Reuben runs out into the cold wearing only his long underwear and a hat, and finds himself face-to-face with his dead great-grandfather Alphonse, who guides him to shooting a buck sent for him by the spirits. Reuben returns triumphantly.
