On 5 December 1492, a gang led by former bishop Niklas is killed by villagers who refuse to put up with the gang's looting and killing any longer. In years in which the gang's death date coincides with a full moon, they return as murderous ghosts. The public is unaware of this and annually celebrates the Sinterklaas tradition on 5 December, with adults not believing that Sinterklaas does exist, but making little children believe that he is benevolent. The Zwarte Pieten are not black by race but as a result of the fire in which they were killed. Niklas' crosier has sharp edges and is a weapon. On 5 December Sinterklaas and the Zwarte Pieten do not stand out, as many people are dressed like them for the celebration. The last time the ghostly gang returned was in 1968. Hundreds of people were killed, including the whole family of a little boy, Goert, who is now a police officer. The authorities downplay the incidents, and they, as well as the Roman Catholic Church, keep the possible involvement of Niklas a secret. Since there is a full moon on 5 December 2010, Goert is very concerned, and recommends forbidding all Sinterklaas activities and increasing surveillance, but he is not taken seriously and sent on leave. As Goert predicted, the gang returns, and kills hundreds of people. While the gang is immune to bullets, they are finally chased away by fire. In addition to Goert, the student Frank also plays a heroic role in the film.
