Set 18 months after the events of the second movie, an attack is taking place in Washington DC, explosions, helicopters and machine guns firing. A man runs through a burning White House to the Oval Office. United States President Gerald Fitzhugh  videotapes his confession in the oval office of The White House. Afterwards, he looks out the window as a shadowy figure arrives in the background. The movie then cuts one week earlier. The Tribulation Force, consisting of Rayford Steele, his daughter Chloe Steele, Buck Williams, Bruce Barnes, and Chris Smith, and many other unnamed people, are in the process of stealing Bibles from a Global Community  compound. The GC bursts into the warehouse and shoots Chris Smith wounding while the remaining Trib Force members escape. The guards ask Chris who he works for to which he replies "The Son of Man," they ask him again and Chris' answer is "God Almighty" at that point the guard executes him. At Washington, D.C., somewhere at a rural lake, the president and his vice-president, John Mallory, are taking some time away from the White House. Mallory informs Fitzhugh of Nicolae's plans and how he has found evidence that Nicolae is planning an attack on American soil. Before he shares the information, a car explodes behind them. Troops storm in attempting to kill the President. Another man fires a rocket-propelled grenade and Mallory dies from the ambush attack, but a militia group comes to the aid of the President. Back at the Trib Force underground headquarters, Bruce Barnes performs a double wedding ceremony: Buck to Chloe, and Rayford to Amanda White, the newest member who once knew Rayford's first wife before the vanishings. After the ceremony is over, Buck heads over to L.A. and Rayford flies to New Babylon. Nicolae meets with Fitzhugh who expresses his deepest concern over the news of Mallory's death, and teams up with Carolyn Miller , who poses as Nicolae's top aide at GC headquarters. Together, they find Nicolae's secret plan of stealing bibles and lacing them with anthrax before distributing them. The GC block their escape, with Fitzhugh killing one of the guards in the process. Fitzhugh is recruited by Miller's ragtag military team to help take out Nicolae, which he participates in. As Fitzhugh enters the GC building and asks to see the president . Fitzhugh enters Nicolae's office, but Nicolae was already aware of Fitzhugh's assassination attempt and foils it. Fitzhugh tries to shoot Nicolae with three rounds, but isn't affected as they go through him and hit a guard instead. Nicolae turns on all of the TVs in his office revealing that World War III has begun, the screens shows footage of cities being destroyed, bombs being dropped  and a wave  destroying an aircraft carrier. Outside in the background of Nicolae's office, air raid sirens are blaring, explosions rise into the sky and machine guns and tank blasts are heard. Using supernatural techniques, Nicolae throws Fitzhugh out of a 20-story window, landing on top of a car. Nicolae goes over to the window to see, in disgust, Fitzhugh getting up and walking away. Nicolae then looks to the sky and say, "That's not humanly possible, is it?". Everyone is shocked when Fitzhugh returns to the militia base and informs them that the plan failed: Carolyn takes this the hardest. The underground Trib Force HQ is hit as World War III approaches. Bruce and Chloe are infected with the virulent bacteria, but in the end it is Chloe who survives when red wine, used in the communion they just took part of, is revealed to be the antidote. Buck meets Fitzhugh in a destroyed White House, where he helps the president become a Christian. Fitzhugh then confronts Nicolae where he activates a personal transmitter , hoping to obliterate the entire GC headquarters, and himself, with a missile locked onto the transmitter's location. The missile hits the GC building and Fitzhugh is killed in the explosion as the building collapses and dust flies from the bottom. Buck Williams then gets a call in the elevator from Chloe as she tells him about the wine and Bruce's death. Buck promises to come home from his trip soon as the elevator stops and the door opens to reveal an armed Carolyn. She lowers her weapon and Buck states that "we need to talk," implying that they had met before. Before the credits, what's left of the Global Community Building is burning down, police sirens are wailing in the background and explosions are still going on. Nicolae Carpathia walks out from the flames looking very mad, completely unharmed.
