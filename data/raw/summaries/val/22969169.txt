James "Jimmy" Monroe and Paul Hodges  are cops working for the NYPD who celebrated their ninth year together as partners. After failing to capture suspect Juan Diaz  and for causing a disastrous neighborhood shootout and beating up a child, Jimmy and Paul are suspended without pay. Jimmy's daughter Ava  is getting married, and the price for the wedding is close to fifty thousand dollars. Though his ex-wife Pam's second husband Roy ([[Jason Lee  offers to pay for the wedding, Jimmy is determined to find a way to come up with the money so that Roy will not humiliate him. Paul is worried that his wife Debbie  is cheating on him, so he sets up a secret video camera in a teddy bear. While Jimmy is selling a 1952 Andy Pafko baseball card to pay for the wedding, he is robbed by Dave , who steals his card and Paul's favorite gun. They find out that Dave is going to rob a house that night so they stake out the house to retrieve the card and gun. Jimmy and Paul arrest Dave and discover he has sold the card and gun for drugs. Jimmy and Paul go to the dealer, Poh Boy ([[Guillermo DÃ­az , who tells them they may have the card if they retrieve a stolen car. When they find the car, they discover a distressed woman named Gabriela  in the trunk. Gabriela reveals that she is the mistress of a murdered drug lord who was kidnapped by Poh Boy's gang. Jimmy previews the tape from Paul's hidden camera and finds what looks to be Debbie and another man, but tells Paul there is nothing on it. Paul then sees the tape from his hidden camera and is heartbroken when he sees that Jimmy has lied: Debbie is with another man in their bedroom. Gabriela does not want to get Jimmy and Paul hurt, so she flees, leaving them a flashdrive concealed in a cross, which contains information about dealer's contact numbers. Jimmy and Paul pay Dave's bail so that he may retrieve the card and gun but he falls out of a tree and dies. Jimmy goes in to retrieve the card, but is surrounded by the gang. At the same time, Paul learns that Debbie is not cheating on him after all: she has played a trick on him for hiding the camera in their bedroom. After killing most of the gang, Jimmy and Paul find Poh Boy holding Gabriela at gunpoint. They shoot him dead, but Paul's bullet goes through the head of the baseball player on Jimmy's card, which is hidden in Poh Boy's shirt pocket. Pleased with the duo's investigation and assisting two colleagues  who were caught in the shootout, the precinct chief  restores Jimmy and Paul to active duty and gives them commendations. Dejected at the destruction of his prized card, Jimmy lets Roy pay for the wedding. Pam asks a favor of Jimmy that he and Roy give away Ava together. Jimmy says nothing about it. Paul discreetly points his pistol at Roy and orders him to sit down at the moment the priest calls out the father who would give away Ava. During the closing credits, bonus scenes finds Dave did not die in the fall when he pulls a prank on the coroner opening the body bag by doing one of his knock-knock jokes resulting in her fleeing in horror while Dave exits the body bag in laughter.
