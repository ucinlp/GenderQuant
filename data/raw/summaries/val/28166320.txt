After being suspended for taking a bribe, Lokayukta officer Vishwanath  is left to be always in the house surrounded by his over powering wife and three careless daughters. To get back his respect, he gets help from his lawyer friend Murthy  and puts up a dramatized make believe plot that he has an affair with a young and sexy lass called Veena  who starts visiting his home. On seeing this, the enraged and confused wife Malavika  seeks her bumbling brother's help  to get revenge on the husband. Things go haywire and take a comedic turn when Malavika starts getting involved, as a bluff, with a much younger fellow  who, coincidentally, is in a real affair with one of her own daughters!
