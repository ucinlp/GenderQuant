J. Harold Manners  is a millionaire playboy who accidentally finds himself in the poor part of town one day. There, he unknowingly gives a man enough money to start a religious mission. Once he hears that a mission was started in his name, he goes there to tell them to take his name off since  he didn't have anything to do with it. Once there, however, he falls for the Downtown Girl, Hope  who works in Brother Paul's  rebuilt mission. In order to build up attendance, and win Hope's attention, Harold runs through town causing trouble, and winds up with a crowd chasing him right into the mission. He eventually wins the girl and they marry, but not without some interference from his high-brow friends.
