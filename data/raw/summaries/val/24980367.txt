Daffy Duck, stranded in a snowstorm, takes refuge at the home of  a fox and weasel, who disguise themselves as kindly old ladies in order to keep Daffy in their home. They want Daffy for dinner, and so fatten him up by having him eat large portions of beans. Once Daffy realizes their intentions, he quickly tries to escape, outwitting the weasel but not the fox. Daffy forces the fox to chase him up a tree so he can kick him down, then runs further south, past three signs- "SOUTH", "SOUTH" and a final saying "AND WE DO MEAN SOUTH!" Daffy decides to remain in South America, emphasizing that he does mean South America.
