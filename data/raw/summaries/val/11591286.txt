In a mansion, Tom is whacking at Jerry with a heavy ball attached to a rope. The fourth time he swings, Tom hits a loose floorboard and sends Jerry into a clothes drawer. Tom is drawing back for another strike, but Jerry signals for Tom to stop. Tom brakes and catches his ball, but falls to the ground due to its weight. Jerry slaps Tom with a glove and Tom slaps himself. Tom hands Jerry a card. After Jerry reads it, he throws it aside and hands Tom his card. Tom and Jerry challenge each other to a duel. The duo preparing to duel wearing capes and top hats. FIRST CHALLENGE: Guns. Jerry and Tom march away from each other with guns, but Jerry staggers with the weight of the gun and it fires at Tom. Jerry titters, but the musket ball approaches behind him and nails him into the ground. SECOND CHALLENGE: Swords. Tom and Jerry rattle their swords, but Jerry ends up twisting his into a hook. Jerry throws his boomerang-sword which spears Tom in the back on its return. Jerry titters again, but Tom's sword digs into the ground right next to him and takes the mouse into the ground as well. THIRD CHALLENGE: Archery. Tom and Jerry both draw arrows, but they end up shooting themselves instead of the arrows. They hit each other and the screen explodes. FOURTH CHALLENGE: Cannons. Both rivals setup cannons and fire, instead of the balls to hit, the two crash back with their cannons and the two balls hit and fall. FINAL CHALLENGE: Slingshots. Both Jerry and Tom march away from each other with a slingshot and a rock. Jerry sets his weapon up and draws it back and it fires into Tom's stomach as he is turning around. Tom is pushed into a tree and fires his rock. It latches onto Jerry's slingshot and pushes him back into another tree. Tom's rock then latches onto his own slingshot. Tom peers at it and watches it hit his face. Tom then latches onto Jerry's slingshot and hits Jerry in the face. Tom is then launched back the other way and gets stuck in the tree. Tom frees himself and returns to the chase. The chase through the mansion is repeated, but this time Jerry issues the challenge and Tom declines by tearing up the card. Tom then pursues Jerry with the glove, slapping him.
