Working for the US Government to retrieve a cassette with vital information, Sam Quint, a former CIA agent , runs into Marvin Ringer , another hitman he replaced, who is after the same cassette. In a desperate attempt to evade Ringer and get the tape back to a government official , Quint hides the cassette in a 300-MPH prototype vehicle, the Black Moon, which is on a transporter destined for a public presentation in Los Angeles. Before Quint can recover the cassette, Nina  steals the Black Moon, with Quint on her tail, and returns it to a warehouse, the headquarters for the car thief ring headed by Ed Ryland . Quint must lure Nina into helping him recover the Black Moon, with the help of its driver and his crew, and make it out alive with the cassette and the car before the next day. The title was stolen from Violet Hawthorne's 1979 novel.{{Citation needed}}
