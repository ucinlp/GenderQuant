Paul Naschy returns as El Hombre Lobo for the sixth time as he searches for a cure to his lycanthropy by visiting the grandson of the infamous Dr. Jekyll. He is given a serum that transforms him into a Hyde-like personality in the hope that it will sublimate his werewolf self, but it results unfortunately in an even more savage monster. The film features a classic scene wherein the wolfman transforms in an elevator, much to the chagrin of a female fellow passenger. Famed Euro-horror star Jack Taylor played Dr. Henry Jekyll.
