Slip suggests that Louie take a vacation and hand over the responsibilities of the sweet shop to the boys. Louie reluctantly agrees and takes his wife to Coney Island. The boys decide to turn his sweet shop into an escort service and give the place a makeover. Meanwhile Gabe, who works as a messenger for a bank, has gotten himself into trouble. He had $5,000 of the bank's money stolen from him and local gangsters threaten to frame him for the theft unless he agrees to get the bank vault combination for them. He gives them the combination and the gangsters take over the sweet shop from Sach, who is minding it while Slip and the rest of the boys are out serving as escorts. Their goal is to dig from the sweet shop to the bank, and Sach allows them to after they convince him that they are government men looking for uranium. Eventually Slip, Louie, and the rest of the boys wind up back at the sweet shop and are pressed into service. Gabe goes to the police to tell the whole story, and as soon as he does, the gangsters dig through the police station floor  and are captured. Louie is temporarily pleased as Sach did find uranium under his store, but in the end it is discovered that he only owns the land...not the mineral rights! He faints and a doctor tells him all he needs is a vacation to feel better!
