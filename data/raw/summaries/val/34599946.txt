In the observatory, the astronomer is studying at his desk. Satan appears, then a woman appears and makes Satan vanish. Then she disappears. The astronomer draws a globe on a blackboard. The globe develops a sun-like head and limbs and starts to move on the blackboard. The astronomer looks through a small telescope. The moon appears in a building as a large face. It has eaten the astronomer's telescope. Men tumble from its mouth. Then the moon is in the sky. The astronomer, in different dress, stands on a table, which disappears. He falls. The moon becomes a crescent. A spirit, in the form of a lady, appears from it. The astronomer chases her, but she eludes him. Now another figure stands in the crescent of the moon, before reclining into its C shape. The moon appears as a large face again, and the astronomer jumps into its mouth. a woman and Satan appears. The astronomer appears again. Then, in the observatory, the astronomer is sitting asleep in his chair.
