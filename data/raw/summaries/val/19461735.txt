Blaise Starrett  is a ruthless cattleman at odds with homesteaders in a small, bleak western town in Wyoming called Bitters. A feud develops between Starrett and a local farmer, Hal Crane, and the farmer's wife, Helen, agrees to renew a love affair with Starrett if he promises not to kill Hal. The feud is about to come to a bloody end when Jack Bruhn , and his band of thugs ride into town. They are on the run from the law after robbing a bank. He is a wounded outlaw, a former cavalry officer but that doesn't stop him and his gang holding the town's civilians hostage. Starrett must now find a way to save his town, and redeem himself in the process. He does so by helping the bad guys escape, or so they think, across the snow-covered mountains.
