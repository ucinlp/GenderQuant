At a manor in Sarajevo, Ra's al Ghul ruefully realizes his mistake in allying himself with the Joker, while his assistant informs him that the Joker has captured Robin. In a warehouse, the Joker brutally beats Robin with a crowbar while Batman races there. Joker then leaves the warehouse and traps a half-dead Robin inside. Although he attempts to escape, a planted explosive destroys the building, taking Robin with it as Batman arrives too late to save him. Five years later in Gotham City, a masked man known as Red Hood takes command of the drug trade, assuring eight prominent heads of the business protection from Batman and the crime lord Black Mask in return. The heads initially decline, but Red Hood tosses them a bag full of the heads of their lieutenants, easily changing their minds. Elsewhere, Batman intercepts a stolen truck carrying Amazo, an android weapon, and Nightwing arrives to help take it down. The drivers reveal they were under Red Hood’s orders before being assassinated by their employer. Batman gives chase and eventually ends up at the chemical plant that created the Joker, where Red Hood confronts him and comments that it is the place where Batman made his first great failure. Red Hood then escapes. Afterward, Batman and Nightwing interrogate Joker at Arkham Asylum for information; the clown merely taunts them with Robin’s death and denies involvement. Angered over his stolen android, Black Mask puts out a hit on Red Hood who promptly hijacks another weapon shipment, with Batman and Nightwing expectedly interrupting. During a chase over the city rooftops, Red Hood is seen to display exceptional physical skills, beyond those of a regular criminal and disturbingly similar to Batman and Nightwing's. Red Hood then eludes them at a train station, where a planted bomb explodes and Nightwing injures his leg in the process. Back at the Batcave, Bruce sends Dick home and then discovers Red Hood knows his secret identity. Bruce also recalls that Jason once used such escape maneuvers and also remembers that he became violent and impulsive as he grew older. On the streets, Red Hood is attacked by the Fearsome Hand of Four, a group of four assassins who had been hired by Black Mask as part of his efforts to take down the Red Hood. He stalls them to lure Batman out, and together they incapacitate three while Red Hood murders one. When Batman confronts him about it, Red Hood insists that he is taking criminals  out, doing what the Dark Knight is unwilling to do. Batman asked what happened to him and offers help, but is quickly rebuffed and Red Hood leaves. Bruce later uses a blood sample from the battle to confirm that Red Hood is in fact Jason Todd, back from the dead. Meanwhile, Red Hood fires a rocket-propelled grenade into Black Mask's office, nearly killing the crime lord. Pushed to his breaking point, Black Mask cuts a deal with the Joker: he will be released from Arkham in exchange for killing Red Hood. Bruce discovers the body in Jason’s coffin is indeed a fake. Enraged, he visits Ra's al Ghul – the man responsible – for the truth. Ra's reveals that five years previous he commissioned the Joker to distract the Dynamic Duo during their investigation into a terrorist plot committed by Ra's, but the clown kidnapped and murdered Robin, which Ra's saw as unnecessary and without cause. To make amends, Ra's chose not to make war with Batman anymore and secretly attempted to revive Jason in the Lazarus Pit, which yielded disastrous results: Jason came back wild and fled. Meanwhile, Joker abducts Black Mask and his associates, binding and gagging them but leaving Black Mask free to speak, to burn them alive in a lorry in a bid for Red Hood’s attention. Red Hood reveals his plan the whole time was to intimidate Black Mask into freeing Joker and arrange a meeting. Batman intervenes, saving the criminals, but Red Hood gets away with a captured Joker in tow. Red Hood takes Joker to an abandoned apartment and vengefully beats Joker with a crowbar in the same manner as Joker did to him years ago. He then meets Batman in Crime Alley, where they first met. There, they fight, and when the fight is taken to a rooftop, Red Hood is unmasked and is indeed Jason, who insists that he is a better vigilante because of his willingness to control crime and kill. Batman tells him he’ll never be better that way and the fight continues into the apartment where Joker is stored. When Jason holds Batman at gunpoint, Batman expresses his guilt over the incident. Jason forgives him, but is angry that Batman still lets the Joker live. Batman says that although he’s thought every day about killing Joker, he can’t, because he knows if he starts killing, he’ll never stop. Dissatisfied with the answer, Jason gives Batman a gun and an ultimatum by demanding he choose between them: either Jason will shoot the Joker, or Batman has to shoot Jason to stop him. Batman silently declines participation, drops the gun, and walks away. Distraught, Jason aims his gun at his former mentor before it is quickly disabled. Jason, defeated and purposeless, activates a bomb, and slumps to the ground in resignation. Batman knocks the Joker aside to try and save Jason as the explosive goes off. When the smoke clears, the Joker and Batman are revealed to have survived, but Jason is nowhere to be found. In the aftermath of the incident, a news report reveals that Joker was returned to Arkham and Black Mask is back on the streets after paying a million dollars bail, albeit under investigation for Joker's escape; Nightwing and Ra's watch the report, the latter brooding on the recent events that he caused. At the Batcave, Alfred asks Bruce if he should take down the memorial holding Jason’s old Robin costume in the Batcave due to recent events. Bruce refuses, saying nothing has changed. A final memory shows Jason’s first day as Robin, and the young boy declares happily that it is the best day of his life.
