 The prologue mysteriously states that at the dawn of time there was man and nature. Then men bearing crosses drove the heathens to the fringes of the earth. A mysterious mute Norse warrior only known as One-Eye , is held captive up above in misty highlands by a Chieftain , where he is forced to fight to the death against other captives. While One-Eye is imprisoned, a young boy tends to him regularly, bringing him food and water. One-Eye is shown to have the ability to foresee events in his dreams; a dream of him bathing in a pond leads him to discover an arrowhead on the bottom of a bed of water. Using the arrowhead, he breaks free, slaughters everyone except for The Boy and a warrior whom he lets escape. As One-Eye kills the last of his slavers the man shouts angrily at One-Eye that he will go back to hell. He finds the chieftain and places his head on a nithing pole, a magical rite Norse pagans used to place a curse upon someone.  While leaving the land, One-Eye soon realizes that The Boy is pursuing him. They reach a small group of Crusaders, Christians fresh from killing and enslaving pagans as they get ready to go on a crusade to Jerusalem. The leader of the group, The General , asks One-Eye to join him. He reasons that, live or die, One-Eye may cleanse his soul of sin by committing to the Crusades. The General, who has been told that The Boy has been a slave, asks him what he wants to now do and The Boy tells him he wishes to go home, but he does not know where home is. The General asks The Boy if he knows about One-Eye's origin. The Boy tells him that One-Eye was brought up from hell which, he has been told, lies on the other side of the ocean. It is left untold if he is talking about the Christian hell or hel: the underworld of Norse mythology.  The Crusaders, The Boy, and One-Eye are on a boat destined for Jerusalem. The crew is broken, thirsty and hungry, and with no wind for several days. A thick fog shrouds them constantly, preventing them from determining their direction or location. Lost, the crew begins to believe that the voyage is cursed, which some attribute to the presence of One-Eye's companion, The Boy. Mutiny nearly arises as a crew member who attempts to murder The Boy is killed by One-Eye. Later, sensing a change, One-Eye takes a drink from the water and discovers that the boat is actually in an estuary and no longer at sea. With the fog dissipating, the crew sees the first sight of land off in the distance.  Upon landing, to their surprise, the Holy Land is not the half-dry place they expected the Near East to be. Rather, it resembles a taiga with vast forests full of lakes and mountains. The crew sets out to explore the area, finding no animals to hunt, and no food to eat. Nearly starved, the crew continues until coming across some aboriginal burial sites. One of the crew members  leaves the group to venture on his own. The group searches for him for hours and some blame One-Eye as his killer. The General reasons that there is no proof of One-Eye killing him. Realizing they have not reached Jerusalem, the crew prepares the ship to depart and head home. While on water, the group is taunted by a single arrow, killing one of their men. Terrified, they soon come to believe that they are in Hell.  Upon reaching a nearby shore, the men drink a psychotropic brew given to them by their leader. One-Eye's dreams begin to intensify. He wades to a small island to construct a cairn. Meanwhile, the other men separate experiencing a variety of emotions, including apathy, desperation and despair. Some pray, others wander, others wait. One-Eye and the group are then confronted by a lost crew member who emerges from the forest naked and his skin covered in mud in which runes are drawn. The Lost One says he can hear One-Eye's thoughts, and translates that the warrior is saying they are in Hell. One of the crew members has become completely disillusioned and accuses The General of lying to him. He then declares there is no God and proceeds to attack One-Eye. One-Eye kills him and several other crew members who attack him.  Arrows from the forest continue to taunt and kill those left behind, soon after the band breaks up. As the priest ([[Gary Lewis leaves to follow One-Eye, the General stabs him and declares that he will stay and create a new Jerusalem. The Lost One laughs at him. The wounded priest and the General's son , follow One-Eye to the top of a tall hill. The Priest sits down. After talking to One-Eye, the General's son goes back to his father knowing the man is probably dead and that he too will die. As One-Eye leaves, The Boy looks at The Priest, expecting him to follow. The Priest stays behind, giving the boy a warm smile and knowing the child will be safe with One-Eye. The Priest is mortally wounded, seen with flies buzzing nearby, viewing the valley landscape, when an aura of light surrounds him. One-Eye and The Boy successfully reach the coastline and are soon met by a large tribe of Native American  warriors. One-Eye regards them from the distance then dropping his weapons walks towards them. They beat him to death. As One-Eye dies he recalls the cairn he built and while slowly submerging beneath the water he realizes his fate. The tribe allows The Boy to live and they then venture back into the forest. The Boy  looks off to the coast and enters into a dream sequence which has One-Eye looking back at him.
