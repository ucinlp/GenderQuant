Tagline: "Which one is your depravation?" Eight stories ranging from the story of a woman who awakes at an unknown person's apartment to the rejoining of two underground lovers. From the warm flirtings of two women to a girl captive in an elevator. Other stories are tied among these: a female teacher who is flirted by one of her students; a teenager's deception that joins again with her best friend from secondary school: the adventure of two porn actors who find love, and the amusing plans of a single man who just wishes to be kind with his old mother... From the producer and director of Todo el poder, and Cero y van cuatro, Fernando Sari√±ana.
