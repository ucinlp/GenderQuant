In a parody of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, the short opens with a voice-over by Bugs explaining that strange carrots have traveled from outer space to Earth. In the first scene, Bugs wakes up in his rabbit hole and remarks that he is late for work. His "work" consists of performing routines with Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, and Daffy Duck. During the routines, there is a strange pile of glowing carrots in the background, but Bugs ignores them. The next day, Bugs wakes up and returns to work, but Elmer, Yosemite Sam, and Daffy Duck appear as poorly-drawn versions of themselves with strangely friendly attitudes which Bugs finds exasperating. In each of Bugs' routines, they offer him a carrot. After two offers, Bugs accepts the carrot from Daffy but decides to eat it later. Back home, Bugs can't sleep, so he tries to figure out why Elmer, Sam, and Daffy appear so different, the carrot produces a poorly drawn version of Bugs. The impostor attempts to kill the real Bugs with an axe and Bugs runs off screaming . The typical "That's All Folks!" scene plays, but Bugs interrupts, claiming he must get to the bottom of the mystery. He finds tags on Elmer, Sam, and Daffy indicating that the impostors were made on the planet "Nudnik", and realizes he must get rid of them to get the original characters back. He collects the now malfunctioning "pale stereotypes" into a sack and fires them into space, and they get sucked into a black hole which swallows the impostors. The following morning, Bugs wakes up to find all of his enemies are back to normal. After the credits, an impostor Porky Pig pops out of the Looney Tunes drum. Trying to utter the line "That's All, Folks!" Bugs throws out the impostor and drags in the real Porky Pig, placing him inside the drum. Porky chuckles and then says his line.
