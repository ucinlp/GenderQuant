Jim Dodge  is a self-proclaimed "people person" and dreamer who is perceived as lazy, good for nothing. After being fired from numerous low-paying jobs, Jim is given the choice by his father, Bud Dodge , to either land a job at the local Target or be put on a bus to St. Louis. Jim is hired as Night Cleanup Boy at Target. On his first shift at his new job, Jim is locked, alone, in the store by his boss. The good news is that he encounters Josie McClellan , the stereotypical "spoiled rich girl," who is someone he has known all his life in school, where they were worlds apart. Josie had spent the past several hours asleep in a dressing room after backing out of shoplifting some merchandise in a half-hearted attempt to run away from her abusive father, Roger Roy McClellan . Josie and Jim begin to connect with each other, realising they are not so different, and Josie convinces Jim to run away with her. They begin to form a romantic relationship, and proceed to enjoy the freedom of having a store this size to themselves. However, things become complicated when two incompetent crooks, Nestor Pyle and Gil Kinney , break into the store and hold the two hostage.
