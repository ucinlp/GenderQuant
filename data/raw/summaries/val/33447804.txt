The story starts with a galleon sailing across the ocean. On it, Krazy is a seaman whose routines include mopping the main deck. After cleaning, he goes for a stroll around the vessel. As he continues moving, Krazy accidentally bumps into the captain who is quite irritable. The captain starts chasing Krazy, only to slip on a soap bar and get airborne. Very quickly, the other seamen came in and cushioned his fall. Remembering how unpleasantly ill-tempered their leader is, however, the seamen hurled the captain off the ship's side where he plunges into the water. Following that, they and Krazy began to celebrate the deed with some music and dancing. In a kitchen levelled with the main deck, an Oriental chef was trying to fry fish on skillets but notices the place was short in supply. The chef came outside and orders Krazy to do some fishing. Krazy takes a pole and casts a line. Moments later, something was caught, and Krazy starts to reel in. It turns out what was pulled in was the captain. Not very happy with the result, the chef throws a punch at Krazy but the cat ducked, and instead the captain was the one struck. The captain then hits back in a similar fashion. For the rest of the film, the captain and the chef punched each other repeatedly and Krazy was enjoying the sight.
