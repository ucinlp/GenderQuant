Filmed in roughly one month between the end of October and the beginning of December 2005, Mr. Sell's film is an honest portrayal of 'Defend New Orleans' creator Jac Currie’s life after Hurricane Katrina and one of his first trips back to the Gulf Coast after being stranded in New York. It shows Defend New Orleans’ transition to a valid social aid project and features some of the earliest produced footage of post-Katrina Mississippi Gulf Coast and New Orleans. 'No Place Like Home' features a moving soundtrack made by musicians personally connected with the subjects and interviews with friends who survived Katrina in New Orleans. All proceeds from DVD sales go directly towards Gulf Coast restoration funds.
