Dianne  works as a part-time tutor for the Gonzales', the owners of a local funeral parlor, which is said to be the lair of rumored "aswangs". On her first day, she met the patriarch Carlo , the children - Ryan  and Sarah  -, the family's butlers Aludia  and Simeon , and the secretary Anna . After a series of successful tutorial sessions, it gradually became clear to Dianne the nature of the family: being photophobic, having a desire for human entrails, and, worst of all, the unusual activity in and out of the parlor. Dennis , Dianne's brother, dismissed his sister's stories; meanwhile, Ryan was accused of divulging the truth to Dianne, creating a tension between Carlo and the tutor. However, Dianne could not brought herself to quit, not only because of being friendly attached to Ryan, but also this was her only work for a living. As a plot, the family lured Dennis, who was waiting for her sister outside. Unknown to him, he was used as a bait to force Diane continue her work, but at the same time, sacrificing her life as prey to the "aswangs". Carlo then revealed that they were once part of an ancient tribe, whose homes were ravaged by fire. Desperate, he Carlo, being widowed, and his family set up the funeral parlor to cover up their true nature and to earn for a living. This explained their photophobic features and the fact of dismissing Dianne every evening before sundown. Dianne confronted the group, demanding they surrender Dennis. Throwing formaldehyde and setting the parlor aflame as a diversion, Dianne and her brother narrowly escaped Sarah's and Carlo's assaults, while Ryan begged to go with her. Left with no choice, Dianne brought Ryan home, as the funeral parlor burned to the ground. As Dianne finds the first-aid kit to treat Dennis, she overhears his screams. She rushes to the den and finds Ryan who was revealed to be an aswang himself, eating Dennis' entrails. Although unnoticed, he has desire on eating living people with his family during his birthday rather than eating corpses like his foster family. Dianne realizes that she was deceived for being friends with Ryan as he growls and pounces on her.
