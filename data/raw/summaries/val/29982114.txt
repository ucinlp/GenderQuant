This is a single handed war on terrorism. Commando in the Indian Army Bharath considers his nation as his mother. He does not want anyone to cut it like piece of cake. He is very strong and stubborn in his decision. Captain Bharath is Salim, Captain Bharath is Jai Hind. In his first assignment to trace or trash the terrorist operation he round off terrorist Masood and hand over to the government of India. He gets Shourya Chakra for it. In a short span of time Masood is freed on a hijack of an Indian Air plane with Rs.200 crores demand set by terrorist gang. Feeling ashamed of this, Captain Bharath in his second assignment takes his own decision. He seeks the support of his doctor wife Anjali  in declaring him as dead. As Salim and as Jai Hind, Captain Bharath now with a clue of terrorist attack in prominent places in Bangalore put an end to terrorist activities and surrenders to the government. For taking law in to his hand Captain Bharath is sentenced for life imprisonment. The public support Captain Bharath but judiciary is above all.
