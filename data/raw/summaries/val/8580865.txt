Indian-born Manmohan Malhotra  re-located to London, England, established himself, returned to India, got married to Bebo , and after four years got a visa for her so that she could live with him. Shortly thereafter, she gave birth to Jasmeet . Manmohan was always embarrassed by Bebo as she was fat and could not speak English. As a result, he always left her out of important occasions, while he socialized. Bebo did not want Jasmeet to end up like her, so she got her educated in an English school, encouraged to mingle with British friends, and Jasmeet was transformed in to Jazz &mdash; a beautiful young woman, modern in looks, talk, habits, and heart. Her father had set her to meet a young lad, Bobby Bedi , though the date turns out to be a disaster and Bobby rejects her. Manmohan thinks that it is impossible to get him a Indian son-in-law, although his friend, Parvez Khan , is in a similar situation with his son, Imran , who has a blonde girlfriend, Susan . Manmohan takes his family for a tour in India and forces Jasmeet to marry Arjun Singh . On their return to London, Jasmeet announces that she is getting married to Charlie Brown , who is well educated and has good friends and connections, even with Prince Charles. She refuses to recognize her marriage with Arjun as there is no proof of the wedding. When Jasmeet is introduced to the friends of the Brown family, she is subjected to considerable racist abuse  as well as a quote from Winston Churchill: 'When we leave India, the country will be in the hands of goons'. During this period, Jazz becomes close with Arjun who still supports her. Charlie Brown then has a rugby match against the Indians and Arjun, the English lose and Brown is verbally racist to the Indians. While Imran is asked by Susan's parents to leave Islam, become a Christian, change his name to Emmanuel or Ian, as well as provide a written proof that his family is not associated with terrorists. The film ends on a happy note with Imran, not turns to be a Christian and Susan being accepted with Imran's family; Jazz realizes her love for Arjun runs away from her wedding to Charlie Brown and goes with Arjun back to India where they are seen riding Arjun's motorcycle.
