After having robbed a bank for $100,000 in gold bars, Dan Hogan  and his gang meet up at the Jackal's Ranch stage coach weigh station near the Mexican border, where Hogan's girlfriend Eleanor  is to surreptitiously bring their stolen gold to them. While they await her arrival, they encounter John Webb , a stranger who had shot the man who was to be their guide and who himself wants half their gold in exchange for leading them secretly into Mexico. Hogan agrees and the group takes off through the desert with the law close behind.
