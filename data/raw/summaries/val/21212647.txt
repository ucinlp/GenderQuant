October 18, 2012. During a party at the American Embassy in Berlin, German scientist Gregor Starndorf is told that the comet he discovered, designated Bay-Leder 7, is headed towards Earth. It is large enough to cause mass-extinction and is only days away. He works with the U.S. Army in developing a satellite weapon called SolStar-2, which is used against the comet with moderate success: although the microwave beam cut Bay-Leder 7 in two, the smaller part impacts in West Russia. The head of security, Captain Tom Parker picks up his wife and daughter to evacuate by plane. However, his superior, Colonel Waters, forces Parker to leave them behind, watching helplessly as the plane took off. News reports depict the aftereffects of the impact. Three years later, the situation is still grim. Due to the debris thrown into the atmosphere, all of Europe was evacuated to Africa, where a new ruling body, the New United Northern States , has been established. Oil prices also skyrocketed, enabling the Middle East to establish a firm grip on the world economy. A NUNS technician finds that SolStar-2 is still active. But the satellite can only be controlled from the command center below the Reichstag. Berlin is in the middle of the "death zone", uninhabitable areas because of the cold. A plane was sent to investigate, but it suddenly exploded. Everything pointed to SolStar-2 in the attack. NUNS President Miranda Harrison recruits Parker to lead an expedition—including ex-SAS Sarah Henley and Anna Starndorf,Gregor Starndorf's daughter—in order to find out who controls the satellite and destroy it. Although Parker knows the mission is led by Colonel Waters, he ask to join, secretly hoping that his family is somehow alive. During their flight in the SolStar-2 zeroes in on their position and destroys the plane. The team manages to parachute out with two APCs, though. During the trip, they must cross through Cologne and use the Cologne Cathedral as a guide there. However, they lose several men to marauders and one APC to an ice geyser. When they finally reach Berlin, they find that the city is buried in several meters of snow. Shortly afterwards, they came under attack from survivors. There are about 600 people hiding in the subway tunnels and supplied by the "Distributors". They find out a blind man called "the doctor" is hiding below the Reichtag and supplies the people with food. The doctor's quarters is actually a verdant greenhouse and he is Gregor Starndorf. He explains that he and his chief engineer Klaus Hintze were the designers of SolStar-2. It was originally meant to be a new power source to lessen the dependency on oil, but due to military funding, it became a weapon. He ordered Hintze to reactivate the satellite as he designed a method to extend its area of effect and stop the permanent winter. He is alarmed to hear Hintze is using it as a weapon, but the Distributors suddenly return and during the battle a sniper kills him. Enraged, the four confronts Hintze, who is powering up the satellite to destroy Tangier, the NUNS' headquarter city, as a revenge for having been left behind. Sarah shoots him and Col. Waters apologizes to Parker for his earlier actions and allows him to leave and find his family. While he is away, Sarah unexpectedly kills Waters and orders Anna to retarget SolStar-2 to the Middle East. Parker returns and, despite being wounded, attacks Sarah, nearly losing before Anna shoots her. Anna aims the satellite to Europe and executes her father's program, causing SolStar-2 to use up its last energy reserves to release a massive, wide-beamed microwave torrent which begins warming the atmosphere. Parker and Anna continue the search for his family and find his home. Inside he discovers his wife's final message to him beside their frozen bodies. Back outside, they watch the thick, permanent clouds over Germany dissipate, revealing the warming sun once again.
