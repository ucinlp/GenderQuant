Cocky Tommy Connors  is sentenced from 5 to 30 years in Sing Sing for robbery and assault with an automatic weapon. His associate, Joe Finn , promises to use his contacts and influence to get him freed long before that, but his attempt to bribe the warden to provide special treatment is met with disdain and failure. Connors makes trouble immediately, but several months confined to his cell changes his attitude somewhat. As the warden had predicted, Connors is only too glad to do some honest work on the rockpile after his enforced inactivity. Nonetheless, his determination to break out is unshaken. Bud Saunders , a highly educated fellow prisoner, recruits him and Hype  for a complicated escape attempt. By chance, however, it is scheduled for a Saturday, which Connors superstitiously regards as always unlucky for him. He backs out, forcing Saunders to take another volunteer. The warden is tipped off and, though two guards are killed, the escape is foiled. Trapped, Saunders jumps to his death. His two accomplices are captured and returned to his cells. Meanwhile, Connors' girlfriend, Fay Wilson , visits him regularly in the prison since the court. On one visit, she admits she has become friendly and close to Finn in order to encourage him to help Connors, but Connors tells her that she is only giving Finn a reason to keep him locked up in jail. The warden shows Connors a telegragm which says that Wilson was injured in a car accident; there is no hope for her. Then, he gives Connors a 24 hour leave to see her; Connors promises to return, no matter what. When he sees Wilson, he learns that Finn was responsible for her injuries. He takes out a gun from a drawer, but Wilson persuades him to give her the pistol. Finn shows up, however, expecting her to sign a statement exonerating him in exchange for $5000 she intended to give to Connors. Connors attacks him. When it seems that Finn is about to kill her boyfriend, Wilson shoots him. Connors flees, taking the gun with him; Wilson secretly slips the money into his pocket. Before he dies, Finn names Connors as his killer. The warden is lambasted in the newspapers for letting Connors go. Just when he is about to sign a letter of resignation, Connors walks in. He is found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to the electric chair, despite a recovered Wilson's testimony that she killed Finn. Connors comforts her before being taken to Death row.
