Rohit meets Chandni at a wedding of his relative, and falls instantly in love with her. He pursues her relentlessly until she agrees to date him, and eventually they become engaged to be married. His family is very much against this because of the differences in their social status, but Rohit doesn't care. One day, Rohit calls Chandni and asks her to wait for him on the terrace of her house, which she does. As she's waiting the afternoon's silence is broken by the roaring blades of a helicopter and there in the sky Rohit appears who proceeds to shower Chandni in red rose petals. He disappears from her vision and she is once again surrounded by silence, though this time she has an unnerving feeling something has happened. Seconds later, Chandni hears the phone ringing and runs to it with trembling excitement knowing it is Rohit. It is not and she is given the news that Rohit is in hospital. Faced with stony expressions of Rohit's family in the hospital she is instantly accused of being the reason why Rohit fell from the helicopter. From there the family's animosity continues towards Chandni as Rohit is paralysed on his right side and his family continues to berate her. Finally, Rohit too berates her, which is too much for her to bear. Chandni, intent on erasing every memory of Rohit, decides to move to Mumbai in order to turn over a new leaf. She starts working for a travel agency which is headed by Lalit, a handsome and charming man, who like Chandni, has a heartache of his own. In a short space of time he falls in love with Chandni and asks her to marry him. She dwells on this question and finally says yes to the exultation of both himself and his mother. Coincidentally Lalit, on a business trip in Switzerland, meets Rohit who is there to receive treatment for his paralysis and now no longer needs the wheelchair. The men tell each other their stories and sing with joy of love, not knowing they are both singing about the same girl. Back in India Rohit shows up one evening at Chandni's door and to her utter amazement he stands up and does a little dance. Both are so overwrought with emotion at seeing each other again that Rohit proposes to her. Chandni remembers Lalit and informs Rohit she now belongs to someone else. Rohit becomes angry, to which Chandni asks him what he would have done if he were in her place? Rohit regrets the episode and leaves. As Rohit and Lalit had become such good friends in Switzerland, Lalit invited his friend to his wedding and prior to this day Lalit invites Chandni to meet this new friend. Rohit and Chandni pretend to be strangers to spare Lalit. On the day of the wedding, Rohit under the influence of alcohol, stumbles down a flight of stairs leading to the wedding procession. The fall results in a hysterical Chandni screaming for Rohit to be saved and as Lalit looks on he realises that Chandni belongs to Rohit and she was the person Rohit was singing about in Switzerland. In the end, he lets Chandni go to be with Rohit.
