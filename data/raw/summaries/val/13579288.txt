Slowly the husbands are running out of money so they trick their wives and go out for a vacation. Meanwhile their wives are struggling to pay their rents and decide to work even though their husbands told them not to. When the husbands come back, they kick their wives out of the house since they got jobs. The wives go to live with Jhoomri and Bhishma.
