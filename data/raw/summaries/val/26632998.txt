The film incorporates characters and events from several of the albums, in particular the first, "Adèle and the Beast," first published in 1976, and the fourth, 1978's "Mummies on Parade," While experimenting with the telepathic techniques he has been researching, Professor Espérandieu hatches a 136 million year-old pterosaur egg within the Galerie de paléontologie et d'anatomie comparée, resulting in the death of a former prefect  which though witnessed only by the then-drunk Choupard sparks an epidemic of claimed sightings of the creature. The President of France orders the case be considered of utmost urgency by the National Police, only for it to be handed down to the bumbling Inspector Léonce Caponi. Adèle Blanc-Sec, a journalist and travel writer of some fame, finds herself involved after returning from Egypt, where she was searching for Ramesses II's mummified doctor. She wants to revive the mummy with the help of Espérandieu so the doctor can save her sister Agathe, who is comatose following an unfortunate tennis incident involving a hatpin. After a brief struggle with her arch nemesis, the mysterious Professor Dieuleveut, she retrieves the mummy and returns home. Her mission is complicated further by Esperandiue being on death row, having been blamed for the pterosaur's attacks in lieu of Inspector Caponi and celebrity big game hunter Justin de Saint-Hubert having any success in taking down the beast itself. The mummy ends up being the Pharaoh's Nuclear physicist  and is unable to help her sister medically. He does, however, accompany Adèle to the Musée du Louvre, where they revive the rest of the Pharaoh's mummified court on display there, including the Pharaoh himself. The Pharaoh's doctor uses their advanced medical techniques to revive Agathe. The Pharaoh then decides he wants to see Paris, so the entire court wanders out into the night, scaring the ever-hapless Choupard yet again. Adèle decides she needs a vacation to relax. The final scene shows her boarding a ship, only to be annoyed by some boisterous children. Professor Dieuleveut appears, as the viewpoint pulls back the name of the ship is revealed, the RMS Titanic.
