Three girls from Milan dreaming of a holiday in Rome arrive in the city by train and decide to pretend to be wealthy Danish girls to attract three good looking young men who offer them a guided tour through the landmarks of the city. The girls accept and make the guys spend a fortune, but one evening they get drunk and one of them incidentally reveals they are not Danish and are only from Milan. The guys get upset and plan their revenge, but in the end they make it up.
