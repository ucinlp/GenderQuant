Lieut. Bill Brannigan  invites friend and hotshot pilot Tommy O'Toole , the self-styled "world's greatest aviator", to join the USMC Reserve Aviator training program. O'Toole arrives and promptly starts to move in on Brannigan's love interest, Betty Roberts , and in typical cocky fashion, antagonizes nearly everyone else. Although not temperamentally suited for the military, O'Toole completes primary training and after surviving an accident, eventually realizes that he is willing to change. After a competition in the air with his friend Brannigan, and for the attentions of Betty, there is a predictable conclusion with O'Toole coming out the victor. The film has a Warner Bros. tribute to the Navy Department, to the officers and men of the Marine Corps and the fleet for their invaluable co-operation.With a limited budget, the assistance of the military was critical.
