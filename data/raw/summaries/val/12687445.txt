In a presidential election set somewhere in the near future, Bud Johnson , a lovable loser from Texico, New Mexico, who is coasting through life and hasn't a single political thought in his head, is thrust into an improbable dilemma. In response, he is coaxed by his 12-year-old daughter Molly  to take more of a serious approach to life. Molly runs the household and sees an opportunity on election day to energize her father. Molly, frustrated with her father's apathy toward voting, sneaks into her local polling place and tries to vote on behalf of Bud. However, due to the voting machines being unplugged, the ballot is registered, but there is no decision on which candidate gets the vote. The entire election comes down to this one man and, namely, Bud's vote. Neither candidate has a majority in the electoral college without New Mexico's electoral votes. The popular vote is tied for the two major candidates in New Mexico, leaving Bud to decide the next President of the United States. Bud gets wooed by candidates from both sides: the incumbent Republican, Andrew Carington Boone , and his campaign manager, Martin Fox ; and the opposing Democrat, Vermont Senator Donald Greenleaf .

In the end, he chooses to hold a final debate the day before he is set to recast his ballot. In a written speech, he confesses that he knows little to nothing about politics or, for that matter, life, and decides to ask questions people have sent to him in the mail. The movie ends with Bud casting his vote, though it is never revealed for whom he voted.
