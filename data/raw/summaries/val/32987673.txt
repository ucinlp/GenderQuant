An Englishman is wrongly accused of a crime and flees to Australia. On the boat over he saves the life of a squatter's daughter when she falls overboard. In gratitude, the girl's father gives him a job on his station. The Englishman falls in love with the girl and they get engaged to be married. However he faces opposition from the station manager, who causes trouble for them. The climax involves a bushfire and "ride for life".Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900â€“1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, p 34{{cite news}}
