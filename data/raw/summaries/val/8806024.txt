The Christmas preparations are under way at the wealthy Bals family farm. Everyone is busy getting ready for days of season celebrations when a message arrives that puts an immediate damper on the festivities; Magistrate Bals' cranky old sister - nicknamed "tante Pose"  - has announced her arrival at the farm. The aunt and old grandpa Bals can't stand each other and from the moment she shows her face there is a state of war between the two, seriously complicating the family celebrations. The movie was a huge hit in Norwegian movie-theaters in 1940 and has since grown to become a staple of Norwegian Christmas traditions, being shown on television every Christmas.
