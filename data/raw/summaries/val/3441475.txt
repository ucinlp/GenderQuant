The experimental X-15 program at Edwards Air Force Base involves test pilots: civilian Matt Powell , Lt. Col. Lee Brandon  and Maj. Ernest Wilde . The cutting edge high-speed program is ramrodded by project chief Tom Deparma  and US Air Force Col. Craig Brewster . As the test pilots prepare for the planned launch of the rocket plane from a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress mother ship, they experience emotional and physical problems, which they share with their wives and sweethearts. Test after test results in setbacks, including a near disaster when an engine explodes during a ground test and engulfs the X-15 and its pilot in flames, but finally the X-15 begins to set records in speed and altitude for a piloted aircraft. When the X-15 "flames out" on a high altitude run, after guiding the X-15 to a safe landing, saving Powell's life, Lt. Col. Brandon, flying a chase plane, is killed in a crash. Powell himself takes the X-15 into outer space for the final test.
