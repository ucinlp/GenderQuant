The film follows Morag Gunn from her tough childhood in Manitoba through to middle-age—all the while showing Morag's search for love. Along the way, we meet various characters from the Manawaka series and catch a glimpse into the many ways that society creates outcasts. The film also explores mythology, as shown through Christie's Scottish Piper Gunn, Métis hero Jules Tonnerre, Morag's novel and songs by Skinner and Piquette. As Margaret Laurence's crowning achievement, The Diviners shows that truth and love can be "divined" in many ways.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106734/
