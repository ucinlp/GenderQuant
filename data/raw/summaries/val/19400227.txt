Spanky has been entered into a kiddie amateur show by his pushy stage mother, who thinks he is the greatest actor of his day. Spanky wants nothing to do with this and would rather not act at all. The gang comes up with a plan to disrupt his recitation with peashooters and noisemakers and make him flop. At the theater, Spanky befriends a little girl  who has bombed her act due to stage fright but needs the prize money to buy a special dress. Spanky has a change of heart and decides to win the prize and give the money to the girl. However, word does not get out the gang, who are in the audience prepared to embarrass Spanky any way they can.
