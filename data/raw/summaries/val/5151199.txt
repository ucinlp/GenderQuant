For his first full-length film, CÃ©dric Klapisch relates the story of a Parisian department store through its employees. A new director, Monsieur Lepetit, is named at the head of the company so as to save it from bankruptcy. To this end, he decides to create a company spirit with group psychotherapy, bungee jumping and other tricks. In this first film Klapisch's main purpose was to show the difference between the behavior of a person when he is alone and when he is in a group. In order to show this, he filmed the employees during their commute, at work and in other scenes of daily life, which made Klapisch style's reputation. This topic will become recurrent in many of his films. At the end of the film he succeeds in saving the company, nevertheless the store is sold to build a hotel. This theme is still of topicality today and makes this film interesting although it is 15 years old.
