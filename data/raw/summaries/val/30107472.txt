Two hip-hop rappers, A-Maze and Young Eastie, are both struggling in a twenty-four hour time frame in Miami, Florida. Young Eastie is an up-and-coming rapper with big dreams of making music; on the other hand, A-Maze, who already has the fame, is a rapper gone sour with bad press and a change in his fan base. Eastie is working on his music, also working at a fast-food restaurant, selling marijuana out of the window. He and his friend/producer Jay, portrayed by Lil' Scrappy manage to get an interview with A-Maze, which gives Eastie a chance to give him his demo. A-Maze's bodyguard shoots a fellow musician during a club party, which sends the media hounding for his head. The shooting causes his career to go belly-up overnight, and presses his contractor, portrayed by Big Daddy Kane to release his album to capitalize on his temporary limelight. In the meantime, Eastie and A-Maze's rivals  come after both Eastie and A-Maze to keep them quiet about the simultaneous shootings which took place the night before, slowing both of them down before the end of the night.
