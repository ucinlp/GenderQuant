Private investigator Lew Harper's marriage to Susan is in trouble and he doesn't have many friends, but one of them, mild-mannered attorney Albert Graves, brings him a case. Ralph Sampson, the millionaire husband of hard-boiled, physically disabled  Elaine Sampson is missing. Ralph, worth $20 million, is described by most as money-driven, crazy, alcoholic and egotistical. Elaine doesn't seem to even like him and believes he is off with a woman. She just wants to know where he is so that she can, as she states, outlive him. Harper's first stop is to see Sampson's spoiled but seductive daughter, Miranda, and her amiable casual boyfriend Alan Taggert, who is the missing man's private pilot. A photo of a glamorous starlet in Sampson's belongings leads to Fay Estabrook, who is now an overweight alcoholic. Harper gets her drunk and drives her home to see if there is any evidence at her house linking her to Sampson's disappearance. While she is passed out, he intercepts a phone call meant for her. He pretends to be the "Troy" the caller believes. The caller, named Betty, talks about reports that Fay was seen earlier in the evening with a stranger - that being Harper - and that they need to be careful. When Harper mentions Ralph Sampson, Betty knows that she is not speaking to Troy. After Harper hangs up on her, Troy comes out from the woodwork. He is Fay's husband, Dwight Troy, who kicks Harper out of the house at gunpoint. Harper tracks down "Betty" - Betty Fraley, a lounge singer, and not a very good one, with a nasty drug habit. After she asks him about Ralph, she recognizes his voice from the telephone. After Harper threatens to turn her over to the narcotics squad seeing as to the fresh track marks on her arm, Betty admits she knows Sampson, but only casually as a drunk who comes into the bar. After Harper becomes relentless with his questions, Betty gets the bouncer, Puddler, to throw him out, but not until Puddler's had a chance to beat him. Taggert comes out of nowhere to rescue Harper by knocking Puddler out unconscious. Taggert had apparently been following leads himself which led him to the lounge. They head back to Fay's house to follow another lead mentioned in Betty's telephone call about a truck coming through, although Harper has no idea the importance of the truck. While Harper is inside Fay's house, he hears gunshots outside. Taggert spotted the truck and was trying to shoot the tires before it got away. Harper tries to run the truck down, but the truck tries to run Harper over before it speeds away. With Miranda, Harper next takes a trip up to the mountaintop temple of a religious cult led by Claude, a bogus holy man, to who Ralph gave the property for the cult's temple. Elaine receives a note from Ralph asking her to cash in $500,000 worth of bonds. She verifies the handwriting is his. After Albert cashes the bonds for her and puts the money in his safe, Elaine receives a ransom note telling them where to drop the money. Since the kidnapper seemed to know that they had the money in their possession, Harper figures the kidnapper has an inside source. Now with the police involved, they decide to make the ransom drop, at an oil site outside of town. There, the person who picked up the moneys is shot dead by someone driving a white sedan, who is able to drive off with the money. A matchbook in the dead man's pocket leads Harper to a seedy bar called The Corner. At The Corner, Harper learns the dead man's name is Eddie, is a regular and made a long distance call to Vegas three nights ago from the bar, the last time he was there. Outside, Harper spots the truck that earlier tried to run him over. Following the truck leads Harper back to the mountaintop temple. There, he uncovers a smuggling organization of illegal immigrants, run by Dwight, who uses Claude's temple as a front. Harper is captured by Dwight, Claude and their band of illegal immigrants. Harper is held captive and beaten, overseen by Puddler. Despite having his wrists tied together, Harper manages to kill the guard and escape. He comes home to Susan, who treats his wounds and makes love to him, but Harper runs out on her again the next day. He goes to Taggert on the pretense of borrowing a clean shirt, then taunts him into admitting he's in love with Betty and conspired with her to steal Mrs. Sampson's ransom payment. Taggert pulls a gun on Harper, who vows to let him go with the money if he does what he was hired to do: find Ralph Sampson. Taggert refuses and is ready to kill Harper. Graves saves the day at the last instant, bursting into the room and shooting Taggert from behind. After Harper tells Miranda the news, Miranda confesses that despite thinking Taggert attractive, she was not in love with him. She also admits hating her father. She considers herself cold and uncaring. Graves attempts to console Miranda about her newly confessed self-loathing. Harper goes looking for Betty and the money in Castle Beach, the beach front community where she and Taggert had their love nest. He is able to locate her by finding the white sedan parked outside one of the houses. He can hear inside that she is being tortured, her captors being Dwight, Claude and Fay who are trying to find out where she hid the money. He also overhears Betty telling them that the money is hidden in a deep freeze storage locker, the key in a box above the fireplace. Harper bursts in, shoots Dwight, slugs Claude, locks Fay in a closet and after he retrieves the key to the locker, helps a barely mobile Betty to escape. After Harper tells her - and proves - that the man she loved, Taggert, is dead, Betty tells him that the man she murdered at the ransom site, Eddie, was her brother, who was working for Dwight, Fay and Claude. She also tells him that Sampson is being held in an abandoned oil tanker. Harper calls Graves to tell him to meet them at the tanker. After they arrive at the tanker, Harper goes inside and is beaten over the head from behind, rendering him unconscious. Arriving at the scene, Graves is able to revive Harper. The person who beat Harper is nowhere in sight. They both end up finding Sampson, he who is now dead, presumed murdered by whoever beat Harper over the head. They also discover that Harper's car is gone. Betty has driven off with it, having learned hot-wiring skills from Eddie when they were kids. Using his intuition, Harper, with Graves in Graves' car, goes searching for Betty. They do end up spotting her driving along the highway. When she spots them behind her, a high speed chase along a narrow winding hillside road ensues. Hitting an unexpected construction crew around a bend in the road, Betty swerves and drives off the road down the hill. The accident kills her. Harper telephones Elaine regarding the news about her husband being dead. She takes the news matter of factly and with a sense of cynical happiness. Harper and Graves go to the deep freeze locker to retrieve the money, which is where Betty said it would be. As Harper and Graves drive to the Sampson estate in Graves' car to return the money, Harper confronts Graves with his suspicion: that Graves is the one who hit him from behind at the oil tanker and the one who killed Sampson. What gave Graves away was that if the person who beat him was part of the kidnapping gang, he would have searched him for the key to the locker. As such, Graves admits he did kill Sampson, a spur of the moment decision when the opportunity arose. He admits that he thought Sampson a cruel man, not only to him but to everyone. As an example, Sampson did try to push Graves into Miranda's arms when Sampson learned Graves was in love with her, but Graves knew Sampson would never give consent for him to marry her, and did it all just for his own amusement. Graves' consoling Miranda earlier that day pushed him over the edge with regard to his ill feelings for Sampson. Despite Graves telling him that no one will be sad about Sampson's death, Harper tells him that he has no choice but to turn him in. At the gate to the Sampson estate, Harper gets out of the car with the money, telling Graves he'll need to shoot him to stop him. But neither one is entirely sure what to do next.
