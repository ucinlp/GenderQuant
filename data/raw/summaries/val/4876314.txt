The story is based on the legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh , which disappears under the waters of a lake to escape an attack by the Mongols.  The film itself follows the legend only loosely, however, and its highpoint is a battle between the Russian soldiers and the Mongol hordes, symbolizing a clash of cultures .
