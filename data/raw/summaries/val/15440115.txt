{{plot}} The gang is putting on another big show in Spanky's cellar, complete with an orchestra led by Buckwheat , and planned performances by Darla  and many of the other neighborhood kids. However, "King of Crooners" Alfalfa , the intended star of the show, crashes the show full of swing music with his off-key rendition of "The Barber of Seville", having secretly decided that he's only going to sing opera from now on. After Spanky closes the curtain on Alfalfa and sends out another act to replace him, the would-be opera prodigy walks out on the show, taking his voice "where it'll be appreciated!" With Porky  as his right-hand man/hanger on, Alfalfa turns up at the Cosmopolitan Opera House, wanting to appear in their next opera. Barnaby ([[Henry Brandon , the impresario of the Cosmopolitan, jokingly offers the young boy a contract - provided he come back in twenty years. Elated, Alfalfa returns to Spanky's cellar with Porky, gloating about his presumed good fortune and illustrious future in the face of Spanky's pleas for Alfalfa to appease his customers and take the stage. Spanky tears into his best friend, telling him that "someday I'll be a big producer on Broadway, and you'll be singing your opera in the streets with a tin cup in your hand!" Alfalfa brushes off Spanky's warnings, and sits down to rest . Alfalfa falls asleep backstage, and dreams that the twenty years have elapsed and he and Porky are waiting at the steps of a Broadway opera house. Barnaby, now a wizened old man, has decorated Broadway with lighted signs heralding Alfalfa's opera debut, and invites Alfalfa in to perform. However, when the opera house curtains finally open, Alfalfa barely gets through a few bars of "The Barber of Seville" before the audience members begin to boo him and pelt him with rotten vegetables. An angry Barnaby literally throws Alfalfa out into the streets. Bound by the iron-clad contract he signed twenty years ago, Alfalfa is forced to sing for pennies in the cold, snowy streets of New York. Hungry, tired, and broke, Alfalfa and Porky happen upon a shocking sight several blocks away: "Club Spanky", an ornate nightclub on Broadway. Sure enough, Spanky himself, now rich and famous, rides up in a limousine to greet them, and graciously invites them inside for something to eat. Club Spanky is a child's dream fantasy of a New York nightclub, with decor derived from toy blocks and candy canes, and a menu which includes hamburgers, ice cream, and jellybeans. Darla, dressed in furs and diamonds, comes over to sit at Spanky's table. She tells Alfalfa that she performs at Club Spanky, and is now rich and making "hundreds and thousands of dollars." Alfalfa gets a second shock when he learns that Buckwheat  is still Spanky's bandleader, and is also rich, dripping with diamonds, and making "hundreds and thousands of dollars." Spanky offers to let Alfalfa and Porky work for him again; Porky immediately accepts the offer, but the stubborn Alfalfa declares himself "a slave to my art" and refuses to "croon". Instead, Alfalfa sits and watches Club Spanky's lavish floor show, with featured songs by Spanky, Darla, Buckwheat, Porky, and several other performers, supported by large, ornate sets and scores of dancers. At the show's conclusion, Alfalfa finds himself so impressed with the show that he decides to go back to "crooning". Spanky announces the return of the "King of Crooners" to a rapturous crowd, but before Alfalfa can begin to sing, Barnaby storms into the club, and begins to drag Alfalfa back out into the streets to sing opera. By now, Alfalfa is complaining that he doesn't want to sing opera anymore, but Barnaby only laughs and continues to drag Alfalfa towards the door. The Club Spanky patrons' cries of "we want Alfalfa" melt into those of the kids in Spanky's cellar. Alfalfa awakens to find Spanky, not Barnaby, tugging at his arm, begging for Alfalfa to at least join in the last act and croon for the kids. Alfalfa needs no further convincing, and rushes onstage with Spanky, Porky, Darla, and the other kids to sing Bing Crosby's "Learn to Croon" for the show's finale.
