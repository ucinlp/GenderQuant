Steven McKray , a marine biologist, travels to a small African fishing village to investigate a series of violent shark attacks, only to discover that sharks are not the only problem. This movie features very few on-screen shark attacks. However, an attack on a tourist dangling her leg in the water is very realistic and in line with documented shark attacks. Instead of the shark taking off her whole leg, it takes out a large chunk of flesh, which later required surgical amputation.
