In 1825, in the village of Pietranera in French-controlled Corsica, hot-blooded maiden Colomba della Rabia  wants her brother Orso  to avenge the murder of their father by the powerful Barracini family. Despite being a lieutenant, Orso is a man of peace and reason who opposes the Corsican practice of vendetta and revenge; he is more interested in courting the beautiful English aristocrat, Lydia Nevil , who is vacationing on the island with her father, Col. Sir Thomas Nevil . To persuade Orso to do his family duty, Colomba must have the help of a family friend, the "bandit" Padrino , and his servant Brando . When Orso is finally convinced that the Barracinis are guilty, and were acquitted at trial due to perjured testimony, he challenges Vincente Barracini to a duel, which pleases Colomba but horrifies Lydia. She is now bethrothed to Orso, but threatens to leave him if he goes through with the duel. When Orso heads to the appointed place, Colomba finds out that the Barracini brothers are going to ambush him, and rides out to give him warning. In the confrontation that comes, Colomba is shot and dies in Orso's arms, the Barracinis are killed, and Orso is wounded, but not seriously. Padrino tells the grief-striken Orso that he must use his experience to guide the people to a better way of living, breaking the cycle of vendetta and death.TCM Full synopsis<ref nameavg&sql=1:115468 Plot synopsis ]
