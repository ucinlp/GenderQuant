Detective Joe Leland is called to the home of a murder victim who has been beaten to death and has had his genitals removed. Puzzled and disgusted, the police on call are left bemused, Leland holding things together with his direct, no-nonsense approach. Few leads are found, other than the fact that a house-mate of the victim remains conspicuous by his absence. All the while notions about the victim's sexuality and personal interests warp the ideals of the officers assigned to the task. Leland tries to remain focused on the case while, at the same time, dealing with the breakdown of his marriage to wife Karen. Eventually, the victim's housemate is identified as one Felix Tesla, and he is soon tracked down by Leland and another detective. A psychologically disturbed Tesla cracks until eventually Leland coaxes a confession out of him. This results in extensive publicity, a promotion for Leland and the electric chair for Tesla, which distresses Leland because it is clear to him that Tesla is insane. Later, across town, a man kills himself by jumping from the rooftop of a racetrack. The case goes all but unnoticed until the wife of the dead man, Norma McIver, comes to Leland's office and asks him to look into it, believing something far more complex is involved. Leland soon learns that certain powerful interests in the city do not want him asking questions. The incorruptible detective presses on, at risk to his career and life, as he discovers a lurid relationship between the man's suicide and the previous murder.
