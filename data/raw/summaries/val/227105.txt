Filmed among the ruins of the Crystal Palace Terraces, The Pleasure Garden is a poetic ode to desire, and winner of the Prix de Fantasie Poetique at Cannes in 1954. Made by the American poet James Broughton, the film features Hattie Jacques and Lindsay Anderson, with John le Mesurier as the bureaucrat determined to stamp out any form of free expression. The history of the Crystal Palace also comes alive in The Phoenix Tower, presented as an extra on the BFI DVD release.
