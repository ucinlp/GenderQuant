Forestry graduate Jim Thornton saves a young woman, Joan Burbridge, from drowning at Palm Beach. He later turns up to work at her adopted father Stephen's timber company. Burbridge is secretly being undermined by his treacherous foreman Darley and competitor Charles Blake. Blake is also engaged to Joan despite sleeping with Darleyâ€™s sister Claire. Thornton eventually exposes Darley and takes his job, and organises a timber drive. The drive involves dynamiting trees at the top of a ridge, causing trees along the whole hillside to collapse in a chain reaction. When Darley finds out Blake has been sleeping with Joan he shoots him dead, and Joan and Thornton are almost trapped amongst the falling timber trees. The trees kill Darley, but Joan and Thornton manage to survive. Thorton reveals himself to be Stephen Burbridge's long-lost son, and he and Joan are married.
