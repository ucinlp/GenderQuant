Donald is taking a tour of the Grand Canyon. Although he just wants to enjoy the whole exhibition, this is made all but impossible by constant admonishment from the rulebook-wielding tour guide: none other than Ranger J. Audubon Woodlore. Donald and Woodlore continue to irritate each other - Donald by innocently tripping over various regulations , and Woodlore by chastising him for it - until Woodlore himself disturbs a mountain lion...the last one seen in these parts since the Civil War; it is, in fact, the same lion! Woodlore is caught in the middle as said cougar chases Donald through the Canyon, which results in most of it being destroyed . With all the other tourists having fled, Woodlore sternly - and rather insultingly - demands that both Donald and the lion dig another Grand Canyon to restore what they ruined; accordingly, he passes them a couple of shovels and yells out "So START DIGGING!!". Feeling extremely remorseful, Donald and the lion agree to do so and they start digging to restore the Grand Canyon back to its former glory while having moping faces.
