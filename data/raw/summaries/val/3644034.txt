In the first years of the 1920s, a sickly and dying Count Dracula , who as a vampire must drink virgin blood to survive, travels from Transylvania to Italy, following his servant Anton's  plan and thinking he will be more likely to find a virgin in a Catholic country. At the same time, all of Dracula's family has vanished because of two reasons, the lack of virgins in their hometown and how the family's reputation prevents any common family from choosing to bring women to the renowned castle. Shortly after arriving to Italy, Dracula befriends Marchese di Fiore , an impecunious Italian landowner who, with a lavish estate falling into decline, is willing to marry off one of his four daughters to the wealthy aristocrat. Of di Fiore's four daughters, two regularly enjoy the sexual services of Mario, the estate handyman , a proud peasant and staunch Marxist who believes that the socialist revolution will happen soon in his country. The youngest and eldest daughters are virgins, but the latter is thought too plain to be offered for marriage, and is past her prime, and the youngest is only 14 years old . Dracula obtains assurances that all the daughters are virgins and drinks the blood of the two who are considered marriageable. However, their tainted blood reveals him the truth and makes him even more weaker. Nevertheless, he is able to turn the two girls into his mental slaves. Soon after the Marchese Di Fiore travels out of Italy to pay his great debts, Mario discovers that Dracula is a vampire and what he has done to the Di Fiore sisters. When he realizes the danger Dracula poses to the youngest daughter, he rapes her to achieve her protection. Mario warns Di Fiore's wife, La Marchesa Di Fiore , about Dracula's plan. Meanwhile Dracula has drunk the blood of the eldest daughter, turning her into a vampire and regaining strength. La Marchesa confronts and is stabbed by Anton, whom she shoots and kills before dying. Mario dismembers Dracula with an axe and kills him and the eldest of the Di Fiore's with a stake, becoming the De facto master and manager of the estate.
