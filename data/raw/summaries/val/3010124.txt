A newspaper reporter returns from the war to New York City. After reporting to his job at his old newspaper, he finds that his old editor doesn't like his new ideas. Corey, with his reporter friends from the war, go off to start his own smaller tabloid style newspaper which will feature "the news before it happens." Corey gambles with a mob boss and wins the money to start up his paper, the New York Mercury, and the paper is an instant success. However, because of a number of stories that may implicate the newspaper's silent partner in a number of crimes, Corey finds himself and his staff threatened and even shot at. Corey finally kills the mob boss and flees the country on a plane that is attempting a trans-Atlantic flight. The plane crashes and the newspaper editor is killed.
