{{Plot}} Max Grabelski ([[Daniel Stern  is involved with delivering packages to a millionaire named Reinhart Bragden  for a $50 tip for each one. He shows up one night, delivering one at 10 PM instead of 10 AM. Inside he finds a fire and Agent Palmer  tries to arrest him for starting it and killing Bragden, but he grabs a gun and escapes. On the news, Palmer falsely names Grabelski as the suspect in Bragden's murder. He also claims that he was trying to take money that was scheduled to be taken out of circulation. Grabelski then finds out from his boss that another package for Bragden is to be delivered to a place called Devil's Peak. He drives up there while, at the same time, Ranger Scout Troop 12 Scouts Gordy Patterson, Ralph, Dana Jareki, Barnhill, Milton Fishman, and Kelsey Jordan are planning an overnighter near there. He steals a car, drives to a gas station, and meets Scout Leader Jack Erickson , who was going to meet them there and whose Hummer he then steals at gunpoint when the gas station attendant figures out he is the wanted man. He switches places with Erickson, , gluing his hands and chin to the steering wheel, and takes his stolen station wagon. Grabelski heads to Devil's Peak but an officer informs him he is "late" for the troop. He is mistaken for the Scout Leader and finds himself in the midst of an overnighter. Police pull over the station wagon Erickson had taken and the police do not know he is the wrong person until they pull his glued hands, and chin from the steering wheel by force since he could not come out. FBI agents then swarm the base of Devil's Peak, as well as the scouts other terrified parents,  and Palmer and Erickson go after him and the troop . He begins acting weird around them, who see it as brilliance rather than crazy and they decide to scale the mountain rather than just have an overnighter. The troop then nickname him "Spider". He and the troop escape from Palmer and Erickson after the troop  accidentally urinate on them. They encounter a wooden bridge that is fragile in between two cliffs. Everyone manages to make it through the bridge, except Milton, who is afraid to go along and is stuck. Grabelski then cuts the bridge using an axe so that Palmer and Erickson can't go across. Palmer tries to shoot Grabelski down with a sniper rifle, but Erickson, who fears that Milton will fall off the bridge, stops him from shooting Grabelski. Grabelski threatens to cut the bridge down anyway with Milton still on it, and just before he can cut the other side of the bridge, Milton runs and makes it to the other side of the cliff, while Grabelski fully cuts the wooden bridge down. When night falls, they stop and rest and make a campfire using pinecones, in which Grabelski accidentally takes a beehive and mistakes it as a pinecone and is stung a number of times. Later that night, Dana secretly shows a Playboy magazine for Ralph and Barnhill to see, but Grabelski catches them looking at the explicit pictures, and takes it away from them and looks at the magazine himself. When Dana persuades Grabelski to talk about sexual intercourse, he, at first, declines this, but Milton falsely claims that the manual says that the Scout Leader can talk about these things, and he agrees to talk about it. Using Kelsey's Barbie doll's, Grabelski re-enacts how it is done , but at the end, the whole troop is in shocked to realize what sex really is in real life. The following morning, Gordy is on the radio and hears their troop number and that they are "being held hostage by a psychotic murderer" and they realize "Spider" is "Mad Max" Grabelski rather than the Scout Leader originally sent to help them. The troop investigate the tent Grabelski is sleeping in. Grabelski, in a near-sleepwalk experience, accidentally pulls his pistol out  in front of the troop and points it at Grody's face, scaring the entire troop. They send out smoke signals for help, which Palmer and Erickson see, but it accidentally spells "BELP", rather than "HELP". The troop then drug a canteen, using sleeping pills, cough syrup, and allergy medicine so that when Grabelski drinks the canteen, he will fall asleep. The plan works, but not before Milton calls Grabelski's last name by mistake. Palmer, however, shows up alone and "arrests" Grabelski, and Gordy senses that something is wrong. At first the troop believe to the fact that he is a murderer, but when a helicopter is heard in the trees, the troop, except Gordy, think they are safe until the chopper flies past them. They then realize Grabelski is innocent when Bragden arrives alive and explains the situation to him. Bragden and Palmer are in on the scheme and try to frame him because "no one gives a damn about him". They will then get away with the money once and for all. It is then revealed Palmer tied Erickson to a tree nearby. Not only Bragden and Palmer want to kill Grabelski, but they also want to kill the troop as well. Before Palmer can shoot Grabelski with his revolver, the troop launch rocks at the them via Kelsey's bra. They manage to hit Palmer with one of the rocks, but when they try to hit Bragden next, he ducks and the rock accidentally hits Grabelski in the face and falls in the river. Bragden and Palmer then chase after the troop, determined to kill them all. Dana is separated in the chase, and runs downriver to avoid capture. The remaining troop are trapped in a cliff and with Bragden and Palmer approaching them, they have no choice but to jump in the water. Milton jumps last, just when Bragden and Palmer try to capture him, but when Palmer tries to grab him, he only grabs his scout hat, as Milton jumps in the water. They chase them using the helicopter so that Palmer will try to shoot and kill Grabelski and the troop with his sniper rifle again, but fail and Grabelski and the troop end up getting away after surviving a near-death experience on a waterfall, with the help of Dana pulling them inland. Hearing the helicopter approaching them, they throw their bags in the river to make them think they are dead. As the helicopter approaches, they hide in the bushes to avoid being spotted. The bags fall down the waterfall and they believe it and leave. They then resume their journey to Devils Peak. At night, it starts to down pour and thunder, but they manage to find a cave. In the cave, they discuss what they should do to Bragden and Palmer when they get to the top of the mountain and their cabin, but Grabelski declines the act of violence against them, and to only foil the scheme. The next morning, after sleeping in the cave, the gang heads towards Devil's Peak while the Troop Leader, Gordy's mother, Aggie Patterson , discovers a note left by Grabelski that has an address written on it  and she drives up there only to be tied up in a chair by Bragden. The troop makes it to the top, and the truck arrives with the last $10 million. Hearing the kids arguring that they want to go with them to resuce Gordy's mom and foil the scheme, Palmer catches them and tries to kill all of them, starting with Grabelski first, but Erickson arrives just in time before he can shoot them and the kids glue him to a tree. Grabelski tries to untie Mrs. Patterson, and when he tries to take the tape out of her mouth, she angrily accuses him for taking the kids on the dangerous camping trip and for not being a real Scout Leader, which causes him to put the tape back in her mouth to avoid being heard. As he tries to untie her, they are caught by Bragden. Bragden forces Grabelski and Patterson at gunpoint to the porch and tries to shoot them dead. Before he can kill them, Gordy charges at Bragden. He almost shoots Gordy when he swings the pistol at him. Gordy accidentally trips on a piece of wood and falls off the cliff as Bragden moves out of the way, but not before Gordy manages to knock the pistol off his hand. Bragden tries to run away, but Grabelski subdues him by punching him in the face, knocking his teeth out and knocking him unconscious. Grabelski has already foiled Bragden's scheme, but now has to save Gordy, who is holding on a branch on the side of the cliff that is already cracking. Grabelski is able to rescue him, just as the branch gives way, and the troop receives Eagle Scout honors. He is proven innocent and receives Scout Leader honors. The movie ends with Grabelski and the troop being swarmed by a giant group of kids that are heading to Yosemite with him.
