Martin Delambre  is driving to Montreal one night when he sees a running young girl in her underwear by the name of Patricia Stanley . They fall in love and are soon married. However, they both hold secrets: she has recently escaped from a mental asylum; he and his father Henri  are engaged in radical experiments in teleportation, and they have already had horrific consequences. Martin also suffers recessive fly genes which cause him to age rapidly and he needs a serum to keep him young. In a rambling mansion in rural Quebec, they have successfully teleported people between there and London. However there had been many failures producing horribly disfigured and mad people who are locked up in the stables. Martin's first wife is one of them. The police and keeper of the asylum trace Stanley to the Delambre place where they find out she has married Martin but it comes out that he had a previous wife whom he did not divorce. Inspector Charas, who had investigated Andre Delambre and is now an old man in the hospital, tells the policeman about the Delambre family and their experiments. As the police begin to close in, a mixture of callousness and madness afflicts the Delambres and people are killed and more monstrosities are produced. The Asian couple  who were helping them have had enough and leave. Martin sends Henri to London not knowing the reintegrater has been destroyed and Stanley has had enough and she tries to escape. Martin tries to stop her but starts aging again and he is without his serum so he dies. The police arrive. The film ends with the words: "Is this the end?"
