During the Civil War, Thad Goodwin  of Elmtree Farm, a local horse breeder resists Capt. John Dillon  and a company of Union soldiers confiscating his prize horses. He is killed by Dillon and his youngest son Peter  cries at the soldiers riding away with the horses. 75 years later, in 1938, Peter  now a crotchety old man, still resides on Elmtree Farm and raises horses with his niece Sally . Dillon's grandson Jack  and Sally meet, her not knowing that he was a Dillon. Peter Goodwin dies when his speculation on cotton drops. The Goodwins are forced to auction off nearly all their horses and Jack offers his services to Sally, as a trainer of their last prize horse, "Bessie's Boy", who falls ill. Sally eventually loses the farm, and Mr. Dillon makes good on his original bet with Thad and offers her any two year old on his farm. She picks "Blue Grass" instead of the favorite, "Postman", and Peter trains him for the Derby. She eventually learns of Jack's real identity. During the race, Blue Grass runs neck and neck with the Goodwin's horse Postman, but Blue Grass wins. Sally embraces Jack, but Peter collapses before the decoration ceremony and dies. At his funeral, Dillon eulogizes him and of the American life of the past, as "The Grand Old Man of the American Turf".
