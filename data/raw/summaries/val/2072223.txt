CharactersPossible interpretations Open Your Mind starts as a kind of space journey and exploration of a foreign planet by an advanced civilization. The time is unexplained: it could be an offworld intelligence form visiting our planet, or it could be future human travellers visiting a remote galaxy.  Also it could be a fabricated dream, à la Soylent Green, experienced by one of our descendants willing to learn how precious and beautiful the Earth was in its prime and experienced through a chronological and geographical exploration of the planet. Dreams are a classic theme in Oshii's production including Urusei Yatsura: Beautiful Dreamer and The Red Spectacles. The pavilion concept's name "Mountain of Dreams" is probably not a coincidence. According to the theory, agreed by Oshii , that the futuristic projection of Science Fiction is nothing more than a metaphorous description of the present and current society, just like Montesquieu  and Voltaire  implicitly describing -criticizing- their own country through the eyes of a foreign character or civilization, this work could be viewed as a warning  to preserve our, current, highly menaced, biosphere and ecosystem before it is too late. This film was presented at the World Exposition hence its universal message and collective matter. The original title "Ark of Awakening" , is a double reference to the Bible's "Noah's Ark" and to Buddha, which means "awakened". In this perspective the movie can be interpreted as a futuristic, post-flood, returning trip to Earth on board an ark ship with the featured creatures being part of the breeding stock of saved animals. Vis-à-vis the amount of religious references being Shinto , Buddhism , the Bible (Noah's Ark, [[Flood  or the Greek mythology (Centaur, [[Chimera , and connecting them with the depiction of fantasy ancient or future- races that are the mysterious creatures, this work could also be regarded as a mythological tale of Creation , in the likes of Stanley Kubrick's Space Odyssey.
