Near the completion of his sentence in Sing Sing prison, Paul Vitti's life is threatened by assassins and corrupt guards while incarcerated. He fakes insanity and starts singing showtunes from West Side Story to get the attention of Ben Sobel, who previously hung up on him while attending his father's funeral. The FBI calls in Ben to see if Vitti is really insane. This appears to be the case, and Ben gets permission to take Vitti out of prison, into his own custody, for more therapy. On their way out in Sobel's car, Vitti reveals that he faked it. Needing some therapy himself after his father's death, a grieving Sobel talks Vitti into finding a regular job . Vitti attempts to find a legitimate job , but his rude manners and paranoia mess things up. At the same time, he also discovers that the Rigazzi family is who wants him dead. He reacts to this by telling the Rigazzis that he is 'out' and seeking a new line of work. He finds employment working as a technical advisor on the set of a Sopranos-like mafia TV series. Meanwhile, FBI agents inform Sobel that Vitti has his old crew back together, and may be planning something big. This rouses Sobel's suspicion, and he visits Vitti, getting caught up with him in a car chase, which ends up with Vitti escaping. The FBI blames Sobel, and gives him 24 hours to track down Vitti. After locating Vitti , Sobel discovers Vitti is planning a big armored car heist. He tries to talk Vitti out of it, but Vitti goes ahead and Sobel is forced to go along. The crew ambush the armored car with smoke grenades, and lift it over a fence in the midst of the confusion. They extract $20M worth of gold bullion, but some of Rigazzi's thugs take over. Sobel in a fit of anger defeats one of them and Vitti's men take care of the rest. They use the $20 million in gold bullion to frame the Rigazzi family, leaving three Rigazzi goons locked in the armored truck suspended from the crane. This leads to the arrest of the entire Rigazzi family, and in turn, prevents a mob war. Sobel meets with Vitti and Jelly near bridges on the New York waterfront, and they part ways again as friends, singing another West Side Story showtune together.
