In Hollywood, the young teacher Nell  and her husband Steven  move to an old building called Lusman Arms. Some sixty years ago, the place was glamorous, but presently is completely dilapidated, and many of its residents have disappeared while living there. While her husband is working in the hospital, the lonely Nell hears weird noises and becomes afraid of their home. While jogging, she is introduced and becomes close to her neighbor Julia Cunningham  and they schedule a hike together on the next day. Julia never shows up, and Nell looks for her in the building. She finds that there is an evil being living hidden behind a wall with many corpses.
