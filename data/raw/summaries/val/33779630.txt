The story goes that the Pink Panther attempts to mow his lawn, but learns that his lawnmower is in need of a new spark plug. While installing the new spark plug, it falls from his hands, and is found by a vicious watchdog who thinks it is a bone. The panther tries to get the plug back first by trying stilt walking, a balloon kit and a rope to walk on, then by digging himself under the garden and finally posing as a bone inspector. When the panther finally installed his new spark plug, it begins to snow like it's Christmas.
