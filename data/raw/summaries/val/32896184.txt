Bill Lawson , a wharf labourer, loses his job and decides to go out bush to find work to support his wife Elsa  and daughter Betty. He befriends a well-born Englishman, Kenneth Hillyard  after rescuing him from two thugs and the two decide to go prospecting together. They have a variety of adventures before stumbling upon a gold deposit. Then while walking along the cliffs one day Bill slips and falls into the river below. Kenneth looks for him but can't find the body and Bill is believed to be dead. Kenneth returns to the city to share the gold with Elsa and Betty. When Kenneth inherits money from an English relative, he proposes to Elsa. Years later a bush character appears, 'Mad Joe', who is Bill - it turns out Bill survived the fall but lost his memory. He later regains his memory after a hospital operation and tracks down his wife. But once he sees how happy she is with Elsa, he returns to the bush.{{cite news}}
