The story begins with Bugs reading the classic fairy tale Hansel and Gretel. Witch Hazel plays the witch who tries to cook and eat the children.  Bugs witnesses Witch Hazel coaxing the children inside and goes in her house, disguised as a truant officer, and saves the youths from her clutches. The children both turn to Hazel as they leave and say in a thick German accent: "Ach - your mother rides a vacuum cleaner!" However, once Hazel realizes that Bugs is a rabbit, she tries to cook him instead, using a carrot  as a lure. Bugs eats the carrot and falls asleep and Witch Hazel puts him into a pot to make rabbit stew. While the witch is occupied, a character resembling Prince Charming enters the house and kisses Bugs' hand. Bugs wakes up and says: "You're looking for Snow White, this is the story of HAHHN-sel and Gretel", and the Prince leaves, confused about how Hansel is pronounced. Bugs then tries to escape down a corridor but is trapped by Hazel. As she approaches, Bugs finds her magic power and uses it to transform her into a gorgeous lady bunny who has a feminine voice but still has Hazel's laugh. As he gets ready to leave with the bunny beauty, Bugs looks at the audience, breaking the fourth wall, and comments: "Ah sure, I know. But aren't they all witches inside?".
