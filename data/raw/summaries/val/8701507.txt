Assistant district attorney Dana Greenway conspires with police lieutenant Maria Johnson to go after a serial sexual predator who identifies himself to his victims as "David Hanover," a distinguished photographer. Greenway goes undercover, changing her appearance and passing herself off as a repressed schoolteacher. She eventually encounters Hanover, who seduces her, photographs her nude and causes Lt. Johnson to believe that Greenway might actually have fallen under his spell. Flashbacks to her troubled childhood, including abuse from a father who locked her in a closet, haunt Greenway as she attempts to come to her senses and get the better of Hanover, who clearly intends to humiliate and then kill her.
