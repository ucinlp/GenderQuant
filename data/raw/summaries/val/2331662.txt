College students Paxton and Josh, along with their friend Óli, are backpacking across Europe. After a night of partying, they meet a Dutch man named Alexei who informs them about an undocumented hostel near Bratislava filled with beautiful women. The three subsequently board a train on which they meet a strange Dutch businessman, whose bizarre behavior puzzles them until he places his hand on Josh's knee, causing him to react badly. The three leave the train at a small Slovak village, check into the local hostel and find themselves sharing a room with two beautiful single women, Natalya and Svetlana. At a disco, Josh is saved from a gang of impoverished children looking for money and bubblegum by the strange businessman. The next day, a young Japanese backpacker, Kana, approaches Paxton and Josh who are searching for Óli, informing them that her friend Yuki is strangely missing as well. A MMS photo sent from Yuki's phone shows Yuki and Óli with the word "Sayonara" beneath it and later, they spot a man wearing Óli's jacket. Not long after, Paxton and Josh receive a second MMS photo message from Óli's phone, in which their friend appears in a closeup face shot saying "I go home". The scene shifts to the source of the photo, revealing Óli's severed head sitting on a table. Paxton and Josh decide to leave Bratislava with Kana the following day and Paxton later notices that the photo of Oli and Yuki are fake. Although Josh is anxious to leave immediately, Paxton talks him into staying just one more night so they can have sex with Natalya and Svetlana again. Josh agrees and later that night while partying with Natalya and Svetlana, Paxton and Josh are slipped tranquilizers. Josh stumbles back to the hostel while Paxton passes out in the disco's storage room. Josh wakes up handcuffed to a chair in a dungeon-like room. The businessman comes in and starts torturing him, telling him about his failed dream of being a surgeon. After slicing Josh's achilles tendons and seemingly allowing him to leave, the now unable to walk Josh is killed by the businessman. Paxton returns to his room where two women, eerily similar to Natalya and Svetlana, invite him to a spa. When the local police chief proves unhelpful, Paxton locates Natalya and Svetlana and interrogates them on the whereabouts of Josh, successfully getting them to show him. Once Paxton enters a factory, he shockingly witnesses the businessman cutting open Josh's corpse. He is then ambushed by thugs and taken to a cell and learns that he was sold. He is restrained in a chair and joined minutes later by a German client, Johann. After trying to reason with him, Johann calls one of the thugs to silence him with a ball gag. He prepares to kill Paxton, however Paxton begins to vomit, where Johann takes the gag off and torments him. Accidentally cutting off two of Paxton's fingers, he unknowingly severs Paxton's restraints. Johann slips and cuts his own leg off with his chainsaw and Paxton gets out of the chair and shoots Johann. Paxton shoots the guard that comes in, escapes the cell and hides in the bottom of a cart piled with corpses. The man with the cart goes to the bottom floor of the building and Paxton kills him. He goes up and makes it to a dressing room and meets an American who has also come here to join an organization called the Elite Hunting Club. He asks Paxton questions on the experience believing that Paxton also paid. Paxton discovers Kana being tortured by the American and frees her, killing the man. The two flee in a car and accidentally meet Natalya, Svetlana and Alexei on a street, running them over and killing them. With the help of the child gang, Paxton and Kana elude the guards and head to the train station. When Kana sees a reflection of her disfigured face, she jumps in front of an oncoming train, while Paxton gets on another one. Aboard the train, Paxton hears the voice of the businessman, follows him to a public restroom and brutally murders him. Paxton then boards a train leaving the area.  The alternate ending involved Paxton kidnapping the doctor's daughter while he goes to the bathroom and she goes in the women's room. As the doctor frantically looks for her, Paxton is shown covering the girls mouth and the train leaves. In Eli Roth's original Hostel script, the alternate ending was his ending but when Tarantino and Roth came up with the other ending, they decided to shoot both and the new ending came out better. They didn't want to end the film with Paxton being a stone cold killer/kidnapper. They wanted a revenge style ending but with sympathy for Paxton, not the doctor.
