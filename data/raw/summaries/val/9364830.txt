The film continues the story of Sara (now being played by Izabella Miko. Sara Johnson, originally played by Julia Stiles and now portrayed by Izabella Miko, breaks the forth wall and speaks directly to the audience. She recalls how she was born to be a dancer. Her mother would often comment that she knew how to pirouette before she could properly walk. From her earliest memories Sara always wanted to be a ballerina, a graceful dancer who could glide across the stage. It seemed that there was something that caused conflict in Sara’s ambition. She also loved the urban dance form of hip-hop. While ballet was highly structured, full of rules and standards, hip-hop afford Sara a chance to just let go and follow the beat. Sara wants the best of both worlds but the conflict between structure and independence affected her performance in both formats. This sequel basically starts off soon after the original left off. Sara has made the first part of her dream come through. Her audition with the world famous Julliard School of Dance worked out well and she was accepted resulting in her moving from Chicago to New York City. Sara would soon find out that as rough as it was to get there staying would require raising the bar to almost painful heights. Her main dance teacher, Monique Delacroix  is old school when it comes to demanding each student master the traditional and arduous curriculum. She has little to no use for the influence of any other form of dance on ballet so the concept of hip-hop is not only foreign to the staid teacher it is repugnant. During orientation on her first day at Julliard Sara meets Miles Sultana , who takes her for a trombone player. When she tells him she is there for ballet he questions whether she is a ballerina. Sara boldly states that she is already a ballerina; she is there to become a prima ballerina. This set up a playful antagonism that we all know will end up in a romantic relationship. Sara also has to deal with the students at her new school. In a high pressure school like Julliard the more favor you gather with the teachers the more jealousy you encounter from the students. It is a cut throat environment with an extremely high failure rate. Among her new classmates is Marcus  who infuriates Ms Delacroix the first day for wearing pants that ‘swish’. Then there is Katrina  destined to be the main rival for our girl Sara. It also turns out that Miles is actually her professor for ‘Introduction to Hip-Hop Theory’. I suppose this is a pre-requirement for Gangsta Rap 201. {{Expand section}}
