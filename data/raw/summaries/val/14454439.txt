The Stooges are inept, but honest, street cleaners. When they come across an envelope filled with oil bonds in the trash, they return them to their owner, B.O. Davis ([[John Tyrrell . The grateful Davis offers them a 5,000-dollar reward if they can find an honest man with executive abilities. An honest dog ultimately leads them to a weeping girl  who explains that her sweetheart has been unfairly jailed. The best way to talk to him, the Stooges figure, is to get arrested themselves. They land in the clink and track down their man, Percy Pomeroy . With some black paint, they make their prison outfits look like guard uniforms and make their escape. Just as they are leaving, Davis is coming in â€” handcuffed to a detective and revealed as "Lone Wolf Louie, the biggest bond swindler in America." The Stooges wind up back in jail, breaking rocks over Curly's head.
