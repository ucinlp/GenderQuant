The criminal international organization THRUSH steals the bomb H975 and demands $300,000,000, to be delivered within 72 hours by their former antagonist, Napoleon Solo. This forces U.N.C.L.E., the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement, has to reactivate the two top agents of its Section II, Solo and Illya Kuryakin, both of whom had left its ranks 15 years before and are now pursuing other lines of civilian workâ€”Kuryakin as a fashion designer whose resignation was acrimonious and precipitated by a professional disaster, Solo as a marketer of computers and independent businessman. Equipped in their original fashion, Solo and Kuryakin search for the bomb and attempt to close down, permanently. what proves to be a splinter THRUSH group; the original organization had fragmented in 1968 after its failure in the "Seven Intellectual Wonders of the World" affair and has yet to regain the power to threaten worldwide law and order that it had possessed up to that time.
