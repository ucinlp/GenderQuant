This dark comedy from the UK, is a tale of two likeable but wayward young Russian backpackers who come to London in an attempt to amass an easy fortune. But it’s not too long before Spiker and Cobakka realize that legally, they aren’t going to get very far. So, aided by the dodgy Artash they learn to shoplift from supermarkets, rip off banks, joyride on the London Underground and turn mobile phones into crack cocaine.
