Noah  is a college student who has been suspended and now lives with his mom. After having a disagreement with his mother, he is lured into taking a babysitting job caring for the unruly kids of Mrs. Pedulla: her neurotic son Slater , party-loving wild child Blithe  and the pyromaniac adopted son Rodrigo . Soon Noah is invited to a party to have sexual intercourse with his supposed girlfriend Marisa , who up to that point had used him only for oral sex. She agrees to have sex with him only if he brings her drugs to the party. Noah, tempted by the offer, steals Mrs. Pedulla's car and takes the kids to the city, where he meets drug-dealing Karl  in his bodybuilding shop. Karl likes to hide his cocaine in expensive baby dinosaur eggs and loves to make new friends. After purchasing the drugs, Noah drives off, soon realizing Rodrigo has stolen an egg from Karl. After a struggle the egg bursts open, wasting all the cocaine inside. Karl finds out the drugs are missing and calls Noah, after finding his number on Facebook, he tells Noah that he has to come up with $10,000 or he will kill him. Noah, in a panic, decides to take the kids back to their parents but thinks against it feeling he has to fix his own problems. He then takes the kids to a bat mitzvah  for a bratty popular girl who goes to school with Slater. Noah runs into Roxanne  a girl he knew before he dropped out of college and realizes she likes him. There Slater sees his friend, Clayton , who lied to him earlier saying that he could not hang out with him because his spider died. Clayton admits he lied because he was sick of hanging out with him at his house, just watching tennis and not going anywhere. He was also upset about Slater texting him too much and acting jealous about Clayton's other relationships. Noah finds out the valet service has lost his van, which was actually stolen. Noah heads to his estranged father's house to ask his father for the money. After his father berates him and refuses to give him money, Noah steals his father's car and breaks into his father's jewelry store, where his father changed the security codes from Noah's birthday to his current child further showing his father's distaste for Noah. He then takes his father's most valuable diamonds. Rodrigo, fascinated with bombs, puts a cherry bomb in the bathroom blowing up the store. Noah, frustrated with Rodrigo's antics, yells at him. Believing that no one in the family likes him, a frustrated Rodrigo throws Slater's medicine out the window. Slater has a panic attack over the missing medicine, during which Noah tells him that he, Slater, is a closeted homosexual. At first angry, Slater comes to accept this and calms down. Noah sees his stolen van and follows the thieves to a club where he runs across a girl he went to high school with, in whose urn he accidentally vomited, and the same girl from back in college. Noah trying to appeal to thug/gangster nature allows her to hit him as an apology, which she does, then makes amends, because, "he ain't the pussy he once was". He gets pulled over because he accidentally ran a red light while talking to his girlfriend on the cell phone. Two corrupt cops search the vehicle, where they find the diamonds and cocaine, then speed off stealing both. After Rodrigo provokes Slater, Slater asks why he is so rude. Rodrigo replies, it is because he will just get readopted after a couple of years, like every other time. When Karl shows up, Noah, Marisa and the kids run from him. During the car chase Noah talks to Karl, saying he wants to be his friend, and makes Karl roll down his window. Rodrigo throws a fire cracker in Karl's van. While Noah is celebrating he crashes into a park sign. When Noah runs into a dead end running away from Karl, the girl he knew back in high school and her "crew" suddenly come after Blithe calls them, beating Karl up, and Noah takes the kids back home. Marisa realizes she was a terrible girlfriend and that she got Noah into the night's mess. Noah agrees, letting her know that he is done with her, with no hard feelings. Finally Noah gets the kids home before their parents come back, cleaning up their mess. The kids all get extremely close to Noah and start listening to him. Mr. Pedulla while paying Noah for babysitting, tells him he should "get his shit together". Noah acknowledges that he may need some work, but the last person he will take advice from is him, since he is cheating on his wife with his assistant Debra, then tells him his wife is "smoking hot" and should ditch Debra and focus on "tapping that ass". Roxanne meets him at the house, and they leave together walking home hand-in-hand. During the credits, there are wanted posters with Noah and the kids, telling what happened to them.
