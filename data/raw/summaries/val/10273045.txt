 The film starts as Takuma Tsurugi retrieves Go Owada during a riot. After Tsurugi receives what is believed to be payment for bringing Go to them, he discovers that he had been paid in newspapers. Outraged, Tsurugi lashes out at the mobsters present and clashes with a young woman from Taiwan named Huo Feng. The Owada family is enraged that Tsurugi turned on them and decides to crush him. Upon returning from a shareholders' meeting at Tokyo Chemical, Seigan blackmails a politician, Mr. Iizuka, with a tape recording of a recent conversation just as Tsurugi ambushes them and steals the tape. Aya is inspired to hire a former Mafioso from Chicago, Frankie Black, after watching him tear apart a strong chain on live television. Upon hearing who her new partner is, Huo Feng turns on the Owada family and decides to align herself with Tsurugi. Meanwhile, Kunigami confronts Tsurugi after Aya outwits him following a dance at the local club, and he nabs the missing tape after defeating him at the local fairgrounds. Afterwards, Tsurugi turns to Master Masaoka to learn some Okinawa styles of martial arts. Tsurugi later encounters Huo Feng after she intercepts him in a tunnel. Unknown to them, Frankie Black and his gang had shown up to ambush them, and Black kills Huo Feng before retrieving the money Tsurugi had been paid for the blackmail tape. Kunigami then allies himself with Seigan to crush Tsurugi, who chases after some of the Owada family's goons, disguised as a motorcycle cop, and fights them at a car crushing plant. Seigan sends Aya after the money, which Tsurugi had hidden at Aoidani Funeral Home. She brings Black along to help with the retrieval. Tsurugi intercepts them, having cleverly hidden himself inside one of the twin retorts behind a conveniently-placed casket, and burns Black to death in the ensuing struggle. Aya then proceeds to seduce him. Some time later, Go ambushes Tsurugi, and the two fight, giving Aya enough time to escape with the suitcases.

Unknown to the survivors, Tsurugi then puts a deadly surprise in the Owada family car.
