Molly Slade  wakes up feeling extremely depressed. She has run out of tea and goes to the local shop to buy some, but finds the shop still closed. Pushed over the edge by this seemingly trivial inconvenience, she ends up attempting suicide by jumping from a bridge into the river but is saved in time. Husband Arthur  comes home from work to find that Molly has been committed to a psychiatric hospital. Molly's treatment involves medication and electroconvulsive therapy. While in hospital she befriends fellow patient Betty  and together they are seen in exercise classes, playing table tennis and receiving occupational therapy. Molly leaves the hospital one night and goes home, but Arthur returns her to the hospital until she has completed her treatment and been officially released. Finally, with her treatment concluded and her mind back on an even keel, Molly is able to return to her family.
