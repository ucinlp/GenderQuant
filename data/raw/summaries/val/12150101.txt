Alex McNetti has a rare disease which gives him very brittle bones. His friend Thomas Granger believes that he has found the cure by feeding his friend dead flesh to counteract the terrible disease. However the process does have its side effects including making Alex cough up and vomit worms, and also turning him into a zombie. The dead start to rise from their graves and butcher every living human they see to pieces, including a heavily armed SWAT team. The zombies later invade a vastly populated city, killing every living person in sight once again.
