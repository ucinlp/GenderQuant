In this scathing satirical drama that takes place in a village of West Africa, an untutored pig-keeper who has been thrown out of his home falls into a river and has a vision which sends him back to his people to save them for Jesus Christ, introducing himself as Magloire I, “the cousin of Christ.” A little crazy, a little robber, while some think he is a charlatan and others think he is a prodigy, he reigns as an absolute master and pushes his convictions to extremes, like being crucified. This movie recalls with humour the proliferation of sects and the outrageous acts they can convey in a continent like Africa, tossed about tradition, modernity and power.
