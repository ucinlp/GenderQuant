Despite only a few years having passed in the real world, many decades have passed in Tao, the parallel universe from the first movie. The roos have changed over the years, now appearing little different than normal humans, and a new villain, Dogon, seizes control of Tao from its young queen. Ryan Jeffers and his friend Chucky, now 16–year–old martial arts competitors in Beijing, find themselves unexpectedly transported to Tao where it is shown that they are to become Warriors of Virtue.
