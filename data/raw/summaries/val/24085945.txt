With a view to escaping his employers' daughter, who has amorous designs on him, Dr Simon Sparrow  signs on as medical officer on a cargo ship, "SS Lotus". The ship is commanded by hot-tempered and authoritarian Captain Wentworth Hogg. Sparrow overcomes initial seasickness and settles into life on board. After arriving in a South American port , Sparrow meets Hélène Colbert , a sexy young French nightclub singer. The misogynist Captain Hogg is forced to take on two female passengers, Muriel Mallet , the daughter of the chairman of the shipping company, and her friend, Hélène, for the return trip. Romance blossoms between Simon and Hélène, and when they reach home, Helene receives a telegram offering her a job in Rio de Janeiro. She and Sparrow return together. Throughout the trip, Hogg has been romanced by Muriel and eventually becomes engaged to her - with almost certain promotion to Commodore.
