Syracuse , called "Circus", is an Irish fisherman and former drunk, with a daughter named Annie, who is suffering kidney failure and uses a motorized wheelchair, and an ex-wife named Maura. One day, he finds a young woman  called Ondine in his net, whom he resuscitates. The woman is disoriented, but refuses hospitalization and doesn't want to be seen by people, so Syracuse takes her to his deceased motherâ€™s house. Later, at dialysis, he tells Annie a story about a fisherman who pulled in his nets and discovered a woman. Annie believes the woman in the net is a selkie. A man is seen lurking around the docks seemly looking for someone or something. It is later revealed that Ondine is actually a Romanian drug mule and the man lurking around the docks is the man Ondine works for . The man finds Ondine and wants the backpack  she lost at sea while trying to evade the Coast Guard  The backpack is in the ocean inside a lobster trap; as the Romanians are trying to get the trap, Ondine makes the Peste fall overboard by pulling on the rope he is standing on. Syracuse grabs the other one and dives into the water. The Peste drowns while trying to open the lobster trap, while the other one is brought back to the boat by Syracuse and is arrested on shore. In the end Syracuse marries Ondine so she can stay in Ireland, but mostly because he and Annie love her.
