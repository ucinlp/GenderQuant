At the Zevo Toys factory in a lovely field of green, owner Kenneth Zevo  is dying. He expresses to his assistant Owen Owens  that he wants control of the business to go to his brother, retired military man Lt. Gen. Leland Zevo . Leland Zevo himself is uncertain of his brother's wishes, instead pointing out that his nephew, Leslie Zevo , would be a worthy successor as he has apprenticed at Zevo Toys his entire life. Kenneth Zevo states that although Leslie loves his work, he is also too immature to be a good business owner and deal with the corporate world. After Kenneth dies, Leland takes over. At first he has no interest in anything at the factory until he hears of possible leaks and corporate espionage. Leland brings in his son Patrick , a soldier and expert in covert military operations, to oversee security. He soon decides to make a series of war toys. This dismays Leslie as Zevo Toys has never made war toys as Kenneth did not like them. After a confrontation with Leslie, Leland halts the development of the war toys. He asks Leslie for some space to work alone to develop some toys of his own and states he doesn't want Leslie to see them because they might not be good enough. Leland's continued demands for more space, rigid security and top-secret projects dismay the childlike Leslie, his innocent and childlike sister Alsatia , Owen, and a factory worker Leslie has developed a crush on named Gwen Tyler . Leslie becomes more suspicious when Owen shows him children arriving at the factory and ushered into the restricted area. He breaks into a research area and discovers kids playing realistic war video games. After setting off the alarm he runs through a door and falls into a well-like water tank where he sees and seems to be drowned by another toy of Leland's, the "Sea Swine" . Patrick decides to go against his father after he discovers that his mother did not die of appendicitis but disappeared when his father sent her on a covert mission . After revealing his father's true plans of using dangerous weaponry in the form of toys, Patrick, Leslie, Alsatia, Gwen and Owen launch an attack on Leland's labs to shut down his war projects. The increasingly demented General sees this as his greatest war opportunity and attempts to destroy them all. First he sends out weapons disguised as innocent looking toys, then he sends his "Tommy Tanks" and "Whirly Burly Helicopters." An intense battle takes place between Leland's toys and the original Zevo toys. Leslie manages to win the battle and along with Patrick is very angry with Leland. Suddenly Alsatia is attacked by the Sea Swine , revealing that she is a robot built by Kenneth as a play-mate for Leslie, after his mother died. While they are seeing to Leslie's sister, Leland tries to make his escape, but the malfunctioning Sea Swine tracks him down and attacks him as well resulting in his defeat. In the end, Leslie is the new head of Zevo Toys, Alsatia is fixed, Gwen becomes Leslie's girlfriend, Leland is hospitalized next to his father , and Patrick decides to move on to other missions. Before Patrick departs, he, his cousins and Gwen visit Kenneth's grave, ensuring that peace is restored to the toy factory. As the end credits roll, Kenneth's grave marker, a large toy elephant floats over the lush green pasture.
