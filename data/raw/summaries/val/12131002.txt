The film begins with the then recent US Army Ranger raid at Cabanatuan prisoner-of-war camp. The film then flashes back to 1942. As American forces under General MacArthur are forced to pull out of Bataan, Colonel Joseph Madden  of the U.S. Army, stays behind to organize guerrilla fighters against the occupying Japanese forces in the Philippines. Madden teams up with Filipino resistance fighters to liberate POW's from Cabanatuan. One of his officers, Captain Andrés Bonifácio , carries a heavy burden. Not only does he have to live up to being the grandson of Andrés Bonifacio a national hero, but his former fiancée Dalisay Delgado  is apparently collaborating with the Japanese, broadcasting propaganda over the radio.
