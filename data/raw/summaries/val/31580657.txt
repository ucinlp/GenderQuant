Jay  and Gal  are former soldiers who have become hitmen since leaving the military. While Gal is laid back, Jay is still suffering from an unspecified disastrous mission in Kiev and, despite the urging of his wife Shel , he has not worked since and they are running out of cash. Shel organises a dinner party to which she invites Gal and his latest girlfriend, a human resources manager called Fiona , and during the evening Gal reveals he has a new job for them, which Shel encourages him to take. Meanwhile Fiona goes to the toilet, carves a symbol on the back of the bathroom mirror and takes a tissue that Jay had used to mop up his blood after a shaving accident. Jay agrees to take the gig and the two meet the shadowy client who has a list of three people he wants killed and, unexpectedly, cuts Jay's hand leading to the contract being effectively signed in blood. Their first target, a priest, appears to recognise Jay and thanks him just before being killed. The second name on the list turns out to be a maker of child pornography who also thanks Jay before he is beaten to death. While Jay chases down some of the other paedophiles, Gal looks into their files and finds a folder on himself and Jay, including details of their problems in Kiev. Staking out the final mark, a Member of Parliament, they witness a strange ceremony in the woods, including a human sacrifice. They intervene but are outnumbered and get chased into a tunnel complex where Gal is stabbed to death by one of the masked pursuers. Emerging from the tunnels Jay flees to a small country house they own where Shel and Sam had gone to hide. Once there Shel arms herself, whilst Jay goes outside to find torches lit around a nearby field, and the tires slashed on the family car. Meanwhile in the house we see someone is trying to break in to the home. Outside Jay is knocked unconscious. Once he wakes up he finds himself in the field surrounded by the masked worshippers and he is confronted by his last victim "The Hunchback". After a brutal knife fight Jay triumphs, only to discover that the person he was fighting was his wife with their son Sam strapped to her back. The cultists begin to clap and as they reveal themselves it is seen that The Client, Fiona, and Jay's doctor are all members of the cult. The film ends with Jay being crowned by the cultists.
