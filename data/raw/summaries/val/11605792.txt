The film is about the 300 Spartans defending the passengers against German terrorists. The Spartans defend the entryway to the cockpit of the plane in a parallel to how the Spartans in 300 defended the narrow pass of Thermopylae. In between fighting, the terrorists' emperor Jerxes  holds audience with Leonidas while sitting on his "throne" . Jerxes criticizes Gerard Butler's performance as Leonidas in 300, by asking the Spartan King why he has to shout all of his dialogue, and pointing out that if he shouts less, the times when he does shout will have more dramatic impact. Leonidas responds to this by declaring that "I'm not yelling, I'm just passionate!" Leonidas also threatens to take the plane down, which Jerxes warns will mean that "We'll be forced to land in Ohio!" Leonidas responds, "Then tonight, we dine in Cleveland!" Ultimately, there is a comic pause in the fighting when air turbulence forces the plane's captain to put on the "wear seatbelts" sign, and the two sides glare at each other awkwardly from their seats as they wait for the turbulence to pass. At the end, Jerxes proclaims "This is madness!" and is kicked out of the plane's airlock. Leonidas responds, "This is United!"
