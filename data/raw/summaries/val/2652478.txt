Two builders buy a floorboard for a house they are constructing. They return to the house with the plank on top of a Morris Eight, but the journey is fraught with unexpected difficulties. The film is a series of "plank jokes" elaborating on the "man with a plank" slapstick routine seen in vaudeville and silent films, and adding new ones. For instance, at one point the plank is tied to the top of the car and projects backward into the open back of a large van. A man enters the back of the van and sits down. The van drives away, leaving him suspended in mid-air sitting on the end of the plank.
