Pope John Paul II, first part , begins with May 13, 1981's assassination attempt, then flashbacks to the young Karol "Lolek" Wojtyla whose faith and values are initially fostered by his loving, devout parents, who, along with Karol's elder brother, die of natural causes by the time Karol is 20 years old. Despite being on his own at a young age and enduring the effects of the Nazi occupation in Poland, the philosophical Karol remains optimistic that he can and must make a difference. Along with his university friends, Karol initially embraces the world of theatre, acting in clandestine plays as a means of retaining his Polish culture in spite of the risks involved. In the midst of the chaos surrounding him as ongoing atrocities are suffered by Polish Jews, academics, religious leaders and others, Karol accepts a calling to become a priest.  Karol's training takes place in an underground seminary run by the Archbishop Sapieha, a defiant force for the people of Kraków under the Nazi occupation, who becomes Karol's mentor and involves the young man in the resistance movement. In 1945, the Nazis are driven out of Poland and Communism soon takes over. After being ordained a priest in 1946 by Sapieha, now a Cardinal, Karol completes his graduate studies in Rome and returns to Poland, where in 1949 he is assigned to become a student chaplain at St. Florian's parish in Kraków. The athletic 28-year-old Fr. Karol Wojtyla immediately bonds with the university students who savor his relaxed approach and join him to kayak to his inspiring Masses in the wilderness away from the watchful eyes of the Communist authorities. He was then appointed Professor of Social Ethics at Catholic University of Lublin, Poland and then when Karol is only 38, the Holy See appoints him Auxiliary Bishop of Kraków. Continuing to cultivate faith with the people, despite the restrictions imposed by the Communist leaders, Karol chooses to hold Mass in an open space in the Communists' new church-free city of Nowa Huta . Although he repeatedly enrages the Communist authorities, he impresses influential foreign cardinals with his views, his charisma and his knowledge of multiple languages. At 47, Karol is made a cardinal by Pope Paul VI, who dies in August 1978. Part 2  starts on October 16, 1978, following the very brief  reign of Pope John Paul I and after 455 years of Italian popes, Karol Wojtyla is elected Pope and takes the name John Paul II at the age of 58. Later that year, he received Andrei Gromyko and questioned him about the USSR's lack of religious freedom. In January, 1979, John Paul II visited Mexico for the CELAM that was held in Puebla as one of his first papal visits outside Italy, confronting Mexico's anti-clerical constitution. In June, 1979 he made his first papal visit to his native Poland and in October, his first U.S. visit. In 1980, he pledged his support for the Solidarity trade union formed in Poland in August and in January, 1981, received Lech Walesa during his first visit to the Vatican.  During his extremely active papal years, most of them occuring after recovering from May, 1981's assassination attempt (e.g. November, 1981's appointing of then-[[Cardinal , John Paul II participates in international negotiations and urges the Soviet rulers to remove all the obstacles to freedom of religion in countries under their control. In June, 1982, he received U.S. President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan at the Vatican, returned to Poland in 1983 to visit newly-released Lech Walesa and traveled across the world to promote faith, values, peace, forgiveness , and, especially in countries lacking it, freedom of religion, as well as forgiveness and brotherhood with the Jewish people and reached out to the world's Catholic youth with World Youth Days, , as well as 1995's encyclical Letter to Women. Despite health obstacles in his later years, John Paul II refused to curtail his busy schedule. He continued to challenge and inspire millions of people throughout his lengthy illness and his later years , despite later tragedies like 2001's September 11 attacks and 2002's Catholic sex abuse scandal that included allegations of cover-ups and denials by the Church's hierarchy. The film ended in 2005 with his last Easter on March 27 and last public appearence on March 30, three days before his death on April 2.
