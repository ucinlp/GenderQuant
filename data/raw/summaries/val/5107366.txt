Jesse returns home from college following the death of his mechanic father. He hooks back up with his brother Mikey and members of the muscle car-driving gang he used to hang with. Otto, the leader of the gang, has in his possession a "speed demon," an ancient demon bound in an amulet. Mikey challenges Otto to a race and is killed when his car explodes. Grief-stricken, Jesse discovers another speed demon amulet in his home and remembers his father performing a ritual with it. Jesse performs the ritual and one by one the members of Otto's gang are killed by a mysterious black-clad helmeted driver. As his gang dwindles and desperate to cement his hold on power, Otto challenges Jesse to a showdown. He believes that Jesse has tapped the power of his speed demon. Actually, it's Jesse's girlfriend who's been acting as the masked driver all along. She destroys Otto.
