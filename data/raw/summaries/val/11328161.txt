A troubled fourteen-year-old girl named Alyssa  has been living with her Grandmother Lucy  since the death of her mother a year ago. After being suspended from school for smoking, Alyssa is brought to the Bahamas to live with Hawk , the father she never knew she had. Alyssa's arrival on the island comes at a decisively inconvenient time for Hawk, a dolphin researcher and whose prickly personality puts him at odds with local politicians who feel the local economy needs good relations with tourists. It's a difficult relationship at first between Alyssa and her father, but Tamika ([[Christine Adams , Hawk's girlfriend, and Daniel ([[George Harris , Tamika's father, smooth the way. Alyssa soon adjusts to island life and discovers the gift she shares with her father for communicating with dolphins, a skill which leads her into a powerful relationship with a wild dolphin which her father, for legitimate scientific reasons, cannot condone. But when the powers-that-be threaten to close down her father's research station, it is Alyssa and her wild friend who hold the key and have the power to bring all parties together.
