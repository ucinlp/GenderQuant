Arizona Sky is a romantic story of two high school buddies who reconnect with desire in their hearts. As the film opens, the teenegers Kyle  and Jake  are getting together for what appears to be a regular ritual of sleeping under the desert stars. The passions of first love are evident in these two young men. They eat some supper and then curl up on blankets for an evening of necking in the back of Kyle’s truck. This happy interlude is at an end, as Jake is set to move with his dad to the big city. 18 years pass and the film picks up with an adult Jake  now a successful film producer with a stressed and loveless life. After an anxiety attack, Jake’s assistant Brian  urges him to take a break from all stresses for the first time in years, encouraging him that it's time to take a vacation and step back from his troubles. This is seconded by Jake's friend Steve , who agrees to accompany Jake to his hometown in Arizona to help him find himself and unwind. Once more in Arizona, Jake finds Kyle's Aunt Elaine  listed in the local phone book. Through her he finds that Kyle  is a breakfast cook for a local diner as well as a ranch hand and mechanic with his cousin Heath . The two now-grown men reconnect and discover the spark is still there. Though Kyle is in the closet with his desires, all of his feelings spill to the surface as he and his old friend get to know each other better.
