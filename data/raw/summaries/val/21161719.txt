People refuse to believe her claims but campus talk of the Boogeyman from hearing her radio show continues to swirl.

Sarah takes over the radio station to emergency warn the students away, prompting her arrest by campus security.

Dr. Kane, trying to prove she is wrong, enters the room where the light is, and is subsequently beaten to death by the Boogeyman. Sarah then realizes the Boogeyman has been using her fear to warn everyone in order to get everyone to believe in him. Sarah rushes back to her room to save David who now believes her story and has been reading the diary. She finds him staring off into a black closet, but is unable to prevent the Boogeyman from pulling him in. David is soon-after flung out into the room, disemboweled, covering her in blood. The police and students arrive to find the scene. To prevent the Boogeyman’s growth in power, Sarah claims she committed all the murders herself and that the Boogeyman is not real. One of the officers in the elevator reveals he doesn’t believe she could have done that by herself. She insists that she did, but the elevator stops and she is pulled up into the elevator shaft by the Boogeyman with the two police officers staring in disbelief as Sarah's cries for help fade away. One year later, two Freshmen are staying in Sarah’s room. One interrupts the other’s studies to tell her the story of the “crazy girl” who thought the Boogeyman was real that lived in the room a year ago. It is revealed the college changed the dorm name to keep people from being afraid to move in. The studying girl leaves to go to the library for some peace, noticing that the other seems actually scared to be alone and taunting her as she leaves. Left alone, the other girl is soon attacked and dragged beneath her bed to an unknown fate.
