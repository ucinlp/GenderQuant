After seven years of marriage, mild-mannered Doo-hyun  is at the end of his rope. Jung-in , his wife, is beautiful, sexy, and a fantastic cook, but drives her husband crazy with her endless nagging and complaining. He can’t even bring himself to ask for a divorce because of the fights that will follow. When Doo-hyun’s company transfers him out of state, it seems like his dream of getting away is coming true. But to his horror, Jung-in surprises him by moving across the country to be with him. Desperate but too afraid to ask for a divorce, Doo-hyun recruits his next-door neighbor and legendary Casanova Seong-ki  to seduce his wife and make her leave him first. After scoping her out, Seong-ki is intrigued by the challenge and confidently agrees to seduce Jung-in as his career finale. Meanwhile, to give her something to do, Doo-hyun has already arranged for Jung-in to get a spot on the local radio station, shooting her mouth off about life's injustices. True to his reputation, Seong-ki eventually succeeds in grabbing Jung-in’s attention, and the two slowly develop feelings for each other. But though Doo-hyun asked for it, he grows to regret his decision and decides to spy on his wife and her lover.CJ Entertainment Reveals Everything about my Wife HanCinema.
