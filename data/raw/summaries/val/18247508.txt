Three friends, Fred , Tyg  and Grouch , set out on a motorcycle trip to Wales in order to bring back a haul of cannabis for Fred's friend The Chairman . What was meant to be a nice weekend in the country soon turns into an ordeal. Along the way, they encounter revenge seeking bikers and a giant masked wrestler in the pub. Or maybe it's just those magic mushrooms they had for breakfast.
