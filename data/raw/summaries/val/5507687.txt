Raymond Ayala  stars as Edgar Dinero, a young man from the streets of Puerto Rico who gets tangled between the thug life of his neighborhood and the beat of his barrio. On that path Edgar encounters disruption among his crew men, while falling in love with an uptown girl from whom Dinero must conceal his strong ties with the violent barrio underworld. The movie was mostly shot in the Jose Gautier Ben√≠tez public housing project, and also in Barriada Morales, both barrios kings in the underworld in Caguas, PR. Other places used were Puerto Nuevo, in San Juan, and New York City.
