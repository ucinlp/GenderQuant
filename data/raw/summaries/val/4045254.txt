Peter Loew , is a driven literary agent, who is slowly going insane. He works all day, and club hops at night, with little in his life but one night stands and the pursuit of money and prestige. He sees a therapist  frequently, and during these sessions, his declining mental health becomes clear through a series of increasingly bizarre rants that eventually begin to scare even his psychiatrist. Loew meets Rachel  at a night club, and takes her home. She pins him down, reveals fangs, and feeds on him. He soon begins to believe that he is changing into a vampire. He stares into a bathroom mirror and fails to see his reflection; he wears dark sunglasses during the day; and, when his "fangs" fail to develop, he purchases a pair of cheap plastic vampire teeth and uses them to attack a woman at a nightclub. All the while, Rachel visits him nightly to feed on his blood. A subplot concerns a secretary working at Loew's office, Alva Restrepo . Loew torments her by forcing her to search through an enormous file for a 1963 contract. When she fails to find the contract, he at first browbeats and humiliates her, then visits her at home, and finally attacks and attempts to rape her. Later, Loew has a brief, ambiguous encounter with Rachel in a club: she admits to knowing him, but gives the impression that they have not been in contact for a long period. He accuses her of being a vampire, and is expelled from the club. Loew wanders the streets in a blood-spattered business suit, talking to himself, and using his now disastrous apartment as a vampire's cave where he hides from the sun by crawling under an upturned sofa. In a hallucinatory exchange, he tells his therapist that he may have murdered someone, and may have raped his secretary. Alva, however, believes she has been raped, and Loew is soon killed by Alva's brother.
