The Little Man and his Little dog are out camping one night, unaware that the Pink Panther is sleeping on a tree branch just above them. Due to the Little Man's snoring, the panther cannot sleep, so he cuts loose the man's hammock with a knife, sending him flying straight to the river. When the dog hears the man's scream for help, he grips the knife in his mouth, and seeing this, the man blames the dog for what has happened. Later, the panther attaches the little man's hammock above the campfire, and sends the tent with the man in it floating down the river towards a waterfall.
