Sam Roffe, President of Roffe & Sons Pharmaceuticals, dies in a climbing accident leaving his daughter Elizabeth  a billion-dollar empire. Roffe's board members thus see the opportunity to settle old scores, jockey for higher positions, and reap lucrative profits. However, an investigation into Sam's accident uncovers a murder and a nefarious power struggle within the company. Lead investigator Max Hornung  informs Elizabeth of his list of suspects that includes her closest advisers and financially strapped family members. During this time she marries CEO Rhys Williams , but he, too, is identified by Hornung as a suspect. As president, Elizabeth refuses to let shares of Roffe & Sons sell on the world market. Her choice prevents the board members from selling their shares of stocks  and therefore remain in financial misery. Her death would allow for a unanimous decision to sell the board's stocks and get the money. After several attempts on her life an international chase ensues with Elizabeth unable to trust anyone.
