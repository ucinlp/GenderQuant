After the death of his owner Mr. Wing , the mogwai Gizmo  becomes the guinea pig of the mad scientists working at Clamp Enterprises, an automatic state-of-the-art office building in Manhattan, run by the eccentric billionaire Daniel Clamp ([[John Glover . Seemingly at the mercy of the chief researcher Dr. Catheter , Gizmo reunites with his friend Billy Peltzer  and his fiancee Katie , both who work at Clamp Enterprises. Clamp himself visits and quickly befriends Billy upon being impressed by his skills in concept design, also sparking the interest of Billy's superior Marla Bloodstone . Gizmo is left in the office and spawns a new batch of mogwai when he gets wet, including Mohawk  who is the reincarnation of Stripe. The new batch eat after midnight and transform into Gremlins. While Mohawk tortures Gizmo, the other Gremlins cause the fire sprinklers to go off in a cooking show's studio and spawn an army of Gremlins which quickly throw the building into chaos. Billy quickly comes up with an idea to lure the Gremlins outside into sunlight by covering the front of the building in a giant sheet depicting nighttime, Clamp personally escaping outside to lead the plan. The Gremlins invade the laboratory, one devouring a brain serum and becoming the intelligent Brain Gremlin  who plans to inject a genetic sunblock formula into the army so they can survive in sunlight. Other Gremlins devour serums and are genetically altered, including an electrical Gremlin which Billy traps in Clamp's answering machine. All the while "Grandpa Fred"  catches the chaos on camera, broadcasting it to the world; he dreams of being a proper anchorman but only works at Clamp Enterprises as an actor. Murray Futterman , Billy's neighbor from Kingston Falls and former victim of the Gremlin's antics, visits New York City with his wife Sheila  and, upon encountering a Gremlin that consumed a bat serum, sneaks into the Clamp building to aid Billy. Billy, Dr. Catheter, and the chief of security Forster  team up to defeat the Gremlins, but Dr. Catheter is killed by the electric Gremlin and Forster is chased off by a female lovestruck Gremlin. Mohawk finishes torturing Gizmo and devours a spider serum, transforming into a monstrous half-Gremlin half-spider hybrid. He attacks Kate and Marla, but Gizmo  confronts Mohawk and kills him with an ignited bottle of white-out. Outside the building, a rainstorm frustrates Clamp's plan as the Gremlins gather in the building's foyer. Billy formulates a second plan to kill the Gremlin army: having Mr. Futterman spray the army with water and then releasing the electrical Gremlin, electrocuting and killing all of the army including the Brain Gremlin. Clamp charges in with the police and press, but is so thrilled by the end result that he gives Billy, Katie, Fred and Marla promotions and gives Grandpa Fred a job as an anchorman and gives Mr. Katsuji  who is a photographer and cameraman a job to be Grandpa Fred's cameraman while Clamp decides to start a new project based on Kingston Falls' tranquil setting from Billy's drawing. Forster calls Clamp where he is trapped inside a restroom in one of the higher levels of the building with the female Gremlin . The female Gremlin approaches Forster in a wedding dress. Forster shrugs and resigns himself to his fate.
