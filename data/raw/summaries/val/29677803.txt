A story of a simpleton whose life changes when he becomes the owner of a private bus.Deepak ([[Govinda  is a simpleton. He has been switching jobs as he does not want to succumb to the corrupt system. Since years, with unwavering efforts, financial hardships and an unshaken faith in the judicial systems, he has been helping his father Omkarnathji  in a legal matter. Omkarnathji, the ex-principal of a private school, is fighting a court case against the school to get his due provident fund and pension. He later wins the case and the school is ordered to give a part of its property as compensation, if there is no money in its funds. And thus Deepak's life gets an addition: a bus. Instead of selling it off, acting on his father's advice, he decides to run the bus. While the rest of the family members - two sisters: Chhaya and Aprana  and their Ghar-Jamaaee husbands Vinayak Agrawal, a Lawyer ([[Asrani  and U.U. Upadhyay  are against it. They feel it's a low profile job. Their primary interest is in selling off the huge bus and devouring their share of property. But Deepak has immense trust in his father's judgment. Sundar  a jolly good sweetheart, who is desperately trying for an American Visa, is also an age old friend. He comes in handy with initial investments and they establish a company, Chal Chala Chal transport. And so begins the ride of their lives. The bus is in a dilapidated condition and much of money is gone for the repairs. It's a roller-coaster ride where mishaps are more than the commuters. The bus driver, Basantilal  wears thick glasses and the conductor Harilal  has a sugar factory in his mouth and an eye for cash... adding to it like a cherry on the triple-decker pastry- Sunder's enmity with a rat which has eaten his passport. Corruption chases Deepak in transport business as well U.U. Upadhyay is a chief vehicle inspector. He tried his level best to harass Deepak and extort money, raising troubles. These workers are messing up Deepak's life and business, but he can't raise a finger against them, for they are under the cushioned wings of the Union Leader Mr. Singh . They only relief should have been the lovely lady on the bus Payal , but the bus hits her fracturing her leg. Now she is also in the vengeance mode, extorting money from Deepak. What saves Deepak from these mad house characters, is his faith in his principals and his father's love-acting as the strong backbone in bitter sweet times.
