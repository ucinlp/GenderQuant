The siblings and Henry eventually travel to Michigan to make an impromptu appearance at the Pierces' house and confront Megan.{{r}}{{r}} When they travel to Angela's house, she takes a while to answer the door, but she appears very happy to see them. She casually announces that she will begin chemotherapy for uterine cancer soon. She drives them to see Abby, who says "you're confusing me" when Nev repeatedly asks her about her art. The next morning, Nev wakes up to a text message from Megan saying that she was checking in to rehab and that she would not be able to meet him. A Facebook message from one of Megan's friends confirms that she is checking in to rehab. Later that day, Nev suggests to Angela that they have a serious talk, and she breaks down, admitting to making everything up. She claims that the pictures of Megan she used were from a friend of a friend, and Angela worries that she betrayed her. In fact, the pictures are from a completely unrelated woman from Washington. Unable to stop lying, Angela claims that her real daughter Megan really is in rehab downstate, but it turns out that Megan has been estranged from the family for a long time. All of the artwork that Abby was supposed to have created was actually by Angela. Nev spends some time sitting for a portrait with Angela, and they talk more about her lies. She confesses that all the various personae were fragments of her personality, usually enacting some fantasy of what her life would have been like if she had not made the choices she had. Her husband Vince is under the illusion that Nev is a patron of Angela's, commissioning all the artwork that she sent to him. Vince has twin sons with severe disabilities from a previous marriage. Sitting on his front porch, Vince tells the story that gives the film its name. He claims that when live cod were shipped to Asia from North America, the fish's inactivity in their tanks resulted in mushy flesh in the Asian markets. Eventually, the fishermen discovered that putting catfish in the tanks with the cod kept them active. Vince feels that people like Angela are catfish, who keep other people active in life.
