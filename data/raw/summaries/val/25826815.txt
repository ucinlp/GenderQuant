 Dr. Roman Nycz  has been diagnosed with impotence, his friend and colleague confirms the prognosis, suggesting that he should divorce his beautiful young wife, Hanka  a stewardess for KLM. They love each other too much and simply cannot do it. Hanka says to Roman that there are more important things in a relationship between two people than sex and that she will manage living without it, but Roman encourages Hanka to find a lover if she does not have one already, she says that she will not do it and that they should not discuss this problem to death. Roman is teased by an attractive young singer who must undergo heart surgery. Earlier that morning he notices a young man around his building who at the sight of him walks away and disappears. He becomes suspicious and bugs his own phone to eavesdrop on Hanka. He finds out that she does have a younger boyfriend, Mariusz , a physics student, with whom she has a purely physical relationship. Their trysts happen at her mother's house. One day, Hanka forgets some items that her mother wanted from her house and asks Roman to retrieve them for her; while in the house he snoops around and finds a notebook that he had earlier found in his car. He also makes duplicate keys. In the meantime, Hanka tries to end the relationship with Mariusz. He says that he loves her and wants to marry her but it is over. As she is about to leave she sees Roman hidden in the closet and is very unpleasantly surprised, as she tries to console Roman she agrees that they should discuss his problem to death and agrees to look for a child to adopt, since initially they had not wanted children but now have come to the conclusion that this problem would be a lot easier if they had a child. Hanka goes on a skiing trip alone but she does not know that Mariusz has followed her there. Roman has also spotted Mariusz preparing his skiing gear onto his car and calls his house posing as a faculty member, but his mother tells him that Mariusz has left for a trip to the same destination as Hanka. When Hanka and Mariusz meet, she thinks suddenly of Roman and fears that he might do something stupid, which in fact he does as he tries to commit suicide, but survives. http://www.film.u-net.com/Movies/Reviews/Dekalog_9.html Episode review http://www.facets.org/decalogue/synopsis.html Episode synopsis http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/decalogue_vol_4_parts_viii_and_ix/# Episode Synopsis and critical review
