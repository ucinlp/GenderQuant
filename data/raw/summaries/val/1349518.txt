Fernand Naudin is an ex-gangster, who now deals in agricultural machinery and lives in Montauban. His modest, quiet life is disrupted when his childhood friend, who has become the Boss of a gangster organisation, summons him to his death bed. He has to take care of his friend's "business" and of his daughter, Patricia, who only thinks about having fun and has never been kept in a college for more than six months. As if it wasn't enough, by taking the Boss's  golden seat, Fernand angers most of the other gangsters who hoped to become the new Boss and during the movie, he escapes many murder attempts by people inside the organisation.
