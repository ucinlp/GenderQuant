He gets in a conversation between Nagma  and Farhan where she identifies Faizal as a terminal junkie incapable of exacting revenge for the family.

After Faizal and Mohsina's ([[Huma Qureshi  marriage, Faizal kills Sultan's men who were involved in the murder of his father and his brother. Sultan, still oblivious of the truce between the Singhs and the Khans, calls Ramadhir, asking for permission to retaliate. A 14-yr-old Babua Khan robs local stores on the pretext of being Faizal's brother. An opportunistic Definite Khan , Faizal's stepbrother, also a nuisance to the public, aspires to become a gangster. Though being brought up in Ramadhir Singh's household, he grows to idolize Faizal and thus double-crosses Singh. At the instigation of local shopkeepers, Perpendicular is murdered by Sultan Qureshi. At the same time, Shamshad Alam, on being caught short-changing Faizal, rats on Faizal's illegal operation to the police and gets him arrested. In order to gain Faizal's appreciation, Definite attacks Shamshad Alam, grievously injuring him. Faizal, however, comes under the sway of Ikhlakh who, unknown to him, is Ramadhir Singh's mole; and in his greed for money, ignores Definite who eventually grows estranged from him. Faizal decides to join politics and contest a rigged election against Ramadhir Singh. After Faizal's release, Sultan in a last-ditch effort, arranges an ambush on the Khan mansion to eliminate Faizal and his whole family  but everyone escapes unharmed.

With Definite's help, Sultan is tracked and gunned down. On the voting day, Ikhlakh takes Faizal to a deserted place in the intention to kill him but Definite double-crosses Ikhlakh and kills him. Definite informs Faizal that Ramadhir is in the same hospital where Shamshad has been admitted. Before they part, Mohsina tells Faizal that she is pregnant, leaving very little effect on Faizal who is determined to kill Ramadhir. Faizal and Definite reach the hospital along with a handful of men. Faizal alone slaughters all of Ramadhir's men leaving Definite and the others outside to keep the police at bay. Faizal kills Shamshad, and finally finds Ramadhir hiding in the hospital's toilet.

He walks towards J.P. and Durga, knowing that both their wishes are fulfilled.
