Suddha depicts the death of the feudal system that existed among the Tulu speaking community in coastal Karnataka and the impact the land ceiling act, ushered during the sixties and seventies, has had on its social structure. It is the story of modern India - of changing caste equations and a realization of this reality among the land owning class, albeit a bit late. Though the film is set in a remote village near Mangalore, it could well have happened in any other village elsewhere in India. An ex-landlord family comes to terms with the fact that they are living in their last leg of feudal existence when it cannot perform a last rites in a grand manner in which it was once used to.
