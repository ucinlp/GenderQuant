David, a 16-year-old homophobe, shows up at the doorstep of Den's Hollywood Hills home and discovers both his famous dad and his and younger lover Colin. Colin is a former dancer, now using a wheelchair. Though their relationship is secret, Den and Colin are committed to each other, something they hope will improve David's disposition, given his rocky adolescence. Their otherwise seemingly idyllic and coveted life is permanently altered, as they are forced to confront an already problematic relationship. Eventually, all three men with the help of their unconventional and extended family are compelled to join together and redefine the concept of family.
