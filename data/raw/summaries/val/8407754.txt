This cartoon begins with Marvin the Martian observing the planet Earth from Mars through a telescope. He is examining a rocket launch that is taking place. As he watches, the rocket takes off from Earth and soon appears to be heading straight towards him. Soon enough, the rocket lands on Mars, and a reluctant Bugs Bunny exits it. It is quickly apparent that he is the only occupant and he has been lured onto the rocket by a carrot and then sent to Mars as what Earth considered an expendable “astro-rabbit.” Bugs immediately claims Mars as his own , in the name of Earth. However Marvin does not agree with this and decides that he will not allow Bugs to take his planet away from him. After failing to disintegrate him with his disintegrating pistol , Marvin gets his Time-Space Gun and intends to project Bugs forward into time so he can use him as a useful but harmless slave. However, when Marvin zaps Bugs , he realises too late that he had the gun in reverse, so Bugs is reverted into a huge and muscular Neanderthal Rabbit, who immediately grabs Marvin and crushes him with just one hand; Marvin goes off to be regenerated again, while saying: "Well, back to the old electronic brain!" . Bugs then eats the metal carrot and breaks the fourth Wall while speaking to the audience about how when he gets back to Earth old Elmer Fudd and the rest of the hunters are due for a big surprise!
