Three terminally ill war veterans escape from a Helsinki cancer ward to taste life once more. The men make their way to Turku to meet the daughter of one of them, now married to a rich architect. When they arrive, however, the daughter is off in the Caribbean and the house is filled with middle-aged men wearing tuxedos and young women wearing almost nothing. After creating havoc in this secret brotherhood ceremony, the trio slowly heads towards a ferry that would take them to Stockholm.
