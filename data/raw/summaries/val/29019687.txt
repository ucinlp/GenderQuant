Sosa is a lawyer recently expelled from the bar association who works as an ambulance chaser - known as "Carancho" in Argentina - touring the emergency departments of the public hospitals and the police stations, in search of potential clients for his barely-legal law firm. One night he meets Luján, a young paramedic recently arrived from the provinces trying to get an internship as a surgeon. The two start a romantic relationship that is threatened when Sosa breaks his bond with his corrupt boss. When Sosa is about to get back his attorney registration, and while making amends for his bad deeds, he and Luján are attacked by former partners of the firm, initiating an escalation of violence.
