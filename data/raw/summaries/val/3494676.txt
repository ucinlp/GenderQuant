Last season, the Cleveland Indians won the division title by beating the New York Yankees in a one-game playoff, but they were defeated in the ALCS by the Chicago White Sox. The success of last season has changed the attitudes of the Indians. Pitching sensation Ricky "Wild Thing" Vaughn  is now a bland yuppie concerned about his endorsement potential, causing him to lose the edge on his fastball. Home run hitter Pedro Cerrano  underwent a spiritual conversion, from aggressive voodoo to placid Buddhism, which affects his competitive spirit. Conceited player Roger Dorn  retired and bought the team from Rachel Phelps . Aging catcher Jake Taylor  has also retired to become one of the coaches who work for manager Lou Brown . And Willie Mays Hayes  is still as fast as ever, but he has added some power to his hitting and a sprained knee from performing stunts in his new movie. However, Dorn signs arrogant power hitting catcher Jack Parkman  as an offseason free agent, and minor league catcher Rube Baker  makes the team out of spring training, despite his throwing problem. The Indians get off to another slow start, as egos clash. The signing of Jack Parkman has put Dorn in a financially tough spot, as well as putting a strain on the clubhouse, so Dorn trades Parkman to the Chicago White Sox, the team that defeated the Indians in the playoffs last season, keeping them from the World Series. In return, the Indians receive Isuro "Kamikaze" Tanaka , a gifted left fielder with a penchant for crashing into the walls. Dorn, still short on money, sells the team back to Rachel, but is retained as General Manager. He then announces his comeback to the majors and returns to the team, but cannot regain his former form. Rachel sees this as an opportunity to get revenge on the Indians for what happened last season, so she tries to find ways to make them have a losing season this time. When Lou has a heart attack, he gets Jake to take over as the Indians' interim manager. Baker and Tanaka aid Hayes and Cerrano  regain their competitiveness, and the Indians begin to win again. A notable turning point to the season comes after an emotional victory in Game 2 of a double-header against the Boston Red Sox. The Indians clinch the division on the last game of the year against the Toronto Blue Jays, giving the team their second consecutive division title. They go on to face the Chicago White Sox in the ALCS. The Indians take a 3-0 lead in the ALCS against the White Sox, but in the next three games Jack Parkman scorches the Indians forcing a Game 7. In Game 7, Vaughn finds the "Wild Thing," and retires Parkman for the final out, as the Indians would go on to defeat the White Sox sending them to the World Series.
