Energenic Egghead is bouncing around, pretending to be a cowboy, until his noise-making gets him kicked out of the boarding house in which he is living by a clerk with a penchant for the minced oath "dad-burnit." While on the street he sees a discarded newspaper advertisement from a ranch in Wyoming, requesting a "cow-puncher." He applies, and, while there, goes through various training exercises, but fails them all. Egghead, having seen his apparent uselessness, begins to leave, but the lead cowboy decides to give him a job: cleaning up after the cows and horses.
