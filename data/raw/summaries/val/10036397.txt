The film begins where the original television series finishes, with Gordon Shumway&mdash;otherwise known by the name ALF, standing for Alien Life Form&mdash;being captured by the US Air Force's Alien Task Force while attempting to depart Earth. ALF is kept under lock and key at Edmonds Air Force Base under the xenophobic orders of Colonel Milfoil , although he manages to charm his airmen jailers and convert his cell into a bachelor pad. Acting on his own initiative, Milfoil plans on killing his prisoner under the guise of a beauty treatment for which he has left a paper trail implicating his aide de camp, Lieutenant Reese , as scapegoat. Learning of this, two Air Force scientists&mdash;Major Mellisa Hill  and Capt. Rick Mullican ([[William O'Leary  &mdash; help ALF escape, going to ground at a cheap motel. After ALF makes a nuisance of himself, he is ordered to "Go hide in the restroom!" an order that reminds him of when the Tanners would give him similar directions. Unwilling to do without his creature comforts, ALF sneaks outside and contacts one of his former guards in an attempt to arrange a supply drop, before mistakenly entering a Strip Club assuming from its name that it is an eating establishment that serves cats. With both the local police and the military alerted, the three of them turn to Dexter Moyers , a former NASA scientist falsely discredited by the government as part of the anti-UFO conspiracy. His solution is to publicly reveal ALF's existence on global television, removing the US Government's credibility and vindicating himself, but Rick grows increasingly uncomfortable with the idea. After accidentally stumbling across a computer file that hints at a deeper agenda, Rick departs during the night. The following day, he contacts a friend at Edmonds, aware that Milfoil will be monitoring the conversation and come directly to him. As predicted, he is arrested shortly after and brokers a deal exchanging safe conduct for the three fugitives in return for revealing the impending broadcast. Meanwhile, Mellisa learns that Moyers has set up a secret auction alongside the broadcast, intending to sell the alien to the highest bidder. After she refuses to take part, he imprisons her. Alf, unaware of the betrayal, revels in being the center of attention until stage fright and the increasing hostility of his host result in ALF locking himself in the bathroom which provides the military with the time to shut down the broadcast. Both Melissa and ALF are arrested, and Milfoil reneges on the deal. In doing so, he unwittingly reveals his murderous intentions on a security recording which finds its way into the hands of Lt. Reese. Back at Edmonds, Milfoil gloats that ALF's escape means he will be able to convince his superiors to have the alien executed openly, Milfoil's hatred being revealed as seeking payback for his mother going mad as the result of alleged alien abduction. However, Reese interrupts a meeting between Milfoil and General Stone to play the tape, revealing the Colonel's malfeasance. It's not shown what happens to Milfoil after his exposure, but it is implied that he gets fired from the Air Force and is sent to jail for the rest of his life. A military panel authorizes promotions for the three officers involved in taking down Milfoil, and apologizing to ALF before declaring him an ambassador to Earth. Naturally, the scene ends with ALF's usual self-aggrandizing behavior leaving the people on the panel to wonder if they've made the right choice.
