Humphrey the Bear oversleeps through the opening of hunting season one year. While the other bears flee to the safety of their cave, Humphrey is left outside and is forced to hide in a nearby cabin instead. Inside the cabin, Humphrey is horrified to learn that it is a hunting lodge, made evident by the many guns and hunting trophies hanging on the walls. As the bear turns to leave, he sees Donald Duck coming down the path toward the cabin carrying a rifle. Humphrey desperately looks for a hiding place inside the cabin. At last he notices a large bear skin rug in front of the fireplace. He quickly rolls up the rug, stows it in an empty trunk, and lays out flat on the floor in the rug's place. Just then, Donald enters and is unaware that his "rug" has been replaced, or that it is a real bear. Humphrey nervously endures several uncomfortable and painful experiences, all the while being careful not to let Donald know that he is a real bear. These include hiccups, a burning ember from the fireplace falling on his fur, going through Donald's clothes washer and dryer, and being mowed with a reel mower among other things. Off screen Humphrey spends the rest of hunting season in Donald's cabin carrying on his rug masquerade. When hunting season is over, Donald finally leaves and Humphrey breaths a sigh of relief. But just then Humphrey hears a sound from the trunk in the corner. Humphrey learns, much to his chagrin, that the bearskin rug which he had rolled up and stowed earlier was actually another bear who had also masqueraded as a rug. The film ends with the other bear leaving and thanking Humphrey for taking his place.
