En route to California to prospect for gold, Hooker , Fiske , and Luke Daly  stop over in a tiny Mexican village. The three men and Vicente Madariaga  are hired by a desperate Leah Fuller  to rescue her husband John , who is trapped in a gold mine in hostile Indian territory. During the harrowing journey, the party's already frayed nerves are aggravated when the men become attracted to the woman. The group then arrives at the mine site â€” called the "Garden of Evil" because the Indians regard it as the domain of evil spirits. They find an injured, but living John Fuller. As they leave, they are pursued by Apaches. Eventually, only Hooker, Fiske and Leah are left alive. At a narrow point in the road, the two men draw cards to see who will stay behind to hold off the Indians while the other two ride to safety. Fiske "wins" and succeeds in killing or driving off the enemy. After seeing that Leah is safe, Hooker returns to talk with a dying Fiske, who urges him to settle down with Leah.
