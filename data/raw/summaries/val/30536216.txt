P. Madhavan Nair  is a middle-aged man who has come to toil in the deserts of the Middle East to fulfil his responsibilities to his family of two younger sisters who must be married, and a father whose debt has to be paid. He has neither found the time to get married nor to have a life of his own. It goes without saying that he is golden-hearted and honest to the core. So much so, that his filthy-rich boss , who splurges on expensive art , and beautiful women, shares with our hero the code of the locker where he stacks all his money, and promotes him to chief accountant. Madhavan Nair falls for Meenakshi  who he meets in a jewellery shop, where they both select the same ring. As it happens, there is only a single piece and both are ready to sacrifice their choice for the other. They then spend the day together and cupid gets busily to work.
