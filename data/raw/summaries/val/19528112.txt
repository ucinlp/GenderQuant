Essentially a remake of 1949's Se√±or Droopy, but taking in a medieval setting rather than the country of Mexico, One Droopy Knight casts Droopy and his rival Spike as medieval knights out to slay a dragon and win the hand of a beautiful human princess. However, the dragon considers both as nothing more than minor nuisances. Droopy though, takes more chances to slay the dragon, but it thinks Droopy is small and harmless. Meanwhile, Spike is being foiled after being molded into a metal can. Droopy however, bangs a mace on the dragon's tail and says,"Take that you no good dragon!" Once again the dragon single-handedly flicks Droopy away. Spike comes back riding on a steed. Suddenly, the dragon blows fire on Spike and the horse, leaving them naked. Spike gives up and goes away, while Droopy stands and cries looking at a picture of the princess. The dragon draws a French moustache on the photo and laughs outrageously. Droopy calmly gets mad and says one of his catchphrases,"You know what? That makes me mad." Then he beats up the dragon and wins the heart of the princess.
