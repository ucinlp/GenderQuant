The plot centralizes around ex-Vietnam veteran and ex-Green Beret Captain, Slaughter . The film begins with a nicely-dressed African American couple being killed by a car bomb. It then is revealed that the man and woman were the parents of Slaughter, who subsequently is obsessed with avenging their murder. He learns that it was arranged by a Cleveland mafia gang, and starts to track down the mobster who was personally responsible, killing a mafia member in the process. The murderer, however, manages to escape. Slaughter gets arrested and charged with first degree murder, but the FBI offers to drop all charges if he agrees to go to Mexico in order to hunt down and kill the escaped mobster, a deal that Slaughter readily accepts. After arriving to Mexico he meets up with American law enforcement officials in charge of monitoring local crime bosses. It is revealed that the mobster responsible for the murder of Slaughter's parents is a man named Dominic Hoff. After many fights, gun battles and car chases, Slaughter succeeds in killing Hoff by incinerating him alive in his crashed car.
