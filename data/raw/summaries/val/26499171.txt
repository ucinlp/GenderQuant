A Boy Called Dad tells the story of Robbie, a fourteen-year-old boy who has just become a father. Robbie wishes to take responsibility for his baby son, Elliot, but the mother wants nothing more to do with him. A near-accident reunites Robbie with his estranged father, Joe, and for a while their relationship flourishes. But Joe proves a feckless, unreliable man, and Robbie realizes he does not want to be the same kind of father to his own child. After seeing the baby with his mother and her abusive new boyfriend, Robbie decides to take action. Confrontation leads to violence, and Robbie kidnaps his son and goes on the run. Travelling cross-country, he meets Nia, a traumatized young woman who has some ugly family issues to resolve. Meanwhile an increasingly guilt-ridden Joe searches for Robbie, trying to guess where he might go next. His search leads to a final confrontation between Joe and Robbie, in which each is forced to face up to the past. The police soon arrive and Robbie gives Joe his son. In the end, Robbie says "People say when you're drowning, you think about your life. But I didn't, I thought about my son Elliot's life."
