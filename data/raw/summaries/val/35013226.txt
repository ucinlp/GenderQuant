In 1961, in a little village in the middle of the Guinean tropical forest, a music band is born. This band will soon become one of the biggest orchestras of modern Africa. It is Bembeya Jazz. This orchestra, symbolizing the Guinean revolution of Ségou Touré, managed to rock the whole African continent with their music. Forty years later, we go back to its roots. Besides the difficulties, the “Bembeya mystery” is still alive: the legend continues!
