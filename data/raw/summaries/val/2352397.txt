Based on Augusten Burroughs' memoir of the same name, the film is a semi-autobiographical account of Burroughs' childhood. His mother, Deidre , perceiving an ill-fated upbringing, places him under the care of her unorthodox psychiatrist, Dr. Finch ([[Brian Cox , the eccentric patriarch of an oddball family. At the age of 12, Burroughs  finds himself in Victorian squalor living an unconventional youth among the doctorâ€™s family, and is subject to irregular visits by his increasingly unsound mother. At one point, Burroughs befriends Neil Bookman , Finch's adopted 33-year-old son, and the two enter an erratic sexual relationship. The story is of a childhood in which the boundary between reality and fantasy is ignored and finally broken; as, ultimately, is the irreplaceable bond between mother and son.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0439289/
