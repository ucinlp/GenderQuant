The movie is set in London in 1914, on the eve of World War I. 1914 was the year Chaplin made his first movie. Calvero , once a famous stage clown but now a washed-up drunk, saves a young dancer, Thereza Ambrose, alias Terry , from suicide. Nursing her back to health, Calvero helps Terry regain her self-esteem and resume her dancing career. In doing so he regains his own self-confidence, but his attempts to make a comeback are less successful. Terry says she wants to marry Calvero despite their age difference, although she has befriended Neville, a young composer Calvero believes would be better suited to her. In order to give them a chance Calvero leaves home and becomes a street entertainer. Terry, now starring in her own show, eventually finds Calvero and persuades him to return to the stage for a benefit concert. Reunited with an old partner , Calvero gives a triumphant comeback performance but immediately suffers a heart attack and dies in the wings while just a few feet away Terry, the second act on the bill, dances on stage. This represents the end of a generation and the coming of another. The fading of age and the emergence of youth... under the Limelight, as said during the initial credits.
