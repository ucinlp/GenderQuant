Ordinary humans led by King Bantayan are being annihilated by the all-powerful evil king Bagulbol and his creatures of the dark. To end their tribulation, mankindâ€™s leaders paid a mercenary with exceptional fighting skills to defend them. That mercenary is Exodus. Nearing their extinction, King Bantayan and the leaders of men dispatched Exodus on a quest to capture five elementals to aid them in the final battle against King Bagulbol. Exodus was able to convince the last Earth, Wind, Fire, and Water elementals and they became allies in ridding the land of evil. Exodus and his enchanted friends were victorious. They conquered humankind's greatest enemy and peace was again established.
