Jane Alexander is a sheltered, attractive widow living with her family in San Francisco. For six years she's been living with Tom O'Donnell, her charismatic and handsome boyfriend. He uses wit, charm, and tales of adventure to borrow money for extensive home business operations and investing. When her favorite 88 year old aunt was gruesomely murdered in San Jose, she worked closely with police detective Jack Morris to solve the case. Morris soon convinces her that the killer is her boyfriend, and after O'Donnell disappears with over $10,000 of her money and leaves her near bankruptcy, Jane embarks on an epic journey to outsmart the wily con-artist. The police are soon stumped, but after 13 years of collecting evidence on their own, Alexander and Morris manage to convict O'Donnell of first degree murder.<ref namehttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1415256/ |title |first |publisher2009-07-25}} <ref namehttp://www.redroom.com/publishedwork/citizen-jane |titleDalessandro |first |publisher2009-07-25}}
