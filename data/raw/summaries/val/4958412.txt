Johnny Walker  is the top high school quarterback prospect who is heavily recruited by many schools. His best friend, Leo Wiggins , thinks he should hold out for the best offer. His girlfriend, Georgia , wants him to go to State with her and get a solid education. The colleges offer him everything he could possibly want â€” girls, cars, cash, free room and board, etc. Although he has all the skills a coach would want in a quarterback, he is unsure where he wants to go. Although Johnny lives with his mother, grandfather and younger brother and sister, he is offered everything and anything by every interested college except for the local State College.
