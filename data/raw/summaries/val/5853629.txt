The movie opens with a shot of George W. Bush delivering the State of the Union address and cross-dissolves into a newspaper headline about the Madrid train bombings of 2004. The audio is composed primarily of a ringing telephone. A young man named John O'Hara  is shown lying on his bed and looking depressed. The audio segues from the ringing phone to a conversation with his father wherein his father urges him to get a job and then, as if to undercut his son's confidence, offers to mail him a check. John, apparently bored, leaves the apartment, bringing the newspaper along with him. The next scene takes place in a restaurant, as John enters and sits at the bar. A beautiful blonde sizes him up as he takes the stool next to her. After much glancing back and forth, she begins a conversation with him wherein she flatters him and, apparently mistaking him for being wealthy because he's not working and is reading the stock market section of the newspaper, tries to pick him up. John responds to her questions cautiously. She then hands him her business card, which reads "Sofia's Strip-o-Gram and Massage Service". Sofia  offers John a massage and a humorous exchange ensues. After he makes her laugh, she invites him to get stoned. John pays for both of their drinks, and the pair leaves. There is a cross-dissolve to John and Sofia standing in front of a shop window, inside of which is a luxurious display of chocolates. John declares that "it's the most expensive chocolate shop in the world", to which an entranced Sofia replies, "I know". John, attempting to be charming, offers to buy them each a chocolate. Sofia, saying that she needs to check her messages, tells him to go in and pick something out for her. John, surprised, goes inside. The soundtrack then changes to that of people frolicking at the beach as John enters. As he approaches the counter, the audio again changes&nbsp;— this time to both an airport interior and a German voice repeating a phrase again and again. As John reaches the counter, the salesgirl wraps up two lemon-mousse finger sandwiches for him. In superimposition, the elaborate ritual of preparing the cakes is shown. John pays a whopping $42.50 for the two treats and leaves. In the last scene, John and Sofia sit on the Brooklyn Bridge after having gotten stoned together. Sofia then opens up to John and tells him that she used to live with her ex-boyfriend and sometimes delivered drugs for him. She describes two trips that she took&nbsp;— one to a college in Vermont and another to Belgium and Prague. She then tells John the story of how her boyfriend was murdered and she was raped repeatedly by the killers. When John is shocked, she insists that she's fine now, as the event took place a year ago. John embraces her awkwardly, retracts his arm hurriedly, and then Sofia tells him to call her before leaving for an appointment. John then eats the cakes.
