Deb and Sisi follows homely Deborah Dyer  who tries everything she can to “suicide herself” when she finds herself still single on her 40th birthday. But all attempts fail as fate sends her car swerving right into Sisi Sickles , a recently evicted promiscuous alcoholic. Seeing an opportunity for a quick buck, Sisi is soon at Deb’s doorstep with a "broken umbilical cord or two". Stricken with guilt, a naïve Deb postpones her self-destructive plans to take care of Sisi, but quickly discovers that killing herself might be an easier option after all.
