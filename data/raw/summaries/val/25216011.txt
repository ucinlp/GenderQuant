Successful authoress Beatrice Lynn is commissioned by her publisher to go to the Outback and locate the legendary white man, Mala, who heads an aboriginal tribe. Travelling by camel, she is abducted by an Afghan, Akbar Jhan and his group of aborginals who provide pituri, a narcotic to aboriginals. Previously not allowed into Mala's tribal land to sell his wares, Akbar Jhan has schemed to use Beatrice, a white woman to arouse Mala's interest. Meanwhile the Australian Mounted Police has its hands full with a missing Inspector, an international drug ring, and a tribe of hostile aboriginals led by the savage Moopil who have killed two prospectors as well as searching for the missing Beatrice. Mara buys Beatrice from the Afghans and falls in love with her. The two grow to fall in love.
