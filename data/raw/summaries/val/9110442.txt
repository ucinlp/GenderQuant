In August 1991, Estonia became independent from the USSR and brings to its national bank nearly $1 billion in gold bullion that had been secretly hidden in Paris for 50 years. Russian mobsters have a bold plan to hijack the gold after shutting down Tallinn's power plant at midnight. For this they need Toivo, an electrical technician whose wife is heavily pregnant but urges him to take the job saying "$5000 buys lots of baby food". After Toivo leaves for the plant, his wife suddenly goes into labour and as the blackout occurs the baby needs an incubator, but there's no power. Jealousies within the Mob undercut the plan's smooth operation, and soon the Mob has Toivo to deal with as well.
