Mental patient John Burns  gets the chance to fill in for his doctor when he intercepts a telephone call while being reprimanded in the doctor's office, asking if Dr. Baird could fill in for Dr. George Maitlin  on his popular radio talk show. Burns jumps at the chance to escape the hospital. With the help of Dr. Baird's secretary, he breaks out and picks up a waiting ticket at the Chicago airport, assuming Dr. Baird's identity. Burns arrives in Los Angeles, where he is met by Dr. Maitlin's radio show assistant Laura Rollins  and escorted to the waiting limousine. He crosses paths with Donald Becker , a crazy priest who is collecting money to save plants. Becker recognizes the trousers Burns is wearing to be asylum issue. When the time comes to do the radio talk show, Burns is a huge hit, offering people free consultations and using profanity on the air. He even arranges for listeners to go to a baseball game at Dodger Stadium for free . All goes well until Dr. Maitlin meets the real Dr. Baird in London, when they both attend the same seminar. They fly back to L.A. to try to find what is going on behind their backs. Burns has been paid for the show  and is ready to leave town when he sees on the in-flight TV that Becker is on top of the Hollywood sign shouting Baird's name. Burns decides to go back and help to resolve the situation, where he is arrested only to be rescued on the way to the penitentiary by Becker and Maitlin's assistant Rollins. In the last few scenes of the movie, Burns gives his inmate number "7474505B" which is the same number that Jake Blues had in The Blues Brothers and Louis Winthorpe III in Trading Places.
