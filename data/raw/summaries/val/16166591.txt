Indu and Chandru  fall in love. Indu does the disappearing act and Chandru gets engaged to Rekha . Indu re-appears after three years with a little girl, who she claims is Chandru's daughter. Chandru vehemently denies it and finding Indu's presence an embarrassment tries to ferret out the truth. After many scenes of forced comedy, we learn that the girl is the illegitimate daughter of Chandru's much-married brother, who had seduced Indu's sister. After his brother's futile attempt to play the villain, Chandru latches on to Indu fast enough. And with no apology to Rekha. But it is not really Chandru's fault. For Rekha had done the disappearing act from the scene early enough without any explanation either.
