The ethnic Javanese family headed by Rakhim  is living in Jakarta and trying to make a living. Rakhim, a widow, is raising her youngest daughter, Fitri  with the help of her second child. Her eldest, Farida , has married the nouveau riche Gatot . Meanwhile, the third child, Zulfikar , has become an actor. Two issues arise at roughly the same time. Zulfikar has left his wife  and young child for a cougar with whom he is sleeping to further his career. Meanwhile, Farida berates Fitri for her choice of boyfriend; her boyfriend, Luke, is Papuan, and Farida fears that their family's bloodline will be tainted. In response, Fitri runs away from home. Zulfikar, who is in the middle of filming a movie about a family torn apart by war, is visited by his mother, who tells him that his absence is tearing his family apart. Driven to guilt through his experience with the film, Zulfikar breaks off his relationship with his sponsor, leaving her in tears, and returns to his wife. Meanwhile, Rakhim tells Farida and Gatot that any family is mixed, due to bringing in people from outside the family, and that ethnicity does not matter. Fitri returns home after hiding at her sister-in-law's house. The entire family&nbsp;– including Luke&nbsp;– gathers for breakfast and a photograph.
