The official website describes the film, "Expanding on the themes they developed in Baraka  and Chronos , Samsara explores the wonders of our world from the mundane to the miraculous, looking into the unfathomable reaches of manâ€™s spirituality and the human experience. Neither a traditional documentary nor a travelogue, Samsara takes the form of a nonverbal, guided meditation."{{cite web}}
