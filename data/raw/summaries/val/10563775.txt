{{Plot}} A baby elephant named Jumbo falls from a passing train into a house and as misfortune would have it, into Tom's basket. Jumbo hides himself with Tom's blanket as Tom stretches and goes to sleep. Tom pushes part of Jumbo down such that his trunk is showing, but Jumbo pulls it back such that Tom  pays no attention. Now clear, Jumbo steps out of the basket and runs around with Tom on top of him, causing the cat to bump his head on a cabinet. Tom is confused, but goes back to sleep in his basket again. Jumbo is revealed to have strong suction; he can draw things towards him by contracting his trunk. He demonstrates this by sucking up all of Tom's milk from 15 feet away, waking the cat up again. As Tom storms into the kitchen after Jerry, Jumbo hides. Jerry just happens to be stealing milk from the refrigerator, and a drop of milk falls from his whisker, leading Tom to believe Jerry has stolen his milk. Jerry denies it, but Tom moves to smash Jerry with the milk bowl, ultimately failing when Jumbo sucks Jerry away just in time. Tom is puzzled and walks away as Jumbo and Jerry shake on it. Wanting to further please his new friend, Jerry climbs to a bag of peanuts by standing on Jumbo and retrieving it from the cabinet, but it breaks over Jumbo's head and wakes Tom up for a third time. Jumbo flees, summoning Jerry with his suction, into a closet, before Tom sees him. Tom does, however, see the evidence. Meanwhile, Jumbo sucks the peanuts under the door, frightening the cat and leading him towards the door. As Tom attempts to force entry, Jerry paints Jumbo and turns him into a lookalike of Jerry. They then unlock the door for the cat, and Tom is met with hammers from both Jerry, and then a second time from Jumbo, when he opens the door.  Tom is puzzled and peeks inside when he opens the door again. When Jumbo is seen on the other side, Tom shuts the door in an instant. Tom grabs a baseball bat, looking to beat up Jumbo, but instead gets his foot smashed by Jerry again. The fourth time Tom opens the door, he is met by Jumbo. Due to his size, he faces the cat down and then punches Tom with his trunk, throwing the cat into a desk. Tom returns to the door and opens it for a fifth time, taking shelter behind the door and waiting....but nothing. Then, though, he is snapped back to attention by a crashing noise, and chases Jerry through the halls. He runs back and forth and sees a huge Jerry on the other side . Tom is curious, and runs across a second time, and sees Jerry. He sighs with relief, and for confirmation, runs across a third time and sees only Jerry, but changes direction and this time, sees Jerry and Jumbo. Tom starts to get confused and pokes his head over the wall. The first time it is Jumbo; then Jerry, then Jumbo, then Jerry. When he runs towards Jerry's mousehole and sees a huge mousehole next to Jerry's, Tom figures out the situation and yells in fright. There is already a mousetrap near Jerry's hole, and Tom puts a large mousetrap near Jumbo's hole and runs off. Unfortunately for the cat, Jumbo is on the ball, and turns the trap around and activates his suction. Tom peeks back and gasps as he gets closer to the trap, but he is unable to break away from the suction, and gets caught in the trap. Tom lets out a super loud scream and looks at his tail, which is in the form of a bump. Now, the chases after Jerry, who runs into another mousehole. Tom gropes for Jerry's tail, but Jumbo sticks his out instead. Tom loses control of Jumbo's weight and tumbles onto the stairs with Jumbo on top of him. With everything else exhausted, Tom attempts to shoot the baby elephant, and just misses Jerry in the attempt. Jumbo hides, leading to Tom going after Jerry with the gun. Just then, Jumbo's mother pokes her head through the window and hugs her son. When she sees more shots narrowly miss Jumbo, she scoops him up as Tom continues to shoot at Jerry. Jerry runs outside and sees Jumbo in the garage with a paintbrush, motioning for Jerry to join him. Tom follows the mouse towards the garage and points the gun forward. Jerry jumps out, followed by Jumbo and his mother, decked out in mouse colors too. Upon seeing this terrifying display, Tom's gun droops down as if it were a piece of spaghetti and the cat, , mimicking the sizes of Jerry and the two elephants, and then runs off manically with breaking fences.
