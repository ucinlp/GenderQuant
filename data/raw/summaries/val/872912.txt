Nyah, a sexy, commanding female alien dressed in black vinyl, is headed for London. She is part of the advanced team that is looking for men to replace the dying male population on their planet. However, because of damage to her spaceship caused by entering Earth's atmosphere, she is forced to land in the remote Scottish moors. and has a menacing robot. On Nyah's home world, the emancipation of women eventually led to open warfare between the sexes. The females won, usurping the political power of the men and leading to the complete sexual impotence of the male population. That was followed by a rapid decline in the birthrate. The aliens possess an organic, self-regenerating technology, which was used to construct Nyah's spacecraft. Against this technology, human weaponry proves ineffectual as demonstrated when Nyah comes away unscathed by shots from a gun. However, the alien technology is unreliable and Nyah's people have not been able to use it to artificially produce new offspring. Intermixed with the Nyah story, a pair of romantic sub-plots are followed. In the first, a fashion model, Miss Prestwick , fled to this remote hotel in order to escape a married American reporter, Michael Carter . Michael doggedly follows her to the hotel, hoping to rekindle their affair. Meanwhile, a convict, Robert Justin alias Albert Simpson  who accidentally killed his wife has managed to escape from a prison in Stirlingshire and has come to the Inn, hoping to connect with the barmaid, Doris  whom he truly loves.
