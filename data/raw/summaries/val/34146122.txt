Looking for Moshe Guez follows director Avida Livny as he searches for a childhood memory: his memories from the first Israeli horror film, The Angel was a Devil, which he has seen once in the 1980s, as a 10-year old. Having forgotten about the film, he "discovers" it again in a book by Meir Schnitzer concerning Israeli cinema, where it is described as "the worst film ever made in Israel". The first part of Looking for Moshe Guez focuses on the search in Israel, which was produced between 1971â€“1976, with Guez as the film director, scriptwriter, star, cinematographer, recorder and editor. Among the participants who remember Guez or his film are journalist Lisa Peretz, played by Ophelia Strahl, who described it as the "Israeli Ed Wood." . The second part of the film, which takes part in the Boston area, where Guez and his family have been living since the 1980s, enables us to see for the first time scenes from the "director's cut".
