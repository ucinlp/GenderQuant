The film Seediq Bale depicts the Wushe Incident, which occurred near Qilai Mountain of Taiwan under Japanese rule. Mona Rudao, a chief of Mahebu village of Seediq people, led warriors fighting against the Japanese.  The film begins with a hunt by a mountain river in Taiwan. Two Bunun men are hunting a boar, but they are attacked by a group led by young Mona Rudao of Seediq people. Mona Rudao invades the territory, kills one of them and takes away the boar. In 1895, Treaty of Shimonoseki is signed between China and Japan, and Taiwan is ceded to Japan. Japanese invasion of Taiwan ends with Japan defeating Han Chinese resistance. Japanese military officials see the natives as an obstacle to the resources of Taiwan, and Mona Rudao and his father, Rudao Luhe, see Japanese as invaders. Mona Rudao and Rudao Luhe attack Japanese soldiers and feud with Temu Walis, a Seediq young man from Toda group. The Japanese collaborate with a group of Bunun to get Mona Rudao's men drunk and ambush them when they are asleep. After battles, eventually Mona Rudao's village Mahebu is under the control of the Japanese. Since then, some 20 years have passed. Mahebu village is forced to bury the heads of the killed enemies they have collected. Men are subject to low-wage logging labor and kept from traditional animal and human hunting; whereas women work in houses of the Japanese and give up the traditional weaving work; and children including the boy Pawan Nawi attend school in Wushe village. Above all, they are forbidden to tattoo their faces. The tattoo is believed to be the requirement for Seediq people to "go to the other side across the Rainbow Bridge" after death. There are also young people such as Dakis Nomin, Dakis Nawi, Obing Nawi and Obing Tadao, who adopt Japanese names, education and life style and attempt to work and live among Japanese. In late autumn of 1930, the village of Mona Rudao holds a wedding for a young couple. Mona Rudao goes hunting for the wedding and quarrels for hunting ground with Temu Walis, who is hunting with Japanese policeman Kojima Genji and his son. At the wedding, Yohsimura, a newly appointed and nervous Japanese policeman, inspects the village. Mona Rudao's first son, Tado Mona, offers to share his homebrewed millet wine with Yoshimura, but Yoshimura considers the beer unsanitary as it is fermented with saliva. Tado Mona's hands are also covered in blood from the animal he has just slaughtered. A fight with Tado Mona and his brother Baso Mona ensues. The fight is stopped, but Yoshimura fears for his life and threatens to punish the whole village. Young men, including Piho Sapo from Hogo village, see the punishment unacceptable and urge Mona Rudao to start war with the Japanese. Mona Rudao tells them that it is impossible to win. But Mona Rudao also sees the war as necessary and decides to fight. In a few days Mona Rudao calls on neighboring villages to join force. They schedule to attack the Japanese on October 27, when Japanese will attend an athletic competition  and gather on the schoolyard of the Wushe Village. The women, including Mona Rudao's first daughter, Mahung Mona, know the men are planning for a war and are sad. Dakis Nomin, a young man who adopted the Japanese name Hanaoka Ichiro and became a police officer, notices that Mona Rudao is preparing for war. He comes to a waterfall and tries to persuade Mona Rudao not to start the war, instead Mona Rudao persuades him to collaborate. After Dakis Nomin leaves, Mona Rudao sings with the ghost of Rudao Luhe and determines to start the war. In the night before, the natives attack the police outposts. Mona Rudao then rallies young men from village to village, and at last chief Tadao Nogan of Hogo village agrees to join Mona Rudao <ref name2232 賽德克巴萊之荷歌社頭目 塔道諾幹.....巴蘭社頭目寫了半個月 這次希望能不要超過....]。YAHOO!奇摩部落格。04:34 AM 2011/12/25。. On October 27 the attack takes place as scheduled. All Japanese men, women and children are killed. Pawan Nawi and other boys kill their Japanese teacher and his family. Obing Nawi, a woman who wears Japanese clothes, is spared only because her husband Dakis Nomin covers her with a native clothing. Obing Tadao, who is daughter of chief Tadao Nogan and who also wears Japanese clothes, survives by hiding in a storage room. Native people attack a police station and take the guns. One Japanese police officer escapes and tells the outside world about the attack. The film ends with Mona Rudao sitting in the schoolyard which is full of bodies.  The second film follows the attack on the school. The colonial government sees the uprising as a major crisis, and sends Major General Kamada Yahiko leading 3000 police and soldiers to fight the 300 men on Mona Rudao’s side. The Japanese use machine guns and airplanes but cannot win the battles in the mountains. Pawan Nawi and other boys earn their face tattoos. Dakis Nomin and his wife Obing Nawi, who adopted Japanese names and lifestyle, are caught in ambivalence. Dakis Nomin puts on native clothes, kills his wife and son then commits suicide. Dakis Nawi, a young man with similar ambivalence, commits suicide with Dakis Nomin, but leaves his wife Obing Tadao to live on. They leave their message written on the wall. General Kamada is furious with the stalemate and orders to use the illegal poison gas bomb. On the other hand, Kojima Genji, an enraged policeman, sets bounty on men, women and children in Mona Rudao's village, and orders Temu Walis and his men to fight Mona Rudao. The battle turns against Mona Rudao's side. Many are lost to poison gas and Temu Walis' men. Mona Rudao's people lose the village to the Japanese and other natives and retreat to caves. Pawan Nawi and the boys feel desperate and ask to fight side by side with Mona Rudao. Mona Rudao asks them to recite their creation story in which the first man and first woman are formed from a tree that is half stone half wood. In the retreat the women kill the children then hang themselves on trees to conserve food for the warriors. Piho Sapo of Hogo village also helped his injured relative, Piho Walis, to hang himself. Temu Walis is shaken when he sees the hanged women, and claims that he fights for his own sake not for Kojima. Mona Rudao and his men launched a desperate attack on the Japanese force occupying the Mahebu village. Baso Mona, Mona Rudao’s son, is injured and asks his brother to kill him. Pawan Nawi and the boys die fighting. Meanwhile in a river, Temu Walis and his men are ambushed by Piho Sapo and other men. In his illusion, Temu Walis thinks he is fighting young Mona Rudao before he dies. When Mona Rudao sees the fight is near the end, he gives leadership to his son Tado Mona, and returns to kill his wife and children. Some people of the village surrender and survive. Mahung Mona, daughter of Mona Rudao, is resuscitated by the Japanese, and is sent to offer Tado Mona’s men wine and a chance to surrender. The men take the wine, and sing and dance with the women, but refuse to surrender. The war ends, and even Kamada is impressed by his enemy's spirit. Natives present and identify heads of the dead to Japanese for rewards, and it is shown that in the battle they feud with each other even further. The title cards tell that the surviving people of the villages that rebel are removed from their homes. Tado Mona and others hang themselves in the forests. Piho Sapo is captured and tortured to death. Mona Rudao is missing and his body is found four years later by a native hunter. The hunter then sees Mona Rudao and his people following the Seediq legend to cross the rainbow bridge. The film ends with a scene of several natives telling their creation story.
