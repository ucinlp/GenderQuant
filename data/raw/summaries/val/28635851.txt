Officer Lacy (played by [[Don Murray  is an 18-year veteran of the New York Police Department who finds himself demoted from detective back to patrol duty for his violent tendencies and trigger-happy behavior. Responding to a call on Manhattan's West Side, he finds a young musician named Sally  has been harassed and brutally attacked by a mugger named Rabbit . Rabbit has Sally at knifepoint in a hostage standoff but is persuaded to release her and surrender by Officer Lacy. Lacy kills the disarmed Rabbit anyway. A grateful Sally is convinced by Lacy to lie to detectives to make Lacy seem like a hero. She later changes her mind and tells the truth about the shooting. This drives Lacy to try to silence Sally with escalating threats and violence before his career is ruined and he's tried for murder.
