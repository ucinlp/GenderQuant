Based on a true story, passengers on a city bus must decide what they are willing to sacrifice for their own safety after it is hijacked by a couple of countryside crooks. It is based on two real events, both involved women being raped, one in a train and the other in a bus, while a crowd of people stood by and did nothing to intervene. On the bus, the crooks take over and the passengers must decide how much they are willing to risk for their own safety.{{cite web}}
