A young man  in Spain shaves off all his body hair and turns himself in to the police. The man claims to be a 16 year old boy from Louisiana named Nicholas Mark Randall, who had been missing for four years. His story is that he was kidnapped by a child prostitution ring in France who physically altered his appearance, including changing his eye color. He is reunited with his family who immediately have their suspicions regarding his story. His mother  and half brother Brendan  do not seem to accept him, and many questions are open regarding whether this man could in fact be their lost family member, considering he does not look anything like the boy who left and now talks with a French accent. His sister Kathy  accepts his story without hesitation and eventually so does his possible mother. F.B.I. Agent Jennifer Johnson  strongly suspects that he is lying because she has had extensive experiences with people lying to her, including a man who was a child murderer whom she had dated. Meanwhile, his story starts to unravel and the true story of what happened to Nicholas starts to emerge.
