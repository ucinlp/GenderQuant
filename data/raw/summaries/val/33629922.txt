In the summer of 1942, something is dramatically changing for the small community of Brandon, Manitoba as hundreds of young men from all over the world descend on this sleepy hamlet. In this newly found excitement of meeting newcomers, Lill , a young prairie farm wife whose husband is already overseas for two years, and Pilot Officer Lachlan Currie , a gallant Australian airman are fated to meet. He has come to train at the Royal Canadian Air Force air base nearby to become a pilot. His friend, Johnny Crouch  who has struck up a relationship with Lill's younger sister, Kate , introduces Lachlan to Lill. During a languid moment, Lachlan recites to Lill the poem, "High Flight" by fellow airman, John Gillespie Magee, Jr. which epitomizes what he is going through in his training. Lill recognizes the poem as it had been widely distributed after the death of the young airman who had penned it. The young lovers also have a kinship with another unlikely pairing, Betsy , a bootlegging charmer who sells more than alcohol and also has a husband away in the army and two children to look after, and Zeek Williams , the flying station's chief flight instructor from Chicago. The short period that they have together is punctuated by the strain of dangerous wartime training and their inevitable realization that there is little time left for them. Lachlan has to deal with death from all sides, first when "Scotty" , the trainee who bunks next to him, commits suicide. More devastating is the death of Lill's brother, Dennis  that leads her to a fateful decision to end their relationship, and her sister to cancel wedding plans. When Zack crashes on the edge of the field, he extracts a cruel promise from Lachlan who later seeks out Betsy to tell her what he had to do. At the wings parade, a farewell to the trainees who have earned their wings who will be shortly sent off to war, Lachlan and Lill are unable to reconcile, but Kate remains true to Johnny, saying she will be there when he comes back. Across the parade square, Lachlan and Lill share a final moment, saying goodbye quietly, with a phrase he has taught her, "Fair dinkum." As one of the Australian slang words and terms Lachlan taught Lill, that he says, means: "honest, real, truth.""Fair dinkum." World Wide Words. Retrieved: November 8, 2011.
