Tom , a middle class working employee, finds himself at rock bottom after he loses his job and his girlfriend in the same week. Believing that he has no choice but to end it all, Tom ventures into a derelict squat in East London, in an attempt to purchase a gun from homeless crack addict D . However, D attempts to extort more than the agreed price, in order to pay off his debt to local drug dealer Hoodwink , to whom he owes a significant amount of money. However, the gun is not his to sell - it actually belongs to Hoodwink, who will do anything in his power to get it back. Tom's attempts to reason with Hoodwink leave him with more trouble than he bargained for - and trying to buy him off only gets him seriously abused. Despite trying unsuccessfully to shift the blame onto not-so-macho drug dealer Ray , Tom and D gradually get to know what makes each other tick - and digress for reasonable life - as they try to find a way out of the situation. However, with Hoodwink still on the warpath, the day soon becomes a cat and mouse game of survival for the pair.
