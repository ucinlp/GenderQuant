Zoologist, Nina, plans a trip with her boyfriend Matt to Tasmania to find an endangered species of tiger that has been captured on film by her sister, who mysteriously was found dead in the river of Tasmania. Luckily, Matt's friend Jack and his girlfriend Rebecca help pay for the trip and they come with her. When they arrive, Matts sees a small girl on the boat playing some sort of game with a bunch of teeth. When Matt asks what she is doing, she recites a rhyme and then bites a chunk out from his hand. One night whilst camping in a cave out in the woods, Nina finds one of the Tasmanian tigers creeping through the bush. When the group go out to investigate, Rebecca is captured and eaten by a cannibal. After a series of strange events, Matt and Nina find Jack and a dead Rebecca hanging in the trees with dismembered limbs. When Jack gets up, he falls to a bear trap, and then into another which captures his head. Scared, Nina and Matt flee the area. Through what the cannibals tell Matt and Nina, Nina's sister gave birth to a cannibal child, and was then attacked, where she jumped from a bridge into the river. When Nina reaches the bridge, the cannibals find her and are ready to eat. She jumps from the bridge while Matt screams in horror. Later, Matt is seen at a campfire, drinking from a mug. When he gets into his car to drive away, he finds that the drink was drugged and he could not move. He is then taken by a cannibal, who leaves him in a chair while watching Nina  being eaten by the cannibal. While Matt watches, the same girl from the start turns his head so he can see her, and she takes out her dentures, showing deformed sharp teeth. She then lunges at Matt, saying "I'm hungry!"
