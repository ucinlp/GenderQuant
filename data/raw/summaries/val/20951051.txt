A housemaid  starts a fire in the kitchen stove by putting paraffin on it. It causes an explosion that sends her up the chimney. She emerges out of the chimney pot on top of the house and her scattered remains fall to the ground. Later, Mary Jane's ghost rises from her grave to find her paraffin can and once she finds it, she goes to her final resting place.
