Bounty hunter Ben Brigade  captures wanted outlaw Billy John , who brags that his brother Frank  will never allow Brigade to take Billy John to justice in Santa Cruz, California. Along the way, Brigade comes to the rescue of a woman, Carrie Lane , whom he and a pair of unwelcome new partners, gunmen Sam Boone  and his friend Whit , take along toward safety. But Brigade knows that the reward on Billy John's head is the real motive behind Sam's and Whit's arrival, and that outlaw leader Frank won't be far behind.
