Ji-won is one of the North Korean Assassins who lives in South Korea as a ordinary citizen, until their calling: the assassination of Kim Jung-Il's second cousin who wrote a book that North Korea's Government deemed as a great betrayal to North Korea. However, one of the members betrays his orders to find a new life in South Korea, and Ji-won mistakenly becomes the target for both countries. Lee Han-gyu is a dedicated agent of the National Intelligence Service who tries to foil the hit. Despite having insider information, he tries to prevent the assassination without reporting to his agency and only reporting it to his team. Unable to prevent the assassination, and with loss of his fellow agents in a gun fight, he becomes the sole scapegoat for the agency and gets discharged. Six years later, Lee is now a private investigator who locates runaway mail order brides and a bounty hunter, while Ji-won works in construction. Lee gets saved from a mob by Ji-won and they meet as a coincidence, while they both recognized each other but keeps it to themselves. When Han-gyu recognizing Ji-won instantly, he talks him into working for him with heavy incentive with ulterior motive for his previous unfinished business - as Ji-won accepts Han-Gyu's offer  to spy on him, thinking that Han-Gyu is still an agent.
