Set in the summer of 1976, the movie follows the adventures of Drew Tate , a shy 16-year-old from upstate New York, when he and his family spend two weeks with affluent relatives on Martha's Vineyard. Drew's parents, Kenny  and Brenda , worry that their son is emotionally disturbed. His favorite companion is a doll, in which he names Iago , with which he engages in animated conversations. They also fear that a fire he accidentally set in the family garage foreshadows a future as an arsonist. On Martha's Vineyard, Drew is thrown into an affluent, party-loving black society that congregates on a beach known as the Inkwell. The visit is also the occasion of some bitter family strife. Drew's Aunt Francis  and her husband, Spencer , are conservatives whose walls are plastered with pictures of Republican dignitaries such as Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan . Kenny, a former Black Panther, and Spencer argue furiously about racial issues. The Inkwell follows Drew's bumbling pursuit of the insufferably snooty Lauren . He also befriends Heather , a young woman whose husband, Harold , is a faithless louse. The movie comes to an end on the Fourth of July, when the Bicentennial fireworks end up symbolizing not just America's 200th birthday but Drew finally losing his virginity with Heather.
