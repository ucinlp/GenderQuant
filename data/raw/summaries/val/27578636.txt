Geoff Edgers is a reporter for the Boston Globe. Facing a mid-life crisis, he decides to embark on a quest to reunite his favorite band, The Kinks. Founded in 1964 by oft-feuding brothers Ray and Dave Davies, the group split in 1996 due to creative tension and poor record sales. Edgers travels around America, interviewing and gaining the support of several personalities, including Sting, Paul Weller, Peter Buck, Zooey Deschanel, Clive Davis, Warren Zanes, and Robyn Hitchcock. Edgers eventually travels to London in an attempt to bring together The Kinks' original lineup: the Davies brothers, Pete Quaife, and Mick Avory. Edgers interviews Avory and visits the annual Kinks fan club convention at the Boston Arms pub, where he talks to former drummer Bob Henrit. Ray Davies makes a surprise visit at the convention. He refuses to give an interview to Edgers and requests that the crew not film his performance with The Kast Off Kinks. Later, Edgers is informed that Dave Davies is willing to grant an interview. They meet at an undisclosed location outside London and discuss Dave's relationship with his brother. Dave comments that "I think Ray was probably happy ... for a whole three years in his life, and that was from the age of zero to three, when I wasn't there, and I think I kind of rained on his parade a bit ... I think sadly, it never went away." At the end of the conversation, Edgers and Davies play the song "Strangers" together. He then returns home to Boston. As the credits roll, Edgers and a classroom of children sing Weird Al Yankovic's parody of The Kinks' 1970 hit "Lola".
