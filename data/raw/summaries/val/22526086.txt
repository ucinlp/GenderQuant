Humphrey  and Kate  are two wolves from the same pack in Canada’s Jasper National Park but on opposite ends of the social order. Kate, daughter of the main Alpha male Winston  and his mate Eve , is herself an Alpha and takes her duty to the pack seriously. Humphrey, on the other hand, is an Omega wolf, the lowest of the pack, and spends his days making fun with his other Omega friends. Despite his low rank in the pack, Humphrey falls in love with Kate and is valued in the pack as a peacemaker by virtue of his affable nature. During her youth, Kate left to begin Alpha school with her father. She returns as a fully trained Alpha but on her first hunt , two members of the Eastern pack cross into Western pack territory due to the lack of caribou in their own land. The hunt is ruined and the packs are nearly at war with each other. The two packs have had a bitter rivalry ever since Tony , the Alpha male of the Eastern pack, commanded his wolves to cross over into Western territory  in order to hunt, to prevent their pack from starving. Winston and Tony meet up one night and arrange for Lilly to marry Garth , Tony's son. Kate, having a sense of responsibility and duty, wearily agrees for the good of the pack and she meets Garth at the Howling Rock. Garth is also an Alpha and appears perfect at first in every way, until Kate hears his howl. Kate, taken back by Garth's terrible howl, leaves the scene to "get water". Humphrey then notices Kate and surprises her. The two then talk about Garth, when suddenly, they get tranquilized by some men in the butts and taken away to Idaho. The two wolves wake up at Sawtooth National Recreation Area and meet a French-Canadian goose named Marcel ([[Larry Miller  who has an avid interest in golf and his caddy, a duck named Paddy . Humphrey and Kate learn that they were relocated to repopulate the species. Kate is horrified by the idea, but Humphrey is more interested. Marcel and Paddy agree to help the wolves return home to Jasper. Trouble brews back at Jasper as the two packs discover that Kate has gone missing. Tony warns Winston that on the next full moon if Kate doesn’t return to marry Garth, he and his pack will declare war for their territory. Lilly , an Omega wolf who is Kate’s younger sister, has a crush on Garth and suggests that she shows him around. After a failed attempt to get home , Kate finds a ravine and attempts to cross it. She slips down the cliff, but Humphrey saves her life. After that the two find a den for the night. The next morning, Marcel and Paddy find the wolves and direct them to a train over a snowy mountain that will take them to Jasper. Climbing the mountain, Humphrey meets a bear cub who is unfamiliar with wolves. When they are playing, the cub gets hurt when a snowball is thrown at him. This angers a trio of bears  who think that Humphrey was trying to harm the cub. When Kate realizes that Humphrey is in danger, she rushes in to help him, causing them to slide down the other side of the mountain. Humphrey saves Kate, and, as the train passes by, the two wolves manage to get into a boxcar just in time. Meanwhile Lilly and Garth are bonding. At the midnight howl, Lilli is not deterred by Garth's less than perfect howl and teaches him to howl with his heart. At the same time, Humphrey and Kate begin to howl together as well on the train. Both couples sing in perfect unison. By this time, the full moon has come and the packs declare war against one another. Shortly after, as the train passes by Jasper, Humphrey attempts to tell Kate how he feels about her, but the sight of the packs fighting causes her to jump off the train before he can finish. Kate stops the fight by announcing that she will marry Garth for the good of the packs, much to Humphrey and Lilly's dismay. The next day, a heartbroken Humphrey decides to leave Jasper and travel on his own and shares his goodbyes with Kate, Marcel,Paddy, Lilly. Yet Kate feels heartbroken too after realizing how she feels about Humphrey. During the ceremony Kate decides not to marry Garth, declaring her love for Humphrey. Garth declares his own love for Lilly. Winston is confused while Tony is enraged that his son is in love with an Omega, which goes against pack customs. His pack starts to fight the other pack out of anger, but the conflict is cut short when a massive stampede of caribou interrupts the scene. Winston and Tony get caught in the stampede and Kate and Humphrey  rush in to save them. Kate is hit and Humphrey shields her with her body, and Winston and Tony growl at the passing caribou in order to protect Humphrey from getting hit. After the stampede passes, it appears that Kate has been trampled to death. Upon her seemingly apparent death, the wolves of both packs begin to howl in mourning sadness, but she wakes up to the joy and relief of the packs. Now, at long last, Humphrey and Kate reveal their feelings for each other. Winston and Tony then decide to unite the packs and retire. When they wonder what to do, Marcel says, "Gentleman, may I interest you to golf?" and shoots a golf ball at the screen. Later at the Moonlight Howl, all the wolves celebrate the marriages of Kate and Humphrey and Garth and Lilly. The film ends with Humphrey and Kate singing a duet.
