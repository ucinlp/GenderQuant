Jai and Meera are a modern-day couple living in England. They are happy with each other, but do not believe in tying each other down so, when career beckons, they have a mutual break-up, but decide to remain friends. Meera goes to India, while Jai stays in England, hoping to be called to San Francisco, where working at the Golden Gate is his dream job. Jai begins to date a blonde named Jo, while Meera returns the feeling of her boss, Vikram. The couple believe they have moved on. Running side-by-side, but in a different time, is the tale of Veer Singh. A great believer of love, the Sikh narrates his love story to Jai to try to convince him not to let Meera go to India. He tells how he fell for a girl called Harleen, who moved to Calcutta. He traveled a thousand miles, by train, only to see her face. He also explains how things were different, and the couples then had a lot more respect for each other. Jai ridicules Veer, who vowed to marry Harleen even before he had gotten to talk to her. But, on Veer's insistence, the young man concedes to pay Meera a surprise visit. Meera is stunned, and the two lie to both Jo and Vikram to have some fun together. They go out as friends, and realize how much they still like each other's company. On the day Jai is to leave, Vikram proposes to Meera. She meets Jai secretly, who tells her she should take a decision after thinking. Angry, Meera tells him to leave her, and also says that they can no longer have any contact or else she will never be able to really move on. Parallel to this, we find that Harleen has told Veer she was engaged without being told, and he must leave her. Jai is surprised on Meera's wedding, and tells her nothing can be done now. He goes back, and gets his dream job in San Francisco the same day Meera realizes her marriage is a mistake. She tells Vikram the truth and calls Jai, but he tells her about the Golden Gate before she can tell him what is on her mind. Realizing he is going to San Francisco, she tells him nothing but returns to Vikram's house, dejected. Parallel to this, Veer Singh declares his intentions of marrying Harleen but is badly beaten by her family. Jai slowly begins to lose interest in his "dream job" and is beaten badly by some thugs when, while being mugged, he refuses to give them a picture of Meera. He then realizes he still loves her, and goes back to India. He finds Vikram, who informs him that Meera left him the day that he, Jai, had told her about his job in San Francisco. In the past storyline, Veer Singh travels to Harleen's house on the day of her wedding, and convinces her mother that Harleen can only be happy with him. Harleen's mother lets Veer Singh secretly sneak out with her daughter, and the two marry to have a happily ever after. In the present, Jai goes to Meera's work, at the Old Fort, and they have a heart-touching reunion. In the end, the song Aahun Aahun is played in the theme of Aam Janta  and Pratigya, in which Veer Singh represents Pratigya, while Jai represents Aam Janta. Each shows his different way of love, but both conclude that love has never changed. It shows that, even though, people these days try to make themselves believe that love is just an infatuation that goes away with time and that there is no such thing as "true love" or "soulmate", in their hearts they still love each other with that passion.
