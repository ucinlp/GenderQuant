The Glass Box is based on the lives of two young women in Taiwan. Claudia is a 23-year-old North American who has reluctantly come to Asia with her boyfriend to teach English at a cram school. Yin-May, also twenty-three, was born and raised in Taiwan by her father in a fishing community on the island of Chijin. It compares and contrasts the two people from different cultures in an unusual set of circumstances. The story takes place in the booming metropolis of Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second largest city. Relatively unknown to the western world, Kaohsiung holds one of the world's largest container ports and has seen extraordinary development over the past ten years. Kaohsiung is truly a remarkable city, where old meets new. It is entrenched with various textures and gems distinct to the Asian world.
